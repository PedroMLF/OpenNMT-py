you know , one of the great girls in traveling , and one of the pleasure in the ethnic no@@ graphic research is related to the people who can remember the old days , who can remember their past , still touch them in the wind , to touch them on the rain of glass .
the idea that ja@@ gu@@ ar &apos;s still is going to travel beyond the milky way , or the importance of the earliest of the inuit of the inuit , or that the himalayas is still more important in the himalayas , or in the himalayas , that the buddhist is still going to exist the breath of the dhar@@ ma , which is , in the himalayas , a group of a group of discovery , and that &apos;s the idea that the world of a group of particular possibilities that we &apos;re living with , which is the
and of course , we &apos;re all sharing the same ada@@ c@@ ties .
we &apos;re all born . we get kids to the world .
we go through rituals .
we need to get rid of the loss of loss through death , and so it should not surprise us that we all singing , dancing and art .
but interesting is the unique sound of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
it &apos;s not a matter of whether it &apos;s about the punk in the forests of bor@@ ne@@ o , or the voo@@ do@@ o ac@@ oly@@ ths in haiti , or the warrior in the church desert in northern kenya , or the rebellion in the church of northern kenya , the cur@@ es in the state of northern kenya , or a mo@@ che@@ lic in the middle of the world , with everest in the middle of the world .
all of these people teach us that there are still other breeding possibilities , other ways of thinking , other ways of guidance on earth .
and this is a notion that if you think about it , you can only fulfill hope .
together , the diverse cultures of the world form a network of spiritu@@ ic and cultural life , which is going on the earth , and for the good of the world as the biological life grid that you know as a biosphere .
you can think of this cultural life network as a race of eth@@ no@@ sphere , as the total total of all thought and dreams , myth ideas , inspiration and intuitive , which have been generated by human imagination since the early imagination of consciousness .
the eth@@ no@@ sphere is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are , and what we &apos;re capable of as an astonishing known species .
and just like the biosphere was brought down , it happened with the eth@@ no@@ sphere -- only more speed .
a biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent or more of all species are going on , because it just isn &apos;t true , and yet , this -- the apo@@ kal@@ ed point on the region of biological diversity -- is not exactly what &apos;s known to us as the most optimistic case of the cultural diversity .
and the key indi@@ cator for this is extinction .
when everybody was born in this room , they were talked about 6,000 languages .
now , a language is not just the population of the vocabulary or a series of graphics .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a tool with the soul of a specific culture access to the physical world .
every language is like an ancient forest of the mind , a turning point , a thought , an ecosystem spiritual opportunity .
and from these 6,000 languages today , as we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , that &apos;s not the half to the ears of children .
they &apos;re not taught a little bit more . that means , if nothing &apos;s done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be more lonely than being willing to be one of the last people &apos;s people who speak your language , not to have no possibility of the wisdom of the ancestors , or the hope of having children to expect ?
and yet , in fact , this horrible fate does something on earth , about all two weeks , because every two weeks , an elderly man dies and takes the last sil@@ bs of an old language to the grave .
and i know some of you will say , &quot; it &apos;s not better ? &quot; the world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we &apos;re all going to speak one language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , leave this language in yor@@ uba . let &apos;s be a breath .
let &apos;s be co@@ gi . &quot;
and then suddenly you would see what it would be like if you couldn &apos;t talk their own language .
so i would like to take you in a way to a journey through the ethnic no@@ sphere , a short journey through the ethnic no@@ sphere to try to make them understand what was actually lost .
now , there are some of us who somehow forget that when i say &quot; different possibilities of his being , &quot; really different possibilities of the being .
so , for example , take this kid of the bar@@ as@@ ana in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the ana@@ kon@@ da , believe that they were exposed to the milky age of the world from saint snakes .
this is a people which is not cognitively different between the colors blue and green , because the skies is the forest that people depend on .
you have a personal language , and you have an essay called the linguistic mono@@ gam@@ y , you have to marry someone who speaks to another language .
all this goes on in the myth@@ ological past , the self-@@ equivalent of these large houses , in which of the mis@@ or six or seven languages , is that you never hear somebody learning a language .
you just hear , and then you start speaking .
or , one of the most intriguing tribes i &apos;ve ever lived with , the al@@ oran@@ i in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people who had been contact in 195@@ 8 peace .
in 1957 , five con@@ forms of life tried to record and made a strong mistake .
they threw the pictures of the air down from the air , which we would consider as a friendly gesture , and they forgot that those people from the rainforest had never seen anything .
they raised these photographs from the forest floor , trying to see behind the face or the character , didn &apos;t find anything and decided that this is business maps of the devil , and they killed the five mission@@ ary of the devil .
but the wa@@ oran@@ i didn &apos;t only kill the same .
they went through each other .
fort@@ 54 percent of the deaths happened through sales .
we went back to the genetic ology eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we asked people to do something about it , they decided that one of the people had gotten so old he died , and we killed him anyway .
but at the same time , they have a clear notion of forests . they were interesting .
their hunters could smell the ur@@ ine of an animal from 40 steps away and determine what animal species of this one was .
in the early 80s years , i got a really amazing task , when my professor at harvard asked me to go to haiti , and the secret societies , which were the foundation of the strength of du@@ vali@@ er and clay sound ma@@ do@@ tes , and the ven@@ ds that was used to make z@@ om@@ bies .
and , of course , to give a sense of meaning , of course , i had to know something about this remarkable belief of vo@@ dou@@ n , and voo@@ doo is no cult of the black magic .
in the contrary , it &apos;s a complex meta@@ physical perspective .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked them to count the big world &apos;s major world , what would they say ?
christi@@ an@@ ity , islam , buddh@@ ism , sis@@ ism , whatever .
there &apos;s always an continent going on because the notion was that in sub-saharan africa , there was no religious belief , and of course , there was one , and voo@@ doo is just the surplus of this very profound religious thought that we had during the tragic diaspora .
but what voo@@ doo does so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living sen@@ ters are the spirits .
the spirits can be used by the big water , answers to the rhythm of the dance , to promote the soul of the living temporary , so that acute and a half of us is going to be a very rich moment for god .
and the voo@@ do@@ o@@ cs like to say , &quot; your white goes into church and talk about god .
we dance in the temple and we become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed with the mind , what can you be doing ?
you see , this amazing demon@@ strations : voo@@ do@@ o ac@@ oly@@ ths , in a tran@@ ce@@ o state , the fire@@ end coal without com@@ tru@@ ding , an amazing illustration of the ability of the mind to influence the body so that it feels like it &apos;s going to be in a state of extreme arousal .
now , from all the people i met was the ko@@ gi from the sierra nevada in northern colom@@ bia , the most extraordinary .
pro@@ visions of the old tyran@@ ni@@ ni@@ ni@@ ni@@ ous civilization , which is the cour@@ bian coast of colom@@ bia , and in the consequence of deliber@@ ation , this people moved into an isolated volcanic massive massive , which rises to the heart coast .
in a blood@@ set continent in that mean we mean , those people does mean people mean the only mean people mean , mean , were ? mean , they were the mean people mean that mean that ? &quot; mean , they mean this mean that mean we mean they mean they mean , you mean , they mean this mean all mean maestro mean that mean they mean this mean they mean them mean they mean ? mean we mean a mean we mean them ? &quot; mean . &quot; mean we mean it mean .
until this day , they &apos;re governed by a ritual pri@@ es@@ thood , and the education education is very extraordinary .
the young ac@@ oly@@ ths will be separated at the age of three and four years old from their families , and in a shadow world of the fin@@ ster , in stone boats , burning in stone boats for 18 years .
and throughout this time , they &apos;re being brought culturally into the values of their society , values that keep the claim that their prayers and their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- balance .
in the end of this amazing initi@@ ation , one day , you &apos;re going to go outside one day , and the first time in your life , at the age of 18 , you &apos;re looking at a sun@@ board , and in this crystal moment , you &apos;re going to see , you know , what you &apos;ve learned in the steps of the first light , if the sun is , you know , it &apos;s really what i &apos;m telling you .
it &apos;s so amazing . you must protect does . &quot; does you need does . does it do mean it . mean what does . mean &quot; that mean &quot; ? . mean it mean ! mean , mean , you mean &quot; mean it mean it mean . &quot; mean it mean you mean -- mean this mean ! mean , they mean there ? ! mean you mean . . mean ! mean you mean &quot; mean ! mean ! mean it mean that that mean it mean : mean that ?
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers for the destruction of the world .
now , the level of intuition does so does really mean the mean world does not really mean , that &apos;s what &apos;s important . does this happen . mean , mean , this mean it does very mean in it mean to mean the mean this mean , it mean the mean thing mean to mean you mean to mean the mean it mean &apos;s mean ? mean what mean the mean &apos;s mean very mean now mean to mean it mean it mean this mean it mean it mean that mean the mean very mean ? mean
every time we think about ourselves and landscape , we would think about our r@@ ous@@ se@@ au , and the old ru@@ ck of the no@@ aky wild , which is in his simpli@@ tion , or the other th@@ ore@@ au , and say , these people are more connected to nature than we are .
so , born are not senti@@ mentally mean , you mean the that mean it &apos;s mean in mean . mean mean the that mean they mean soft@@ mean ? mean , the mean , mean there mean of mean stuff mean it mean you mean this mean it mean tora@@ mean are mean you mean it &apos;s mean that mean you mean of mean it mean it mean a mean bit mean that mean soft@@ mean ? mean ? mean it mean a mean fake mean is mean .
it doesn &apos;t stay a lot of space in the malaria of as@@ mat , or the cold winds of tibet , but they have shaped a mysterious ni@@ m@@ bus of the earth , which is shaped by time and ritual a mysterious ni@@ m@@ bus of the earth , which is not based on the idea of being aware of it , but in a far-@@ subtle intuition , the idea that the earth can only exist , because it gets into the human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ? &quot; this mean that does . does it mean &quot; mean , what &apos;s does that mean ? does it mean now ? this mean &quot; it mean . &quot; mean what does this mean ! mean , what mean that ? okay ? ? mean it mean , it mean it ? mean that mean this mean that mean ... mean that mean that it mean , mean , mean that mean , what mean does mean what ? ? mean this mean that mean this ? ? mean that mean
it means that a little kid comes out of the tibet@@ an , which is that the mountain is going to determine that the mountain is going to determine , you know , a very different person , it &apos;s going to be a very different kind of human being , and a different relationship to that resource and this place , as a small kid , is a bunch of rocks .
whether he &apos;s a place of mind ? or a pile what does it matter mean mean , does in@@ does not matter ? &quot; does it mean it mean irrelevant . mean , is irrelevant ? . mean does it mean there does not . mean to mean you mean the mean location mean ? mean to mean the mean &quot; mean ? what mean &apos;s mean of mean &#93; mean it mean not mean as mean ? mean to mean this mean there mean or mean it &apos;s ? mean there mean , inevitable ?
the interesting one is that the metaphor does not mean to does the mean of what is mean from that person does the mean between that individual what mean nature mean , mean to mean the relationship that mean it does , mean that does the mean it mean that mean nature mean nature mean that mean that mean and mean that mean to mean its mean between does what mean that does mean nature mean between mean that what mean it mean in mean life mean it mean and mean its mean to mean its mean .
i grew up in the forests of british colum@@ bia , and i believed that these forests are there .
that took me to another person as my friends under the k@@ wa@@ ki@@ l , who believe that these forests are in the place of the place of hu@@ ku@@ k and the curved por@@ ges , and the canary of the world who live in the world of the world , identify them on their hair initi@@ ation .
now , if you start to think of the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
it &apos;s a picture that i was it it does last april the northwest mean in the mean of the amazon does not what ? &quot; does it happen ? . mean &quot; it mean a ? &quot; mean &quot; ? the mean is mean that mean ? that mean &quot; mean the mean i mean ? mean the mean &quot; ? the mean &quot; mean the mean i mean it mean an mean piece mean in what mean , ? the mean world mean &quot; mean the mean the mean ? mean ? &quot; mean i mean .
this is ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have heard , the most powerful psycho@@ u@@ at from the repertoire of the shah .
so , what ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca does so intriguing is not just the pharma@@ colo@@ gic potential , but its process . it &apos;s going to be made out of two different sources , which is , on the one hand , it &apos;s made out of two different sources , and in the one hand , there &apos;s a bunch of these wooden vents , which is , you know , a bunch of pieces of the coffee plants , which is , you know , with the pages of the coffee plants with the name of
this plant contains some very strong tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine , which is the serotonin , di@@ meth@@ yl tr@@ ot@@ tam@@ yp@@ -@@ 5 and taxon@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ meth@@ v@@ tam@@ tam@@ s .
if you &apos;ve seen the y@@ vind st@@ i , as you &apos;ve seen this stuff , the substance that you create from different species also is taxon@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ meth@@ yp@@ s .
this powder , too , is sort of like being made out of a barrel of a gun , covered by colorful paintings , and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it becomes no distor@@ tion of reality , it does it ? it &apos;s the resolution that reality has does , does you mean that mean it &apos;s mean , that mean you mean , . does mean a mean of reality . mean , the mean problem mean is mean to mean physical mean to mean nature mean and mean a mean resolution mean to reality mean of mean , mean to mean that mean real mean content mean there mean to mean a mean dis@@ mean dis@@ mean power mean .
i even got to my professor , richard evan sh@@ ul@@ te , the guy who has led the psy@@ che@@ deli@@ c ac@@ re@@ a to the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the mi@@ -year-old years , spoke to the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico , and in the moment where you feel the impact , you couldn &apos;t be there .
but the thing that happens with tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ins is that they can &apos;t be used , because in the human gut , , of course , the emergence of the enzyme is called mono@@ am@@ in-@@ oxi@@ d@@ ase .
you can only be used with some other chemicals , that it does so mean the does that mao does have a mean for mean to mean them . mean , mean what that mean you mean will mean it mean : mean of ? &quot; mean what mean is mean it mean mao what mean it mean with mean to mean these mean and mean of mean with mean : mean &quot; mean people ? &quot; mean they mean they mean what mean . mean that mean what mean to mean it mean the mean mao ?
now , the amazing thing is that the be@@ quet@@ s that are in li@@ ane , ma@@ o-@@ guer@@ se@@ oren , are the kind of things that is necessary to power the tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine . ask yourself .
how do these people get from a fl@@ ora of 8@@ 0,000 species of ad@@ vent plants , those two morph@@ ologically unrelated plants , which , if in this way combined , create a kind of bio@@ chemical version , is so much bigger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great eu@@ p@@ hemis@@ m , trial and error , which is what it is .
but you say , &quot; what the indians mean is that , &quot; the plant is speaking to us that way that we mean ! that &apos;s what that means that you say mean . mean that plant that says that , you mean , &quot; mean , the plants mean us mean to mean you . that &apos;s the mean for that , mean ! mean the mean of them ? &quot; mean mean it mean &quot; mean that mean : mean we mean it mean &quot; mean ! ? &quot; mean it does mean us ? &quot;
and so , what does that mean ? &amp; gt does that mean ? &quot; what does it mean ? ? does that mean it &apos;s that ? &quot; mean &quot; that does mean &quot; mean ! mean what that mean ? &amp; does ? mean , &quot; mean &quot; mean this mean that ? does mean , mean &quot; mean this mean that mean what ? it mean what mean ! mean that mean ! mean it &apos;s mean ! mean it mean it mean that ? okay mean what mean , mean of mean what mean ?
this tribe , the co@@ fan , have 17 variations of ay@@ a@@ hu@@ ca , which you see all the way in the forest as a way .
and then you ask them to ask their taxon@@ omy , and they say , &quot; i thought that is something that is made of plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no@@ pe that does not work mean that . that would mean , &quot; no . that is mean &quot; that you ? &quot; mean ? . that is that . mean , mean ? mean no mean ! mean that &apos;s mean . &quot; mean , that &apos;s mean ... mean ! mean ? mean ! mean , &quot; i mean ? &quot; mean , mean no . mean &quot; . mean no mean , mean there mean ? mean . &quot; ?
so , it turns out you &apos;re going to take each one of the 17 varieties on the entire moon , and you sing them in a different scale .
well , it doesn &apos;t take a ph.d. in harvard , but it is much more interesting than land@@ ina .
now , the problem , the problem is that even those of us , the sympathy for the difficult position of being able to look at it as or@@ g@@ ini and color@@ ful , but you look at the past , as the real world , is continuing our world .
so , in fact , you &apos;re going to remember the 20th century , in 300 years , it &apos;s not going to remember its wars or technical innovation , but rather than an era where we were against them and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on earth either to be active , and the vast destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on earth is not the change .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new life possibilities that are involved in the dance of that time that &apos;s what they mean to mean new lives that were that we mean is that you mean it mean with that day that you can mean the mean with new mean possibilities that we mean today that mean it was mean with mean living mean and mean new mean ways of mean this mean ... mean &quot; mean ? mean &#93; mean there does mean all mean to mean different mean lives mean to mean in ?
and the problem &apos;s not the technology that &apos;s in it that does that that that does happen that is that we mean , it is that we mean , it does not . that problem mean , the does that it mean itself is that the technology does not mean , mean , this mean to mean this mean to mean is that the mean , mean this mean not mean that mean , mean it mean that mean there mean this mean of mean and mean this mean not mean of mean itself mean it ?
the sargas@@ x-@@ americans stopped being less in sioux , when they were temple and arrow tasks when the americans stopped being americans when they were horse and horse cars .
not change and technology threaten the integrity of the race sphere , it is power . the ugly face of the rule .
and wherever you see in the world , you &apos;re going to discover that these cultures are not confined to the set , and these are dynamic living peoples , and these are dynamic living peoples , which will go out of its existence in the middle of the south ocean , and it &apos;s going to go away from the capacity of the adaptation , which is , in the middle of the middle of the south ocean , that &apos;s going to take away from the capacity in the south chinese sea , which is going to be
or , when we go to tibet , where i is doing a lot of research , you will see the ugly face of the political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the physical extinction of people , is generally convicted of people , but the eth@@ no@@ cide , the destruction of the lifestyle of people , won &apos;t just be convicted , but it was celebrated as part of a development strategy .
and you cannot understand suffering if you haven &apos;t seen it on the bottom level .
i used to go out with a young colleague of ch@@ ash in mexico china , in western china , from southeast tibet to l@@ has@@ a , and when i came to l@@ has@@ a , i saw the face behind the statistics of which you &apos;re hearing , and i saw the face of the statistics that had been destroyed in be@@ ki@@ y and du@@ ts .
the father of this young man was identified as the followers of the wheel@@ lama that was that that that guy that he that &apos;s been mean that &apos;s that girl that was offered that question that were that he was that guy that was offered mean to mean was that &quot; that guy mean , mean ? mean &quot; he mean &quot; the mean lama &quot; mean of that conductor ? he mean , the mean lama mean , mean , . mean he mean to mean her mean fellow mean man mean to mean his mean .
it meant that he was killed in the chinese invasion that he was immediately killed in that same glacier that that would mean in the middle of the fish that he would mean that that had that sort of that he mean had ? that was what mean of that super@@ invasion mean , does mean he was mean in mean of his mean journalism that had mean immediately that . that mean is mean of what mean it mean the mean was mean during mean , mean to mean southern mean he mean there mean was mean .
his uncle fl@@ ed under her hol@@ iness to that diaspora that people got that way that people brought home that would that way that they would get that in prison that people that had . mean that would mean that mean they mean in that way . that was his mean , that they mean people mean jail that would mean they mean it mean to prison ? he mean it mean he mean to nepal mean to mean that mean they mean this mean that mean was mean in ? it mean ? mean it mean .
his mother was locked , as punishment for that , to be wealthy for that crime for that criminal crime that had that kind that mean ? &quot; ? that was wealthy that i mean about that poet . ? mean &quot; mean &quot; mean , &quot; mean , it mean , ? &quot; mean it mean the mean criminal mean of mean to mean for mean crimes mean to mean for mean the mean , mean for mean crime . mean of mean it mean of mean ? mean it mean of mean crimes ?
he was shipped into the prison age at the age of two of the two years to hide under her sweet pond , because she couldn &apos;t live .
the nurse that would make that ta@@ cker went into an educational camp was that that &apos;s been used that one that was going that they mean in that field that were used that was that kind that would mean it mean that that went mean ? mean he was mean , that she was mean in mean camp that went does mean to mean the that was mean there mean there mean to an mean mean record mean to mean school mean camp mean , mean ? mean it was mean for mean that mean that ?
one day , she came out of an arm ma@@ os , and for the problem , she had to go for seven years into a heavy job camp .
suffering can be immune , but that problem is something impossible to people .
and in the end , we &apos;re really standing on a choice . would we like to live in a mono@@ chro@@ matic world of the monsoon , or in a poly@@ chro@@ matic world of diversity ?
margaret me@@ ad , the great anthropologist in saying that , before she died , it &apos;s her greatest fear , that as we move towards a thread , we &apos;re moving away , we &apos;re not just going to see the entire range of human imagination on an abandoned mindset , but that we would have to wake up one day , and we have forgotten one day .
and it &apos;s hum@@ bling to think that our species has been there for 60@@ 0,000 years .
the ne@@ oli@@ thic revolution that brought us to agriculture , and in this moment , the &quot; cult of the seed , &quot; the poetry of the bl@@ man sat through the pro@@ sa of the prime pri@@ es@@ thood and hierarchy , specialization and took -- just 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we have all the answers to the challenges we are in the following millennia .
if we ask these diverse world cultures after the meaning of humanity , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we will re@@ discover the possibility of what we are : people with all the conscious consciousness that &apos;s aware of the importance that all people and gardens have to be able to be able to flourish , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
this is a photograph that i took on the northern end of the ba@@ ffel islands , when i went to in@@ u@@ its hunting , and this man , colorful , told me a wonderful story of his grand@@ father .
the canadian government is not always very good with the inuit , and during the course of the year of the year , we were forced to pull in settlements .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
the family , the fear of his life , took all the weapons and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit don &apos;t have fear of the cold . they used it to their advantage .
the tracks on the tracks were originally made out of fish , made in a hospital &apos;s skin .
the grandfather was not afraid of the man on the arctic night or the patent storm .
he hat@@ ched out , made his pants out of sea dog@@ ch@@ r@@ f , and he went down in his hand , and when the pressure began , he shaped it into the shape of a pie .
he mel@@ ded on the pages of the fer@@ po@@ po@@ si@@ d-@@ disk , and when it was completely frozen , he would get a dog .
he served the dog and he was improvis@@ ed , took the skeleton of the dog and improvis@@ ed a little bit of the dog &apos;s skeleton , and he would improvise a different dog , and he would get a different dog on the sink on the pump .
you can &apos;t do anything like this .
and in many ways , this is a symbol for the resistance of the inuit and all over the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit in april of the entire control of a field , which is bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new country and it &apos;s called av@@ sty .
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all of them .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state that can look for its citizens and can reach .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who traveled to this distant aim of the earth to realize that they &apos;re not away at all .
they are the countries of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination that go back in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these kids , like the dreams of our own kids , are part of the geography of hope .
what we &apos;re doing at national geographic is that we think politicians will never achieve anything .
we think po@@ le@@ mi@@ k -- we believe that po@@ le@@ mi@@ k is not persu@@ asive , but we think that storytelling can change the world , and we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website get 35 million channels every month .
15@@ 6 nations send our tv channel .
our journals are read from millions .
and we &apos;re taking a series of trips to the ethnic sphere where we take our audiences in places like these cultural wonders , that they &apos;re going to take away from the site of these cultural wonders , and , you know , you &apos;re going to think that the world has made a difference in a really mul@@ ticul@@ tural plur@@ alist world , that the wisdom of all people can contribute to our well-being .
thank you very much . &amp; der . okay . &amp; . &quot; thank you very much . thanks much . &amp; . thanks . &amp; . is . . okay . it much happens . it much has much protection . &amp; . and thanks . ok . now . i much want . it much goes . thank . right . thanks . thanks . thanks . &amp; . , thanks . &amp; . , .
what i first &apos;m going to show you , as fast as possible , is the fundamental work , a new technology that we &apos;re going to get microsoft to be part of a year just a year ago , and it &apos;s se@@ ad@@ ra@@ ra . and it &apos;s an environment where you can either be locally local or away with huge amounts of visual data .
we see many , many gi@@ gaby@@ tes of digital photographs here , which you get se@@ am@@ less and continuously , can re@@ arrange , in any way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at how big these collections are or how big the images are .
most of them are digital photographs of a camera , but this one , for example , is a scan of congress , and it &apos;s in a range of 300 me@@ thal@@ es .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing that can limit the capacity of a system like this is the number of pix@@ els on your screen at each moment . it has a very flexible architecture .
that &apos;s a whole book . it &apos;s an example of non-@@ play data . it &apos;s an example of not very much a much of this . okay . data . this is much for . okay . show . it much , much example . right . show . ok . so . okay . picture . ok . show . ok . show . you . okay . image . this is much for .
this is b@@ ren house from di@@ ckens . every sp@@ old is a chapter .
to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not about a picture , we can do something like this to really show that this is a real representation of the healing and not a picture .
perhaps this is an artificial way of reading an e-@@ book . it &apos;s a book of reading . &amp; . &quot; . so . i . okay ? much of this . i . you know . i very much like this . &amp; . as much &quot; . it much has much artificial . okay . okay . i . ok . okay . okay . that . this . okay . so . he .
and i wouldn &apos;t recommend it . i would recommend it . it &apos;s not recommen@@ king . i would recommend it . you would disagree . right . i &apos;m not recommend . it would recommend . okay . &amp; . i &apos;m much sorry . that much will . &amp; lt . okay . so . okay . this is much un@@ much easy . &amp; lt . okay . i would much . okay .
this is a realistic case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is just the beginning of the very beat . it &apos;s a very much part . it &apos;s a sta@@ ck very much of . &amp; . is the much . &amp; lt . it much looks much a . &quot; . okay . so . . much one . you much need . right . now . ok . ok . ok . this much image very much the . it much has .
and that gives you really the pleasure and the good experience of reading a real paper@@ copy of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of a kind of a relationship with a number of scales .
we &apos;ve also done something on the corner of this particular segment of the guardian .
we designed a wrong ad with very high resolution , which is much higher than a normal ad , and we added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see here .
or other models , or even technical speci@@ fi@@ cations . &amp; gt , or even technical engineers . &amp; ds . right . &amp; ds . ok . it &apos;s even technical very technical much technical . it . &amp; gt . okay . &apos; much technical ingenuity . it very much needs . okay . so . it much new . okay . you . it . it much involves . you much , .
and this really symboli@@ zes these ideas to get these limitations to the available place on the screen .
we hope that that doesn &apos;t mean a pop and other nonsense -- that should not be necessary .
of course , the mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t really want to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we will be contributing to this area .
but these are all the streets in the united states . &quot; ok . all the streets in the united nations . okay . &amp; gt . right . &amp; lt in much america . right . now . okay . so . it much happens . this much has much the streets in much america . &amp; ded . right . and . &apos; much are . okay . so . &amp; . and . the .
up on the top , on the top , you have nasa &apos;s image . you have nasa &apos;s . &amp; dent . ok . so much beyond much , much in nasa . okay . so much more . i . this much announced . it &apos;s much stored . ok . okay . you much gave . i much kept . right . in much this . we . we much have nasa . this .
let &apos;s take a look . let &apos;s take a different out . right . now you can get it out . ok . it much very different from . ok . let . ok . this much different . i much can . now . let . ok . okay . much other . it . right . so much of . you much get . right . ok . this much else . you can .
it &apos;s even live on the internet , and you can shoot . it can you check it . ok . &amp; gt . right . so . &amp; . , much now . &amp; lt . they can . you much see very much today . okay . this much time . this much stuff . okay . this much time . this much is live . okay . now . this . &amp; . in .
this is a project called photo@@ syn@@ th , which actually connects two different technologies .
the one is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ au , and the other is a very good research on computer vision , which is by noah con@@ lier , an undergraduate student college student at the university of steve sil@@ tz in the u@@ w .
and rick s@@ ze@@ li@@ ski was done by microsoft research . a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by se@@ ad@@ ra@@ au .
you can see this , if we create these kinds of views where we can penetrate through images and make this experience of multiple resolution .
but the spatial panels of images is actually what matters .
the computer computer algorithms have taken these pictures together so that these images all have been done in the real space , where these pictures that were made all over the place nearby in the canadian rock@@ ies , you can see , you see here elements of stabili@@ zed slides , or the equivalent of these things , and these things were all in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have time to show you other environments .
it &apos;s a lot of spatial . it &apos;s a lot of spatial . it &apos;s in much of the very space . okay . there much more much space . okay ? much of you . much smaller . okay . i . it &apos;s much space . that very much space is much spatial . okay . there . this is much spatial . &amp; . that much is much dark . &apos; . &amp; . and . they . right . there . they . okay . they . okay . they . the .
i would like to show one of the original data sets of no@@ no@@ th , and this is from an early prototype of photo@@ syn@@ th , where we first worked in the summer to show you what i think is really the pun@@ ch@@ line of this technology , which is photo@@ syn@@ d technology , and it &apos;s not necessarily as obvious as you look at the environments that we have on the website .
we have to worry . because of the lawyers , so much for you , you have to worry . it was like the lawyers . &amp; lt . so . &amp; lt . &amp; gt , much as you were very much afraid . okay . &amp; lt : much more very much , much for much ? much of . &amp; gt . he much needed . it much went . ok . so . i . he much was . &amp; . was much worrying . ok . &amp; gt . so . it .
this is a re@@ construction of the cathedral , which was just in the computer with images of flickr , and they &apos;re just going to be not@@ ed in a little bit in flickr , and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t-shirts and on the school site , and so on . each one of these or@@ thi@@ al bis@@ ses represents a picture that has been detected as this model .
so this is all flickr images , and all of them are in relation to each other in this way .
and this is very simple , you can navigate in very very very very very very very simple ways . &quot; you know , very simple way . ok . you can navigate this very very much way . &quot; much . now . &amp; . so . okay . that much easy . okay . so . right ? much of . right . now . i . right . okay . much now . that much easy . &amp; . &quot; . it . right . you . right . that . right . you .
you know , i never believed i will eventually work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very appreci@@ ative . i &apos;m very thank@@ ful for the re@@ ception of . here you do . it &apos;s very grateful for . it &apos;s much very grateful . okay . now . that much honor . it &apos;s really . i &apos;m much grateful to . here . i much am grateful . i much am much appreci@@ . i much grateful . okay . now . okay . now . okay . that . . much i . you . okay . so . okay . that . right . that .
you can see , you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of cameras : everything is , from the hand camera to professional slo@@ rs , a pretty large number of them that have been put together in this environment .
and if you can , i &apos;m going to find some of the weird . . you can find some of the strange ones . ok . so , you much , much of the strange . i &apos;ll . &quot; much of . how much of that much weird . &amp; much . right . okay . and . it &apos;s much possible . this much i . okay much . that . i . okay . and . that . . . it . you . i . okay . that . okay . and .
many of them are covered by their faces and so much . &amp; gt very much around . etc . , so much about very much on their heads . and so many . right . so much of them , much away . so much people . right . it much is . it much happens . so much by . okay . ok . so . ok . ok . so . . . okay . so . ok . and . it &apos;s much like . &amp; . , much people . okay . .
there &apos;s a range of photographs somewhere . here are the very . it &apos;s here . you can . it &apos;s there . it &apos;s a set . here very much a bunch . okay . okay much . okay . &amp; . , much you . you . it &apos;s . okay . now . ok . so much here . i . this much are . this much are . okay . so . you much here . here . this . ok . now . okay . now . here is . i .
this is actually a poster of not@@ re , which was just recorded .
we can shift from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with the social environment , and it &apos;s now collected data from all -- from all the collective stores of what it looks like -- and everything will be connected to each other .
all these pictures will be connected to each other , and it creates something bigger than the sum of the parts .
they &apos;re getting a model that comes out of all the world . it &apos;s coming out . &amp; des much . &amp; . and you can get much of much . this is much emerging . this much the . right . &amp; . and . this much comes out much . much &quot; . world . ok . i . they you . the much of you . okay . there . that much has . right . &amp; . are . they . . . okay . so . this is much . there .
think of this as the sequel of the work of stephen law@@ ders in virtual earth .
and this is something that happens through the complexity that people use , and it &apos;s growing for the user to get bigger .
their own pictures will be done with meta@@ data , which has a different person .
and if somebody has done the effort and all of these sacred caps , and they share all of them , i &apos;m going to show you who you are , then my photograph of the for@@ re steam cathedral , suddenly , all of a sudden , and i can use it as an origin to diving into this space , and i can use it as a point of view , and i can use it as an origin of the scale of other people &apos;s use of the use of others .
and of course , the side product of all that is the vast virtual models of any interesting part of the earth that &apos;s not just through over@@ flight or satellite images and so on , but through collective memory .
thank you very much . &amp; der . okay . &amp; . &quot; thank you very much . thanks much . &amp; . thanks . &amp; . is . . okay . it much happens . it much has much protection . &amp; . and thanks . ok . now . i much want . it much goes . thank . right . thanks . thanks . thanks . &amp; . , thanks . &amp; . , much thank . right . much . thank you . . thanks . thanks . &amp; . , much of .
do i understand it right ? is it allowing me to make your software that at a certain time , within the next few years , all the images that are being used by someone in the world are essentially being associated with each other ?
yes . it does nothing . it doesn &apos;t happen much other than you can find . ok . it &apos;s nothing much more than discovering you . okay . it does nothing . it much happens . it &apos;s not much like . &amp; . does much more . &apos; much other . &amp; gt . right . you . you much do . &amp; . and . &amp; . is not . they . right . not . . much of . things . right . they . i . this . . much more .
if you want them to make hyper@@ links between the pictures .
and it does this because of the content in the images .
and this is really exciting , if you think about the amount of seman@@ tic information that many of these images have .
how if you take a web search for pictures , where you type sentences and the text of the website contains a lot of information about what it is .
but how would it be associated with all your images ?
then the range of the seman@@ tic frontier and the abundance that makes it make it happen is really enormous . it &apos;s a classic network effect .
bla@@ ise , that &apos;s really incredible . so congratu@@ lations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , the way i hope , in touch with other things that you &apos;ve already heard of , and i &apos;m going to try to make some connections , if you &apos;re not noticed .
i want to start with what i call official dog@@ ma .
the official dog@@ ma of what ?
the official belief sentence of all western countries .
the official dog@@ ma works like this : if our goal is maximize of the common wealth of our citizens , it &apos;s all about the reduction of the individual .
the reason for this is that freedom is good at itself , valuable , meaning , an unprecedented premise for human beings .
if people have freedom , then each of us , for themselves , is to do things that will maximize our common value and no one has to decide for us .
a way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom you have , and the more freedom you have , the more common you have .
this is , i think , so deep in our water supply , that it would not come to mind .
and it &apos;s deep in our lives too .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us modern progress .
this is my supermarket . no big one .
i just want to say something about sal@@ at@@ d@@ ements .
there &apos;s 17@@ 5 d@@ res@@ s@@ ings in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the 10 different olive o@@ ils and 12 bal@@ ambi@@ i@@ v@@ v@@ v@@ v@@ v@@ v@@ v@@ v@@ v@@ v@@ v@@ ms that you could buy to make a large amount of your salad , in the unlikely case that none of the 17@@ 5 is in the store for them .
so , this is what the supermarket is .
and then you go to the consumer electronics in order to put a stereo facility -- speaker , c@@ d player , a cas@@ red player , radio , stronger . and in this one electronics , there &apos;s so many stereo .
we can put together 6.@@ 5 million different stereo facilities from the components that are being offered in this business .
now , you have to admit that this is a big choice . it &apos;s a huge choice . it &apos;s a very big choice . it &apos;s a very much selection . okay . &amp; gt . &amp; lt . &amp; se . &amp; lt much . &amp; gt . so you &apos;ve got to admit . ok . now . you know . so . this is .
in other regions , the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , and you could have any phone shelter that you wanted to get by ma bell .
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
a consequence of that was that the telephone never broke . the telephone was not broken . what was it what it what was the telephone would be the rope . what it the phone was the telephone was never what was the printing the telephone was . the the telephone had the one the rope what was the end the nest the telephone had the never the same the hit the bill what it what was what was the rope what it what the telephone did what was the printing the rope the press know the telephone .
these days are over .
we &apos;re now almost an infinite selection the world the world in the future the mobile the mobile phone the mobile phones the other . the the machine the phone the mobile phone what what we the world the code the code the phone the cellphone are what the cellphone are what the cellphone are what the design the code the walls the . the phones the most the cell the cell@@ the phones the two the design the design the code the . what we know .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite one is in the middle of the middle -- fur@@ 3 play@@ er@@ u , nasa ha@@ ha@@ tri@@ ca and cr@@ è@@ me br@@ tte l@@ é@@ e fac@@ kel .
and if you haven &apos;t seen this in your business yet , you can be sure you &apos;re going to be soon .
and this is what it does the people doing to the shops and the question that the question has to the answer the point the issue the whole the question is what is the answer the question what it is what is the hell the problem the other the thing the point what makes the case . the question the answer the whole question the challenge the problem the whole the challenge the problem the whole the challenge the answer the point the whole the whole the deal the thing the other the problem the whole the .
now , what &apos;s the answer to this question ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
you can &apos;t buy a cellphone the phone the way you know it &apos;s not too much the time you know that what you know ? what does the way what you know not the good the good the thing the hell the way that the heck the way the rules the heck the heck the heck the . the whole the phone the phone the thing the good the heck the way it the the whole the . the game the not the good the good the good the .
in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying points , the same explosion of choice hit .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to a doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , we could do a , or we could make b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b have these benefits and risks the answer what , what does the do what they want ? what what they what do you want to do ? the the problem what you do know the same know what i know you the world the case ? the the question ? what what would the mean the point the hell the hell the hell the do the . what are the advantages the two the . what are the rules what you do the same what you the need the question the one the question what i know ?
you say , &quot; doctor , what am i doing ? &quot; what what should i do ? what ? &quot; what ? what do i want to do ? &quot; the what i want the point what you what am the world what you the heck the heck know ? what to the point the do the other the thing the world the rest the thing the do the other the things the world the rest the rest the day the rest you know of the day know the doctor ? what &apos;s the job ? the
and the doctor says , what &apos;s the advantage the benefits and what , the number what , the risks and the number what &apos;s the option what they know was the risks and risks know what &apos;s the kind of the question . the the case the number what is the treatment what it the nurse the textbook the textbook the year the case the challenge the doctor is the challenge the two the same the doctors the other the celebration the . what it the textbook the other the nurse know .
what do you want to do ?
and if you &apos;re saying , &quot; what is the way i what you know , doctor what , what would you do what ? what would you the heck you what would what do you want ? the &quot; what will you do what what you do what the other the do what ? what if you the other the &quot; what would you be the job the guy the other the world the heck the &quot; the question what ? &quot; the the thing the world the heck the thing would know ? what ? the &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not it . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patients autonomy . &quot; it sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift of the burden of responsibility for making decisions of someone who knows something about the burden of responsibility for the gathering of someone who knows something -- is not the case of the doctor , and it &apos;s not that much of the time .
it &apos;s an enormous marketing for people like you and me , that if you think about it , it doesn &apos;t make sense at all , because we don &apos;t buy it .
why do they adverti@@ se us when we can &apos;t buy ?
and the answer is , you expect to call us the doctor the next morning and ask to ask a change to the point .
now something so profound like our identity what is the answer is what to the point of the the picture the same the screen the future know what this the photo the case the future the challenge the point the show the idea the next the way the movie the subject the same the point the case the future the other the one know the moment the case the case the . what is the picture what to the screen the show the title the other the same the point the subject the title the next the .
we &apos;re not killing identity , we invent it .
and we &apos;re as much new as we want .
that means every day when you wake up the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time in which the standard assumption was that almost everybody had one , and it was as fast as they could , and then as fast as kids could get .
the only real election was , the one , what is the guy , what , not when what was what you were what i the other the . what she the heck the heck the one the real answer is the one the other the one was the other the other the time what i the most the action you know was the case the only the first the hell the heck the hell the heck the case the next the .
now it &apos;s all easy to have .
i teach them wonderful intelligent students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i did .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re engaged with other things , you ask yourself , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i get married now ?
should i marry ? should i have kids , or do a career ? &quot;
they &apos;re all concerned .
and you &apos;re going to answer these questions regardless of whether this means all the tasks that i &apos;m trying to do and not get a good note in my class .
and in fact , you should do this . these are important questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl reveals light , with the technology that allows us to work every minute from every place on the planet -- until the out@@ ing@@ ph hotel .
there &apos;s a corner , by the way , which i &apos;m not going to tell you about , which is the slow drama .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
so what it means is this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of making decisions , again and again and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can look at our kids playing football , and we have our mobile phone on a hip , and our blackberry on other hip , and our laptop probably on our lap .
and also , if you &apos;re all shut down , every minute in which we put our child in the mu@@ bs of a football game , we &apos;re going to ask , &quot; should i accept this call ?
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even though the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to be your experience of the football game of your child very different than it was .
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a matter of choice .
and the world that we lived in was like this .
so i want to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world that we have now looks like this .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to talk about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
it &apos;s a more paradox@@ ical , it &apos;s a paradox@@ ical way to get it to light .
with so many options you can choose , people are very difficult to decide at all .
i &apos;m going to give you another dramatic example of this , a study of investing in voluntary age .
one woman in me had access to investing in investment records , the giant fon@@ d@@ um of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 investment fund who was doing the emplo@@ yer , took participation by two percent .
they provide 50 investment fund -- 10 percent less employees take part than they would only offer five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 investment fund that are available to choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide what to choose to pick it up tomorrow .
and then , you see another dawn another morning and another year another , example &apos;s tomorrow &apos;s and another decade another year &apos;s , another . another one another day another one another thing another is another thing another morning another one another and another way another week &apos;s . another thing another of example does another thing another year . okay . &quot; example ? another , another one another thing another time another morning .
you know , it &apos;s not just that people have to eat dog food , because they don &apos;t have enough money on the rest , because they don &apos;t have enough money on the passenger , it means that decisions are so hard for them to have great investment rates of their emplo@@ yer .
by not participation , they &apos;re spending up up to 5,000 dollars a year on the emplo@@ yer , who would have been happy to reproduce .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it &apos;s just another part &apos;s mind &apos;s going another thing example another that &apos;s true another that &apos;s important another than another , and example . another way another . another time another time another time another is another it example is another look example of another the example this another thing example is another , another time another , another part example ? example that example ? example it &apos;s what another thing .
you want the decision to another point &apos;s really another to another item &apos;s mind another , &apos;s one example . another right example , another right another , another one &apos;s ? another one &apos;s going another to here example here &apos;s another one . another thing another thing example . another , another time another time . right example of example , right ? example . example , you example it &apos;s true ? example .
and they don &apos;t want to another and another investment another thing &apos;s wrong with another sort example . another one &apos;s wrong here another thing another day another . another one example of another is example of it . &quot; example , another bad example to another item &apos;s . example , example , example of another breath another than another in another thing another thing another means &apos;s wrong example to another day example ? example .
so this is the effect . the other effect is that even if we get past the paralysis and make a decision , we end up with less satisfied with the outcome of choice , as if we had the possibility to make ourselves less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is determined by the large array of sal@@ at@@ f , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and it &apos;s not perfect -- and it &apos;s just to imagine that you could have a different choice that would have been better . and what &apos;s happening is that you have a different choice that you could have done , and what happens is that it &apos;s a very good choice .
the more possibilities there is , the easier it is at all not to regret that is disap@@ pointing to the choice that you meet .
second , what economists call op@@ op@@ led costs .
dan gilbert made a big point in this morning by telling how much the way we evaluate things depends on what we compare .
well , if there &apos;s lots of alternatives to think about , it &apos;s just very attractive characteristics of alternatives that you end up with , that makes them less satisfied with the alternatives they chose .
and this is an example &apos;s , example , example &apos;s for example . . another yorker . another woman &apos;s going another laugh another , another person another question . another person example ? another person &apos;s . another person example of another forgive another me another , another york example is another excuse another one . &quot; another , another yorker . sorry example i example of another person example i . &quot; another of example .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple on the ham@@ pt@@ ons .
very expensive real estate .
lovely beach . great day . and another time &apos;s . &apos;s everything another day another thing &apos;s worth another day another one another ? example , another week here &apos;s another man another , another afternoon . example another day , example . another time another thing example of another time . they example you another year &apos;s . another morning another one another thing example of another of example , another time another thing another time .
what would be better ? &quot; another man &apos;s . another one &apos;s thought &apos;s august another in another term another one another thing another day another thing another might another deal with another year . &quot; another &apos; another &apos; another is another one another day another , another point . &quot; example ? another of august &apos;s time . &quot; . another thing another thing another might be example of example ? another of example .
everybody in my manhattan apartment is gone .
i could park directly before my home . &quot;
and he &apos;s a little another student &apos;s lesson another couple &apos;s minds example another year another day &apos;s mind &apos;s left another piece example of another space another week another night another piece another morning another night another week another night another lot another week another morning another day . another piece another year another week another morning another piece another thing example to another time . &quot; example . &quot; another year example of here .
op@@ sexual costs reduce the happiness that we get through our choice , even when what we chose is fantastic .
and the more opportunities for another choice , another more sexy &apos;s attributes another , &apos;s not another than another matter &apos;s costs another result another thing another week another thing another to another point example of another matter another than another , another one another than another can example that . another example that another can example , another result another than example that another matter . another example in example than example it &apos;s possible .
here &apos;s another example .
well , this cartoon has a couple of calls .
it makes a statement about this another and another and maybe another point &apos;s point another story another now &apos;s going another to another and &apos;s another story another , another deal another about another way another story another day another story another to another time another story another to another time another point another story another than another and another one another way another is another , another term example ? another time another way example ? .
but a key point that he &apos;s doing is always , whenever you choose for one thing , you don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and those other things may have many more attractive qualities the time that the other , the way you &apos;re time to do it , the more attractive time to the effect time you time , time is the very time , all the very time things .
third : es@@ kal@@ ation of expectations .
this struck me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in which there was only jeans of a species , and they bought them , and they were bad , they were incredibly unpredictable , and if they had a long enough , and they &apos;ve been used to feel &quot; ok . &quot;
so , to buy new jeans after many years of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few jeans , here &apos;s my height . &quot;
and the sal@@ es@@ man said , &quot; want the spine , the simple time or a wide time , &quot; the end time it the time we time to the es@@ es@@ es@@ es@@ es@@ man . and the seller time , &quot; time it time to .
do you want buttons or mystery ? stone or acid ?
do you want to get jeans with holes ?
if you want to cut down down far the bottom , blah blah blah blah ... &quot; the other time he kept the other time , he the way time he told the title . &quot; he the same time it the time said . time the title .
my jaw was down , and after i told myself , &quot; i would like the way that used to be the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying to try all of these damn jeans , and i left the business -- and i tell the truth -- with the best pas@@ send jeans i &apos;ve ever had .
i was better . all of these choices made the case the decision the way i the time to the next . time the one time , the choice was the case . . time was all time to the time to time ? time time made me .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it to myself .
the reason that i felt worse was , with all these available possibilities , my expectations for what a good few jeans is .
i was very low expectations . i was not the concrete expectations in the way it was the way the only time we had the same the time you the one had the same time in a way . it was the one way .
when they were born in 100 ways , they would have been the kind of time in the head of the car . it was the real one time for them . &amp; ding time for time to the one time they were .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i was going to expect , and what i was expected to do was look at what i was expecting .
the adding of possibilities in humans is increasing the expectations of people , the expectations have time to be the ability the way time is the possibilities the possibility is all the way to the option . &amp; der time that time can be .
and that leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good at the same time than the performance the results the results are okay . ok . okay . it &apos;s time for the outcome .
no one in the world of marketing knows this , because if you would , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing here .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is , once everything was worse than everything was worse than everything was worse , it was possible for people to make experiences that were a pleasant surprise .
today , in the world that we live in -- we &apos;re wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfe@@ ction as expectation -- the best for you to hope is as good as you would expect .
they &apos;re never going to be surprised to be surprised by the expectation of the argument , the expectations , my expectations the high time is the way time , to the rest time , the high time to the next time is .
the secret of happiness -- that &apos;s what you all got -- the secret , the legal the content time , is tiny expectations .
i want to say -- a quick autobio@@ graphic moment -- i &apos;m married with a woman , and it &apos;s really quite wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t leave .
but not always is a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of buying a bad seat of diarrhea , if it &apos;s just a way to buy , is that if you &apos;re im@@ satisfied , and you wonder why , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is clear . what would you have done ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and you buy one that &apos;s disap@@ pointing , and you ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is , you know .
they could have done better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the window , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , when people make decisions , and even when the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed , they accused themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a significant thing -- not the only thing , but a significant pack to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have learned that because their standards are so high . and then , if you have to explain these experiences themselves , you think it would be their fault .
and so the idea is that it &apos;s more likely to happen to us , objective , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official dog@@ ma , which is one that we all think of right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question , which is more selection than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow more choices than a choice .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed this period for a long time to make choices better .
now , as a rule -- i &apos;m almost done -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a policy question , which is thinking about what makes all this choice in the developed societies , is the material .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of them , whose problem is not too big .
your problem is that you have too little .
so the things that i &apos;m talking about is a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and depressed is , steve levi@@ tt has told you yesterday about how those expensive and hard car seats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy that they don &apos;t help .
they even hurt .
they worry about that we are worse .
if something of the people in our society allow us to make decisions so much to the societies in which people would have a little choice , not just the lives of people , but our dignity will be improved .
economists call this a par@@ et@@ o threat .
income re@@ distribution is going to make it happen all better -- not just the poor -- because all of these big choices are pla@@ sting us .
finally , read this cartoon , and , you know , an evolved person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know it can be done in this gold@@ fish glass . &quot;
un@@ tested imagination , a very rigid view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
the more i thought about it , the more i came to the view that the fish knows something .
because the truth is that if you break the gold air glass , so everything is possible , you have no freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the gold@@ fish glass , so everything is possible , you reduce happiness .
they increase paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs an gold@@ fish glass .
this is almost more likely to limit security -- perhaps for the fish , definitely for us .
but the ab@@ han@@ den of an abstract gold@@ fish glass is a recipe for misery , and , i guess , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what that might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code into a new phase of biology by creating new lives and building new lives .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask significant questions .
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something i think many biologists have tried to understand and that on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different approaches to simplify it up to the minimal components .
we &apos;ve digitized nearly 20 years . when we sequenced the behavioral genome , the shift from the analog world of biology to the digital world of the computer .
now , let &apos;s try to wonder whether we can regenerate or whether we can make new lives , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , you know , the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we tried whether we can do this with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it at about a hundred genes from the 500 or something that are here .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , in terms of our own . trust me , that &apos;s easy , but if we all look at these genes that we can eliminate one after the other , it would be very unlikely to take that to a living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to go forward to this chromosome , actually , which allows us to vary the single components and make some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , so we can synthetic a chromosome ?
it allows chemistry to create these really large molecules , which has never been done before ?
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is just a piece of odd material , by the way .
our steps of adding life was exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code has been evolving very slowly , but our final point would be now on an exponential curve .
we started with it 15 years ago .
it took a few years ago with a bio@@ ethical review before we did the first experiments .
as it turns out , dna synthetic is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make the little bits of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a de@@ generic process , so the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes happen .
so we had to design a new method with which we could put these little pieces together and fix the mistakes .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome ph@@ i x 17@@ 4 .
it &apos;s a small virus of bacteria .
we made small pieces , made a error error , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting stage came when we took this piece of in@@ taken chemical and put it into a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles then got rid of the cells , and then went back and killed coli .
i &apos;ve been talking to the oil industry recently , and they said that this was the model of the day .
they laughed more than her .
so we think this is a situation in the software , actually , to build your hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go a lot further . we wanted to build an entire bacterial chromosome . it &apos;s got more than 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters genetic code , so we thought , we &apos;re building it in cas@@ ets of the size of the virus , which is to understand what the single components of a living cell are .
design is the key , and if you start to start with digital information in the computer , these digital information really has to be mis@@ able .
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the error rate was a 10,000 base pairs .
we found , in fact , in res@@ dense 30 mistakes . if we used the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
a part of the design is to create pieces for 50 letters long , and they have to get over the other 50 letters to build smaller sub-@@ units to build these together .
we have unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built water@@ signals .
think about it : we have a four-@@ letter code : a , c , g .
the letters of these letters -- these letters encode about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
we just started writing .
some people were disappointed that there was no poetry .
we &apos;ve built the pieces so that we could just put them away with enzymes . there are enzymes that can repair this and re@@ assemble that .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces of the five to seven letters , and they put them together to make these together at 24@@ ,@@ 000-@@ letter pieces to put them together , up to 7@@ 2,000 .
in each step , we produced these pieces in the surplus so we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process of what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get to the point of auto@@ mation .
so , this looks like a basketball poster .
now , if we get to these really large pieces -- over 100,000 bases -- then they &apos;re not going to grow in e. coli , and they &apos;re going to grow all the possibilities of modern molecular biology , and so we went to other mechanisms .
we knew from a mechanism of the hom@@ ologist , which is used by biology to repair dna that can put pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of it . there &apos;s an organism called d@@ ein@@ o@@ coc@@ cus radio dur@@ st , which is the three million ra@@ ils of radiation .
you see in the upper field that his chromosome just drops apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything has been combined again as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
these organisms can be completely dry , they can even live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life exists in space and can move , looking for aquatic conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of them out there .
here &apos;s a shot of the molecule that we &apos;ve created by using these processes -- in fact , we &apos;ve been using guns mechanisms with the right design of the pieces , and we put them in it . yeast will automatically put it together .
this is not a electron microscopic recording it &apos;s a regular strand .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it with the light microscope .
these are footage over a period of six seconds .
this is the publication that we &apos;ve just done recently .
this is over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code . it &apos;s the largest molecule with defined structure ever created by humans .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
if we would print it to the size of 10 and without a distance , it would be 14 pages just to print this genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we turn it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated to cope with bacteria .
it &apos;s as easy as you &apos;re in eu@@ kar@@ y@@ on@@ s , as we &apos;re doing : you just take the nucleus out and you have another one in it , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about the clone .
in archae@@ bacteria , the chromosome is embedded into the cell , but recently we &apos;ve shown that you can do a complete transplant of a chromosome to another , and it can activate it .
we used to clean the chromosome of a micro@@ species . roughly , these two things are from each other as humans and mice , and we gave them some extra genes so we could choose this chromosome , and we took it to the enzymes to destroy all the proteins -- and it was very amazing when we put it in a cell -- and it &apos;s very amazing to be able to estimate our very distinctive graphs .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought this is the end , but we &apos;ve tried to move a little further .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we find all kinds of species here that have taken a second chromosome or a third of any time , or a third of them , every thousands of characteristics in just one second to a species .
so people who think of evolution as a gene will have changed a lot of biology .
there are enzymes called the restri@@ ction@@ als , which are actually being called dna .
the chromosome in the cell has no ; the chromosomes that we &apos;ve added .
it was ex@@ pri@@ red in the cell , and the other chromosome di@@ pped it as a foreign material , and so we just ended up with a cell with a new chromosome .
it ruins blue because of the genes that we added .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of the species , and all the characteristics of a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given into the cell .
all the proteins changed , and when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;ve been doing .
it might sound like genom@@ ian al@@ chim@@ y , but we can do the software dna , changing things quite dramatically .
now , i argued that this is not the gluten -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i said that we might be able to create a new form of the cham@@ brian explosion in which there might be massive new species of wildlife based on this digital design .
why should we do this ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious about what we need .
we &apos;re about six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
in order to put it in my context , i was born in 194@@ 6 .
today , three people on this planet are on the planet in 194@@ 6 ; in 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , fresh and clean water , medicine , for 6.@@ 5 billion people .
it becomes a challenge for 9 employees .
we need five billion tons of coal , 30 plus billions of barrels of oil . that &apos;s a hundred million barrels per day .
if we think about biological processes , or any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 of this material landing in the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries around the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
the electric industry had a dozen components , and look at the diversity that came from it .
we &apos;re in first line to the boundaries of the biological reality and on those of us .
we have these sorts of technologies today because of these fast gharial techniques to do what we call combin@@ atori@@ ian genetics .
we now have the opportunity to build a large robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
if you imagine making these 20 million different genes , or these processes to produce the topo@@ ents , or drugs new vaccines , we can actually change more molecular biology than the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s just like selection , and we can cheat with life , production of chemicals or fossil production production and so on .
this is a shot of effective design software that we &apos;re working on to actually sit down and design new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it &apos;s going to look . we know exactly what their genetic code will look like .
we &apos;re now focusing on the fourth generation .
they &apos;ve recently seen corn to ethanol , which is just a bad experiment .
we &apos;ve got sources of the two and third generation that will be relatively soon , that will have much higher sugar gaps , like oct@@ ents or different kinds of bu@@ tan@@ ol .
but , as we think , the only way to think about biology is a major impact without the cost of food , or the limitation of their availability , when we see co2 as the initial material , and so we work on cells that go .
and we think we will be the first generation of the fourth generation , and it &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of different ways .
this is a organism we described in 1996 .
it lives in the deep sea , about one-@@ and-a-half miles deep , almost boiling water temperatures .
it changes co2 in methane in using hydrogen as a source of energy .
we study whether we can use carbon co2 , which could just be made to production , convert the co2 into fuel to make this process .
within a short period of time , we might think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we have really -- moder@@ ate goals like the total petro@@ chemical industry . right . if you don &apos;t want to do that at ted , where else ?
but in the same way , we &apos;re currently working on the same approaches to the development of vaccines .
you &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year back , and we have a dollar too little when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think this can be changed by making re@@ assembling vaccines .
this is how the future might be able to look at it with changes , today , the evolutionary tree is accelerating with synthetic bacteria , arch@@ a@@ en , and perhaps eu@@ kar@@ y@@ on@@ s .
we are able to improve from people . our goal is that we have an opportunity to survive long enough to be able to do that . thank you very much .
on the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain how the machine works .
so it &apos;s going on . and for all those those who weren &apos;t there at the time , the lhc is the biggest scientific experiment ever -- 27 miles across .
his job is to create the conditions that exist less than a billion@@ th of a second after the beginning of the universe -- and it was up to 600 million times in a second .
it &apos;s just breath@@ taking ambitious .
this is the machine underneath gen@@ f .
we take pictures of these mini-@@ big big giants in detectors .
this is what i do . it &apos;s called an atlas detector -- 44 feet in the diameter , 22 meters in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in order to see the scale .
last september of september last year , the machine was the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it takes place in the control of the control .
it &apos;s a picture of the first soft score , which all the way back to the lhc , then interacting with a part of the lhc to make a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture at september 10th , we knew that the machine is a great triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this created the biggest , or this , when someone went to the google page and found the front page .
it means we get a cultural impact next to the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine to do with these wires -- these golden wires here .
these wires are 13 thousand am@@ lets when the machine runs on high performance .
now , the engineers are going to look at them and say , &quot; no , no . they &apos;re little wires . &quot;
you can afford that because if you cut it down very far , you will become called &quot; super@@ pris@@ ers . &quot;
so in minus 2@@ 71 degrees , cooler than the space between the stars , these wires can maintain tension .
in one of the connections , between the billions of thousand magnets in the lhc , there was a piece of contact .
and then , the wires , the wires , have seen less and 13@@ -@@ thousand a thousand .
so that was the result . this is the result of . it was happening . &amp; ding . okay . &amp; . that was . . &quot; much &quot; . okay . now . this was much a much result . right . okay . now . okay . here . . much since . that much time . he . okay . he . . . right . now . he . right . here . he . ok . that . this . &amp; . &quot; .
now , all of this is even more impressive if you think the magnet weigh over 20 tons and move around about 30 inches .
so , we killed about 50 of the magnet . so we would be ashamed of what you would be doing . okay . so we &apos;re much ashamed of about 50 of the magnet very much on it . &amp; ced . it much har@@ much murdered . ok . okay . that much , very much to much damaged . it much fails . ok . so we much damage much more . it much hurt . right . now . that &apos;s much what . this .
and i had to take them off what we did . and we had to take it . okay . &amp; lt : and you . it very much happened . it was much like very much , too . okay . what much was much like . i . you much , much of us . right . okay . okay . so . what much people . i . okay . okay . and . what . &amp; . is . he . they much did .
we re@@ capit@@ tioned them , they re@@ paired .
now , they are all . you &apos;re all back back in your way back . right now . it &apos;s all back on very much then . i very much go back . you &apos;re much going . okay . ok . okay . i much go . ok . i . okay . i . right . okay . okay . okay . okay . okay . they . okay . okay . you &apos;re . right . okay . i . i . they . okay .
at the end of march , the lhc will be able to function .
we &apos;re going to turn it to , and we can collect the first data in june or july , and we &apos;re going to move our journey to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
well , of course , in a way , these accidents are re@@ plying the value of science and engineering on such boundaries . it &apos;s easy to reject something like this .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard is the fact that we reach beyond our borders , the value of things is the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my closest words of a english scientist , hum@@ ph@@ rey da@@ vy , who , as i suspect , was defending the use of the use of his peers , his instru@@ ver , his instru@@ ver , was michael far@@ a@@ day , his instru@@ lt , that we &apos;re saying , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind , &quot; that there are no mystery in nature , they have no new worlds . &quot;
thank you very much . &amp; der . okay . &amp; . &quot; thank you very much . thanks much . &amp; . thanks . &amp; . is . . okay . it much happens . it much has much protection . &amp; . and thanks . ok . now . i much want . it much goes . thank . right . thanks . thanks . thanks . &amp; . , thanks . &amp; . , much thank . right . much . thank you . . thanks .
and i &apos;m a writer . i &apos;m a leader . right ? i &apos;m a writer . &amp; lt . &amp; amp . &amp; amp . &amp; se . &amp; gt : much &quot; i &apos;m writer . i &apos;m writer . &amp; gt . ! . &amp; gt . boy . &amp; lt . am . &amp; . &#93; . &amp; lt . &apos; much &quot; . boy . boy . right . this . you . the . it . is . &amp; gt . you .
writing books is my job , but it &apos;s more than this .
it &apos;s also my big , life-@@ long love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that to change the way ever .
however , a little bit odd in my life and my career is something that has brought me to this work completely .
now , this strange event was that i recently wrote a book -- a biography called placebo food , bust , love -- and that , unlike all my previous books , from some reason to the world , and have been a great mega-@@ event , the international name of the world .
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to be treated as though i was in .
seriously , i would you . i &apos;m going to tell you the very thing . i &apos;m going to tell you about much &quot; . that &apos;s what much he was much serious about . boy . &amp; lt . &apos; much he much pis@@ . it &apos;s much more . &amp; ding . . much of much the . it much fre@@ . this much fun . he very . &quot; much he much refused to . it much passed . &amp; lt . it . he .
for example , you &apos;re going to worry about me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you will never meet this success ?
don &apos;t they have a fear that they &apos;re going to write their entire life and never create a book that cares anyone in the world ?
okay , so that &apos;s very , very audac@@ ally . it &apos;s a very affe@@ ct power . okay . ok . it makes you worthwhile . ok ? much . that much does it . ok . really . ok . it does much fun . ok . so . ok . it does much &quot; . this . okay . i . ok . do much , . that much harm . does . it much makes . okay . . okay . i . . .
it would be worse , if i don &apos;t remember that i was about 20 years ago , when i first told a teenager for the first time , i wanted to be writer with the same kind of anxiety response .
people said , do you have no fear of having no success ?
do you have no fear of telling you the humili@@ ation of one ?
don &apos;t you worry that you &apos;re going to go to your life , and you never come out of it , and you &apos;re going to die on a black house , you &apos;re going to die -- your mouth filled with the bitter ray of failure ?
it &apos;s about , you know , you know , you know , is very much . it &apos;s already . right . it has much been . it much goes on . it &apos;s like . &amp; . right . . &amp; . &apos; much &quot; . it . it much goes on . . . &amp; . &apos; . ok . now . i . . . ok . i . right . now . right . i . right . i . so . ok . .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : explode .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all of these things , you know , i &apos;m afraid of all of these things . right . i &apos;m afraid of this . i much fear of this . it much was afraid much . this much time . &amp; . is all much fun . ok . now . this much of . that much time . this much happened . ok . this much i . that . right . &amp; . and . this . right . this .
and i always had them .
and i have a lot more of these things that no one would be able to get .
like algae -- and other terrible things .
but when it comes to writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about this , and i &apos;ve been wondering , why ?
is that rational ?
is it logical that someone should be expected to do the job that he feels to do ?
and what &apos;s wrong with the creative enterprise , that it makes us insecure about the mutual state of mind -- in a way that other jobs don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemist , and i can remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist who was asked to be a chemist .
with your chemist , john , john -- how do you do it ?
it just didn &apos;t happen , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemi@@ sts have not been able to get the call of alco@@ hi@@ ctive depressi@@ ia people .
we seem to be writer , but not just the writer , but not just the writers , but the creative of all gene , seem to have that call , mentally immensely unstable .
everything you need to do is look at the bitter death numbers of really great minds from the 20th century , who died young and often died .
and even the ones who don &apos;t actually have sui@@ cide was actually being neglected by their talents .
norman ma@@ iler said shortly before his death in his last interview : explode every one of my books had killed me a little bit .
it &apos;s an extraordinary statement that you can make about your life .
but we don &apos;t even know if we &apos;ve heard somebody like this , because we &apos;ve been familiar with something like this , because we &apos;ve been familiar with the way that we &apos;ve been doing this so long , and colle@@ ctively , that creativity and suffering is , of course , that creativity and suffering -- the end of the sea -- always leads to the sea .
the question i want to leave you with here today is , is this an idea for them .
feel that ? because with just one centimeter away -- i feel that i don &apos;t think about that perception at all .
i think it &apos;s not .
and i think it &apos;s dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to watch how it &apos;s taken to the next century .
i think it &apos;s better when we encourage our great creative experiences .
and i definitely know that for me -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start , start to start with this dark path of ownership -- especially in the case that i just found in my career .
this is -- you see , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 working years in me .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything that i &apos;m going to write from the world is being driven by the world , who came after the end success of my last book , right ?
i &apos;m going to say it , because we &apos;re now all kind of friends -- it &apos;s very likely that my greatest success is behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
that &apos;s the kind of thought that anyone can get to do at 9 o &apos;clock in the morning , to drink gin , and i don &apos;t want to .
i would prefer to do this work i love .
so the question is , how do we ?
after some time of the reflection , i seem to say that i could continue writing , a kind of protective psychological constru@@ ct .
in a way , i have to find a way of writing a certain distance in true between me and my very natural sense of how the reaction will be on the writing .
in the past year , i &apos;ve been looking for models for doing this , i &apos;ve been looking at the past , and i &apos;ve been trying to find other societies , to see if you &apos;ve been able to get better or worse ideas about how you can help to deal with the emotional risks that are related to creativity .
this quest me in the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will close .
but in the old greece and rome , people don &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of divine kind of divine mind , which was out of a distant , unknown source of people -- from unnecessary , unknown reasons .
the greeks called this divine di@@ fu@@ al spirits , the creativity of creativity .
from so@@ crates , he thought he would have thought he was going to have a paper who gave him no longer .
the roman@@ mer had the same idea , and they created this kind of body &apos;s creative mind , a perpet@@ ual genius .
this is great . the roman didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly clever individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical divine creature , which was thought that it was literally in the walls of an artist in an artist -- sort of like do@@ bby , the domestic 11 -- who would come out and create the kind of work that was invisible .
this is brilliant -- there it is , it &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological construct that protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew it was so worked , right ?
the artist of aging was protected in certain things , like , for example , too much nar@@ cis@@ is@@ sm , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you don &apos;t want to look at everything for you . everybody knew that you had this body genius that helped you .
if your work blew -- not completely your fault , right ?
everybody knew , your genius was something .
so people in the west have really been thinking about creativity a long time .
and then the renaissance and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea : let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe -- across all the gods and mystery , and there &apos;s no room for my@@ stical creatures taking orders of divin@@ ity .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational human@@ ism , and people started to think that creativity was completely from their individual .
for the first time in history , people hear this genius , or this artist , a genius -- instead of having a genius .
i must tell you , i think that was a great mistake .
you know ? i think to allow a person to think he &apos;s thinking , or she was like the vessel , like the basin and the essence , and the source of all divine , creative , unknown , infinite mystery to be a small amount of responsibility of human psyche .
it &apos;s like asking somebody to smile the sun .
and this is what &apos;s going on and distorted all the egos , and it creates all this un@@ easy expectations to success .
i think this success pressure has wiped out our artists for the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
perhaps to return to an ancient understanding about the relationship between people and the mystery of creativity .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t let the thought of thinking well from 500 years of human@@ ism in an 18-@@ minute talk .
and there &apos;s certainly people in this audience who would have really celebrated scientific doubt on the notion of -- basically -- fe@@ en that people follow and fe@@ en@@ ad on their projects and so forth .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to suggest is why not ?
why not think about this ?
because it makes a lot of sense as much as anything that i &apos;ve heard about when it was about explaining the absolutely insane cap@@ ity of the creative process .
a process that -- like everybody knows it &apos;s ever trying to make something -- in other words , in other words , everyone here -- not always reasonable .
in fact , he can feel really accurate sometimes .
i &apos;ve been in a recent encounter recently , when i met the extraordinary american di@@ ter in ru@@ th stone , which is now about 90 , which was more di@@ qu@@ ed , and she told me that she was growing up in the temple virginia , and she said she was going to feel and hear about the landscape .
she would say it would be like an x-ray of air .
it would roll on the land .
she felt when it came , because it would bring the earth under their feet .
she knew that in a moment , she was able to do one , and that was -- in her words , it was like the bat .
she ran like the devil to the house as she was tracking by this poem , and it was simply because she had to get fast enough to get into a piece of paper and a pen , so she could get it through it , to capture and capture on the sheet .
in other paintings , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran and ran , but she did not get the house and the poem went through her , and she would go through it , and she would say it would move over land , and -- and she said it would go to a different poet .
and then there were these moments -- the part i &apos;ll never forget -- she said that there were eye eyes in which they almost took it .
so , she goes to the house and look for the paper , and the poem goes through it , and it grabs a pen as it goes through it and then -- she said -- it was as if it was to reach with her other hand .
she kept the poem in his tail , and she pulled it back into her body and took it into the sheet of paper .
in this occasion , the poem came down and intact on the paper -- but backwards -- from the last word for the first .
when i heard that , i thought , i think , this is unacceptable -- that &apos;s exactly what my creative process is .
it &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a star jelly . to work , i &apos;ve got to get up at the same time , and i wake up , and i &apos;m going to break up , and i &apos;m really uncomfortable .
but even in my mouth , i have this thing .
and i guess many of you have done that too .
even i had work or ideas that came from a source through me through me that i really can &apos;t identify .
what &apos;s the thing ?
and how do we deal with it without losing our minds , but to keep ourselves in the contrary of intellectual health ?
for me , the best living example of how you can do this is the musician tom wa@@ its , i was allowed to interview him a magazine ago .
we were talking about this topic , and you know what ? most of the time in his life , tom was the embo@@ diment of the embarrassing modern artist , trying to get this un@@ controlled creative pulse that was living in him and reaching them .
but then he became older and quiet , and he told me he was driving one day in los angeles in los angeles , and it changed everything .
he went at high speed when he &apos;s suddenly hearing a little fragment of a tune , which , as opposed to inspiration , is often difficult for him , and he wants to do it . it &apos;s delicious . it &apos;s delicious , but he can &apos;t touch it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have a cas@@ ad .
so , he starts to rise to this old ground , like , for example , i &apos;m going to lose this thing and get lost by this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m not making it .
but instead of sitting in panic , he just stopped .
he left the whole thought , and he did something completely new .
he just looked in the sky , and he said , &quot; sh@@ sorry , can you see i drive cars ? &quot;
i just look like i could write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a more cheaper moment when i can take care of you .
if you don &apos;t , you have somebody else .
go and wave leon@@ ard cohen .
his whole process has changed afterwards .
not the work itself . it was always as dark as ever and ever .
but the process and the heavy one that surrounds it was when he took the genius out of it , where he was doing nothing in trouble , and he went back to where he came from where he came from . he realized that it had to be no intern@@ able thing .
it could be an amazing , wonderful , bizarre , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the alien , obvious thing that wasn &apos;t quite tom .
when i heard this story , it also changed a bit of the way i worked , and it has saved me before .
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of the writing of trauma , bust , love of the two rock that we all fall in , when we go to something and not work . you start to think that it &apos;s going to be a disaster . that &apos;s the worst book ever written .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just get the project out .
but then i remembered how tom talked to the free-@@ sky , and i tried it .
so i took my view from the manuscript , and i was talking about the comment in a lower corner of the space .
i spoke , you know , you know , you know , you , and i know both , if this book isn &apos;t brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see , i &apos;ve got everything i &apos;ve got . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so , if you want to have it better , you &apos;ve got to check up here and take your share of it .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , you know .
i &apos;m going to continue writing , because this is my job .
and i want to give up , i think , for my part of the jobs here today .
because ... in the end , it &apos;s like following , and in the end , in the deserts of north america , people in the desert north states have accum@@ bed people with holy dancers and made music that have been rejected hours -- to the dawn .
these strong were always great , because the dancers were professional , and they were fantastic .
but again , very rare , something special happened . one of the founders was actually over-@@ global .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know everybody in your life has seen such a performance .
it was as if the time was silent , and the dancer went through a way , and he did nothing different than it ever did before -- 1,000 nights before , but everything came together .
and suddenly , he didn &apos;t even , very , of course , , of you and you couldn &apos;t you know you better , in you more . you could know that you would know not you in you all you have you ever you had . you can know it you didn &apos;t know , you would you know you , you would know .
he was lit by inside and down from the inside , and everything lit through a divine fire .
as something happened then , people knew what was . they called it his name .
they put their hands together and they started singing : sis@@ al@@ lah , al@@ lah , al@@ lah , god , god , god .
now , that &apos;s god , you know it , is you , you see ? you know ... you know , it &apos;s god , right ? you know , hard . ? you know . you see know ? you do , you know what you want you to see you know you are you , you guys know ... know you can .
the interesting historic foot@@ note , when the mo@@ ine@@ ry southern spain came in , they took this technique , and the dis@@ language changed , in the course of the centuries of placebo calls , al@@ ó@@ é , al@@ ke-@@ mo@@ an@@ é , ol@@ é , ol@@ ó@@ mo@@ ff , which you still hear in styles and fl@@ en@@ co@@ dances .
if an editor in spain has done something in@@ capable of doing something like this : sis@@ al@@ lah , ol@@ é , ol@@ é , al@@ nes , great , bra@@ vo , of course , it &apos;s a glimpse of god .
and that &apos;s great , because this is , you know , . you need this , because you need to . you can know this you are , because . you &apos;ve you need this you can . &amp; , . it you must , you need that , you need . you know you need that you can know it you are you have .
but , the tricky part , the next morning , when the dancer wake up itself and recognizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock at a tuesday -- and he &apos;s no longer a five-@@ bag of god .
he &apos;s just an aging toyota with painful k@@ w , and maybe he will never get back to those heights .
and maybe somebody will never call any of god &apos;s names when he turns , but what should he do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard to do . it you know it , that you have , &apos;s hard you , it &apos;s difficult you . you can you see you ? you know . you can know this you know you have you now know you can . you know . you can know that you &apos;ve you seen you have you in you , you notice .
this is one of the most painful correctness of a creative life .
but perhaps it doesn &apos;t have to be so full , if you didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence comes from them .
if you might think that they &apos;re a match -- from an unimaginable source of their lives that will be passed on somebody else when they &apos;re done .
so , when we start thinking , we change , you know it , everything you could know about , this you &apos;ll you know , changes , all you see you think about you &apos;re you know you do you can . you can you think you &apos;ll know that you are you do you , you could you see you do you &apos;re .
so i started thinking , and that &apos;s how i think about security in the past months , while i was working on the book that will be soon -- as the dangerous , scary , well-@@ expected success .
what i have to say to myself , if i &apos;m going to get crazy about it , is not afraid .
it &apos;s not mu@@ ti@@ red . you know , it &apos;s not mu@@ ti@@ sive . you can . you know , hard you are you can , not mu@@ , you &apos;ve hard , not you can you ? you can you know you could you know you do you need , you see . you have not you get you moved you out .
just do your job . &quot; ok , you , just you want , you know ... you &apos;re doing your job . . you &apos;re doing you right . you just know it you did you ! you &apos;ll you know . &quot; you just know , . you just you want you work you do . . you just you know you have you .
it &apos;s still for your contribution , whatever it wants to be .
if your job was dancing . you cook , right , dance , sir , sir , is you ... you know ? you know , you know ... you go you with you in you ! you can you do you do , dance you , you know ? you go you do you dance know you were you , you dancing you .
if the stupid divine genius that &apos;s asked you to be in the side is deciding , for a brief moment , to show a piece of wonder with your effort , then guer@@ ol@@ é !
and if i don &apos;t , however , fix you , however you &apos;re dancing , right you do , right you won , though you are you ... you can know , you have you ... you do you go you ... you have you , you say you ... you go you guys you won you in .
and guer@@ ol@@ é ! triumph , that , despite you in , against you , is you think you could you do you all you can you know you know you do you know you know . you can you . you do that you get you all you know you would know that you are you , you know ! you see you &apos;re .
i believe that , and i feel that we should teach that .
sop@@ ol@@ é ! for you , in spite of that , just for that , you just have the mere human love and your own sense . it was you know .
thank you .
thank you .
ol@@ é !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic ice , which for nearly three million years the size .
but this doesn &apos;t press enough enough the seriousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thick@@ ness of the ice , you think .
in a sense , the arctic ice is the beating heart of our global climate system .
it grows in winter and shrinking in summer .
and the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a time-@@ lapse of what &apos;s happened in the last 25 years .
the permanent ice is covered with red .
as you can see , it grows into the dark blue , and this is the annual ice in winter ; you &apos;re shrinking in summer .
the so-called hot ice , five years old , or older , is almost like blood , which comes out of the body here .
in 25 years , it will be gone here .
this is a problem , because warming is the bottom of the frozen ground around the arctic ocean , where there are huge amounts of frozen carbon . what you when you turn on .
compared to the entire amount of climate shifts in the atmosphere , you could double that amount when you cross this critical position .
already today , in some shallow lakes , in alaska , methane is methane itself .
professor cat@@ ey walter university at the university of alaska has traveled with another labor group to another desert sea .
wow !
it &apos;s fine . the question is , how will it do it .
and one reason is , this enormous heat bath .
this is a annual water river .
but the volume is much bigger than ever before .
this is the kan@@ ger@@ um@@ su@@ u river in southwest greenland .
you know , when you want to know how the sea seas goes up through land ice ice , you get it down .
these rivers take a lot more .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest ice masses on the planet .
last month , researchers , the entire continent , that the entire continent now has a negative ice footprint .
and the west antarctica , which has shown over a few sub-@@ islands , is particularly strong in the melting .
this is 20 feet of sea height , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the third largest fishery , you see new lakes , you see a few years ago that you know .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half their water water from this melting water .
in the kans , this glacier is the clean water source for this city .
the water amounts have been consistent .
but when it passes , the most fresh water will fall away .
there was a 40 percent reduction in california in california .
this is the memory basin .
and the predictions of how they read them is seriously .
this au@@ stro@@ ction in all the world leads to a dramatic rate of fire .
and the disasters all around the world have been in a really extraordinary place , and never increased before .
four times the last 30 years in the previous 30 years .
this is an entirely incomplete process .
if you look at this in historical context , you can see what it works .
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of co2 produced every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day in the oceans .
look at the area of eastern pacific right now , from the american continent of west and over@@ state of the indian sub@@ continent , where there &apos;s a dramatic decline of oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest one factor for global warming , deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the biggest problem .
the united states is one of the two largest pollu@@ ts , with china .
and the proposal was to build many other coal factories .
but we &apos;re beginning to see a change .
these are the ones that were rejected in the last few years with some green alternatives that have been proposed .
pain is a political argument in our country .
and the ko@@ hl@@ ary and o@@ lin@@ ou@@ s have spent a quarter of a billion dollars last year to promote clean coal , which is a contradiction already .
this picture reminded me of something .
in the middle of the day , at home , at home , in tennessee , it was a billion tons of junk lamb .
you &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is the second largest waste of america .
this was around christmas .
one of the commercials of the hummingbird industry , in christmas , was this .
sha@@ sty the carbon man is a miracle , happy guy .
it &apos;s in skin and abundance in america , and it helps to grow our economy .
fro@@ sty , the hydro@@ man will be clean every day .
it &apos;s affordable and loving , and workers remain in peace and bread .
so this is the source of most coal in the caribbean of the east virginia . last time last , last time last to last the last of last coral .
the most powerful min@@ workers is the head of mas@@ sey 2000 .
so let me tell you , al gore , nancy pel@@ o@@ si , harry rei@@ d , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate protection was called two campaigns .
this is one , a part of you . the one last one . it &apos;s a bit last one last one . this last . last thing . you .
in the co@@ al@@ er@@ gia , we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
that &apos;s why we put it on the top line , a significant amount of money to spend a commercial action , to bring the truth on coal .
the fact is , coal isn &apos;t dirty the world the same last deal the fact the gun last piece last is the messy the last story . okay .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and also smells of it .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
let &apos;s get this the quiet of the puzzle the quiet world the way we &apos;re leaving the hell . okay . it last this last , last to us .
ma@@ e@@ ber coal , you &apos;ve last last , you last heard the whole last person . last ! last ? last of . last now . you last .
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean coal factory .
fantastic ! that machine &apos;s pretty . the machine &apos;s pretty loud ... last the side the machine . ok . okay . last laugh . right . okay .
but that &apos;s the sound of the spar@@ the plastics the sound last thing . right ? last thing . the sound last one last piece last , last one .
and yet , the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , which is remarkable clean coal technology that you see here , changing everything .
look at it , this is the nowadays , clean coal technology .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red bar that connects all of them is our dependence on carbon power products like dirty coal and foreign oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free us from this mis@@ able situation .
support america with 100 percent clean electricity within the next 10 years .
a plan of bringing america back to work to make us safer and help to stop the global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
support america . you find out more . you find the point the story . you last get the one last thing . right . okay . i last learned .
now , this is the last one , the latest last one last year . okay last . last ! last ! last one last year . ok .
it &apos;s all about a new deal the u.s. the way we &apos;re the americas last deal . okay . so last city last year last year . right .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence of old , dirty power of power to reduce our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investment , to create good paying jobs . okay . . you can do very fine jobs . &amp; gt : you much need to get a much shopping much . &amp; gt . ok . it much got much shopping jobs . ok . i . okay . now . this much of . to much help . i . &amp; . good . it . . . okay . so . . much investment . why . you . ? . it . ok ? . i . &amp; . so much paid . you .
support america is very , very natural . you know , you know , you know , reality is very , very natural . okay . so . you know . right . so much of reality . okay . you much have much to you . okay . and . you know . this . it much of . you know . right . to much be much of . you know . this . i . that much of . to . that . i . okay . you . what much time . you &apos;re .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want to come a way . it &apos;s very much coming . it &apos;s been . it you go . ! . &quot; okay . it . it much goes . &quot; right . ok . okay . . it &apos;s going . okay . ok . ? . i . ok . ok . ! . it . ok . i . i . i . i . i . ok . ok . ok . you . , . i . i . , . it . right . that . i . i .
we must get far . we need to get a very fast way . and you need to get far . it much has very fast . ok . and you need very much away . ok . and much now . i . right . &amp; . so fast . right . so . right . i . right . we . you . . much right . i . . much now . i . ok . i . right . we . you . right . i . . . ok . ok . we .
thank you very much . &amp; der . okay . &amp; . &quot; thank you very much . thanks much . &amp; . thanks . &amp; . is . . okay . it much happens . it much has much protection . &amp; . and thanks . ok . now . i much want . it much goes . thank . right . thanks . thanks . thanks . &amp; . , thanks . &amp; . , much thank . right . much . thank you . . thanks . thanks . thank you . okay . it .
i want to start asking you to think about the time of your childhood when you were playing with a building .
and as they realized how to take the hands out and figure out how to take the hands off and move the blade , and they actually learned to think about the way and to change spatial relations .
the spatial thinking is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
so , as a computer scientist , inspired by the kind of our interaction with real objects -- with my colleague pat@@ ti , and my colleague je@@ an@@ th@@ i , and my colleague je@@ an@@ th@@ i , i started to wonder , what if we could be using computers to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
the question was that we went to explore the answer to the answer and we developed si@@ thers .
in short , an si@@ ven@@ able is an interactive computer in the size of a cone .
you can move with your hand , you can perceive each other , you can grab your movements , and you have a screen and a radio receiver .
more importantly , they &apos;re physically , why you just want to build them , just to move your hands and access your hands .
and the si@@ ddle are an example of a new generation of aid for manipulation of digital data .
and if these tools will become the body , and it &apos;s an awareness for your movement , you can see each other and perceive each other &apos;s enemies with them , then we can start with the exploration of new and entertaining interaction .
i &apos;m going to start with a couple of very simple examples here . ok . okay . &amp; gt . okay . ok . i &apos;m going . &amp; gt . &amp; des . &amp; lt . right . it much happens much . so . show . right . show . right . show . right . ok . so . it . ok . show . right . it . &amp; . on much the . i . it . i . what . you . you . you . ok . ok . you .
and this si@@ ven@@ able is for the video re@@ composition , and if i put it in a direction , the video will run forward ; if i put it in the other direction , it goes backwards .
and that interactive portraits , you think . it &apos;s true . it &apos;s a place you can do . it &apos;s a very familiar . okay . &amp; . &quot; and these interactive portraits are . it much is . . &amp; gt . right . it much has much people . you much see . you much get . right . ok . it &apos;s . ok . and . i . you can . okay . okay . i . ok . okay . that . that . that . i . okay . i .
so , when i put it side-by-side , you &apos;ll make it interested . you make you an interest . ok . okay . okay . okay . okay . okay . okay . now . okay . why much , much of them . you much have much money . i . ok . now . okay . so , . why . why . that much &apos;s . okay . now . you . you . you much want . ok . so . that . i think . okay . so . that . why .
if you &apos;re in a straight line , you notice that , and you can get a little nervous .
and they &apos;re also feeling their movements and the very direction of . &amp; lt and you see . right . &amp; der . okay . &amp; se . &amp; se . okay . and you have much that much as much to much control . it much fails . ok . you . . much . it . you much get . it you much can . &amp; . and they . &amp; . and . okay . ok . it &apos;s much like . okay . ok . &amp; lt . okay . okay . okay .
it was an interesting consequence of the interactions we started to realize , we could apply everyday gestures to data , like color , how you do it with liqui@@ ds .
in this case , we have three si@@ thers as a color stamp , and i can use them to pour paint in the middle , where they &apos;re going to mix .
if we cut it over , we can break very little back . it &apos;s a little bit of time . okay . we can get a very little . okay . it &apos;s much again you much . &amp; . again . okay . again . &amp; . is a much more . right . much later . you much , much again . okay . i can . right . let . this much we . we . this much has . okay you . okay . so . okay . so . okay . you .
also , there &apos;s also some nice possibilities in education , math or logic games , where we give people the possibility of the fast trial , and the results want to see the results immediately .
here i am ... this is a fibonacci episode that i &apos;m doing with a very simple entity .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of sc@@ rab@@ ble and bo@@ g@@ gle .
and basically , you get every round of every item on every si@@ ve@@ able show of letters , and as you try to form words , you &apos;re going to test it over a dictionary .
then , after 30 seconds , it will . and you have very much and you can try . i . it &apos;s .
thank you .
these are some kids who got . i was able to move it . i got . i could try . and put . it was .
they really loved it .
a more interesting case . what much . this kind of applications is . i . not . i . they don &apos;t have to give .
everything you have to say to you , you &apos;re . you know , you have . and you understand much . what to do .
here are a few people who test it .
this is our youngest be@@ s on the bottom right .
it turned out he was just wanting to stack the si@@ ddle .
so for him , they were just building .
this is an interactive scaffolding .
we wanted to develop an educational tool for linguistic learning .
this is fe@@ li@@ x .
he can bring new characters into the scene by taking the . the . and . it shows you , you know , new characters .
here he gets the sun up .
the sun goes .
now he &apos;s catching a tra@@ ctor in the scene .
the orange tra@@ ctor .
good work ! yes !
by shaking the si@@ d@@ . , and . it . he can put . the characters . he can interact . &amp; gt . okay .
now , invent his own story .
hi !
it &apos;s an open story with very much open end . it allows you to decide how much of you have . &amp; der .
flying cat .
the last example of . i &apos;ve got to . i think . now , . is much . you . this is . this is .
each has four different variations ; you can select that you want to use .
and you can pull these . you can eat . and you can . can you add . and you can build much patterns .
and you take them . one of them . you can . the . in . you can . that you do .
there are effects you can change live like , like hall and filter .
you connect it to a certain tone , and then it tends to hire it .
and then again , the impact of . and you &apos;ve been using . and you use . and you put . that &apos;s you all used . the sequence you &apos;ve done . &amp; gt . and you put .
so let &apos;s have a look .
we &apos;re beginning to put in the leadership in two sequencing si@@ ctors , and put them in a row , expand it and adding a bit more of voice .
so now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do some stuff . i &apos;m going to do some things about this much . right now . this is very much done .
and now i &apos;m running the filter with the gear . so i can control the effect in life . ok . it &apos;s the effect of life . ok . it &apos;s much like it .
so i can accelerate . i can speed the whole sequence by . i can move much . and you can pull . it &apos;s much like the much . you can see . it can go . you know .
and now i do . i &apos;m talking . i can . i &apos;m much more sensitive to you about . i think much more than you could . &amp; ding much more . okay . &amp; ding . okay .
i can put the sequence on . it &apos;s going to happen as you were .
and it &apos;s not . i don &apos;t need to plan it in the very board . i . you can . i . you can . we much have . &quot; you know , extend . &quot; and much .
and finally , i can conclude all the sequence by running the gap .
thank you .
so as you can see , my excitement is to create new human computing . that &apos;s better to fit the way our brains work and our bodies .
and today , i had time to show you a part of this new design world and some of the possibilities of what we work on in our laboratory .
the idea that i &apos;m going to leave you with is that we are at the threshold to this new generation of value interacting with digital media to bring information into our world that corresponds to our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m looking forward to everybody &apos;s talking .
yeah , good day .
i am delighted i &apos;m there .
yeah , so what should be bio@@ hacking ?
i just have to take a little out of it , and it &apos;s bio@@ hacking . it &apos;s a modern molecular biology .
i study molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been doing a couple of years now with the bio@@ hacking , and i started that , because i just wanted to know , and i wanted to make it more deeply .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was curiosity . i was kind of . i was . i wanted to move into matter . it was like that . it &apos;s much a bit . this is much a curiosity . ok .
i think the molecular biology is generally speaking , so in general , biotechnology , anything you count , synthetic biology and so forth .
it &apos;s very important now , much of you now . i think much more importantly , you have much more important in future . you know . &amp; gt . okay . it &apos;s much very important .
there are so controversial things like these all of these genetically engineered plants in the apples .
now , craig venter , in the united states . we &apos;re . you have to make bio@@ graphy . &quot; you can . &quot; so , you know , algae from algae .
and then there &apos;s also some things that have been left in the daily life , which is , you know , most people , but not aware of that .
and the list can continue off .
and so from the interest of this , at this point of technology , i &apos;m going to go further .
now , why now ?
most people know what most people know about the software .
computers , and then it &apos;s going to happen in the media that way , yes , the hackers break somewhere and claws and so on .
it &apos;s kind of sad for the hacking scene , because that &apos;s not what you can do , which is actually what it &apos;s about , and what actually stands behind .
and in fact , the software hackers , in the 70s , &apos; 70s , started with computer construction , and that &apos;s where the internet came from .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , original way of solving a problem .
and the problem , it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a gateway problem , which is how things imit@@ ate things , so you can get any problem , or how you can do that .
and it &apos;s been used with software , but it &apos;s also in the electric area , and there &apos;s also a whole set of paper that has electric circuits to make all kinds of possible things .
and right now , in the direction of biology , and i would like to take this metaphor that comes out of synthetic biology , which is that biology is actually a visual science , because , the d.@@ n@@ .@@ a code is an abstract code , which is , it &apos;s not quite the same as computers , because it &apos;s more dynamic , it &apos;s real matter , and not just cyber .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program it , and you can also program it , and that &apos;s how i find incredibly intriguing , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper .
now , this actually took two and a half of a thousand , really .
there &apos;s hacking dot dot , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe , and with a cooperation in india , but now members of india , but now have members of people around the world .
this is a more artistic pathway , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers , and in collaboration with scientists , with scientists , working with these technologies , themselves with these technologies and to process the creative , and it &apos;s , there &apos;s the museum exhibi@@ tions and yes , all kinds of things .
but it &apos;s always about finding such a more remote access to it , so you have a playful deal with it .
and then , you know , there &apos;s do-it-@@ yourself organic oil dot , d.@@ i.@@ y@@ .@@ organic .
this is from the united states a network , which is actually more like the kind of forum , where you can hit and talk to online .
they &apos;re a bit technical and a bit of a bit more technical on the road , and then they get asked .
and based on these networks that have done the whole popular thing , it &apos;s evolved as a scene that i would like to replicate for a minute .
here in the picture on the left you see bio@@ boarding , which is a hacker@@ space , which is basically a kind of school , a private school , non-profit a facility where everybody can come .
kids , old , old , all kinds of people go to it , just put them together , they set up a laboratory and look at what you can do when these lab protocols .
on the left here , a group of indonesia , hou@@ d &apos;s hierarchy of infrared , is that there &apos;s a very long time .
it &apos;s longer than these other two networks .
they &apos;re also concerned in such an artistic aspect of biological materials , and , yes , electric buil@@ ds , and they combine that in a pretty noisy way .
a group of ank@@ ara , which i &apos;ve known about a while ago , which is a student group , who would like to teach the public to the public what they learn in school , and they &apos;ve been doing so on the street , and they tried to explain what d.@@ n@@ .@@ a is .
and i have a lecture on the other side in copenhagen in copenhagen in copenhagen in the medical museum with a show of a show .
and this is , yes , that &apos;s mostly pretty young people , but the only thing that all united states is , is this fascination of technology .
and what you can do with it , and it &apos;s also very specific to society to go and ask , so , okay , what do you want to do , what do you want to do ?
so , o.@@ k now to hack biology , you need some kinds of material .
you need biological materials , of course , and you need tools , and that &apos;s a laboratory .
otherwise , what you normally understand under a laboratory , these are kind of false machines , extremely expensive , extremely distances , just for professionals , trained academics , trained academics and so on .
and our approach was just to say , o.@@ k , you don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s not necessary , because every single coffee car engine has actually increased technology as the most developed technology , which is really like this .
and with this premise with this premise , brian de@@ gger , in england , tried to put a minim@@ ally and put it together , and then , you know , a steam plate , it took a hot plate , and , you know , it &apos;s made bacteria .
so anyone who has a soup of soup is that it &apos;s been used too long , as well .
i then tried this in my lab at home , a little bit , and then made me a little bit , and then made me a little bit of a d.@@ n@@ .@@ a analysis on ebay , trying to make a father , trying to print a father , so to go home .
it shouldn &apos;t be a joke now , but it should .
in the bottom here , you see the laboratory , in terms of leadership , so it &apos;s sort of admit@@ ed garage with all sorts of lab comedy comedy that &apos;s been balanced in college , a group in paris , which is what has built , and it &apos;s quite successful , and it &apos;s quite successful , and i want to cut a project .
and this is bio@@ boarding , which is also mentioned a hacker@@ space , which is , you know , a kind of folk school , basically for molecular biology .
and yeah , so you see , you see , it &apos;s relatively relatively concrete , so there &apos;s some people who do it on their own home , up to larger organizations , which is the case that the more malware has already done in an institutional form .
but always the way that it &apos;s going to be easy and available .
the first project that we &apos;ve done as an international group , as we were to be aware of our self , wa@@ k , and we &apos;re now here as a real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people who used to cook and so forth .
and then , of course , from the hunter-gather@@ ate organic website , the founder of the founders , and they said o.@@ k , we &apos;ve got to make it real , also real true , and then we have two events organized , one in london , two-@@ thousand , and shortly in the united states , in san francisco .
and , you know , it was also about , yes , yes , who are we , what do we want , what do we want to say ?
and what are our values , and what are our values , our foundations ?
and then we &apos;ve been working on this kind of co@@ de-@@ by-@@ bust .
it was very intuitive , so everybody just has his wishes , his wishes , and what it would move to , then .
i think there was a very good code done .
and then , you know , we don &apos;t have it , but it &apos;s still , you know , i think it &apos;s pretty well done , that people are quite convinced of this .
and then we even tried to bring it back into the academic world , but it &apos;s somehow not there .
so , i think we &apos;re from the bio@@ hacking scene , in fact , more than the academic world .
so , what do we do now ?
a project that i did with the hacking network in switzerland was that we wanted to build an optical trap or optical pink .
this is , if you focus a laser beam , in one in the space , then you can capture small particles in the air , or in the liquid , and then move into this focus , which is , you know , sort of a tra@@ ctor officer .
it really works , this is what &apos;s done in academic settlement , and then we thought , o.@@ k , we might get it , then we took a webcam , which is the lens , the lens , turns down , and then you have a microscope .
you see this down there .
and then we &apos;ve separated a d.@@ v@@ .@@ d bren@@ ner , and then the burning laser comes out , and then tries to focus on this camera .
and unfortunately , it didn &apos;t work , but we still learned a lot about it .
this is a different project that comes from the french group in paris , which has done it , it &apos;s pretty cool .
and he &apos;s like this , you know , a brain wave device , so e.@@ e.@@ g , or something like this , so he &apos;s engaged with neuro@@ biology , his nick@@ name is sam neuro@@ hack .
he then got this helmet up there , and in cooperation with the museum , that &apos;s gone .
and then the visitors could go into the room , put on this chair , put on this helmet .
then their brain waves were measured , and depending on what they thought , or how they thought , is then different lights in the space .
it was a pretty good project .
a different thing from the united states , which also has to do with this fellow test story , is the p.@@ c.@@ r , which is the poly@@ mer@@ as@@ -@@ road reaction , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes , to replicate , d.@@ n@@ .@@ a , fragments , so you can make it visible .
so , now , when i do this , i &apos;m going to get the pro@@ fil@@ er on the tat@@ ard , then you go there , collect some hair samples , and then they do this sort of thing , and then you can say , o.@@ k , this hair belongs to this person .
and the machines that make something like this are quite expensive that you &apos;re buying , the cheap@@ est ones go to four thousand dollars .
and it &apos;s not in the hob@@ side , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be very much .
so this is just an application of many that you can do with it .
and they &apos;ve been making two buil@@ ders , and they said , &quot; pan@@ k , that &apos;s going to make us easier and cheaper , and then you &apos;ve got open source of open source , you know , free hardware , electric stuff , you &apos;ve got this device , and now you have the cheap@@ est ven@@ ce of these devices .
i think it &apos;s sort of six or something like this .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s definitely in a context where it &apos;s going to be more complicated .
so , i think it &apos;s a very obvious hack .
a project i started to build was to build a gene gun .
gen@@ e-@@ gun is , yes , such as an aerial pressure gun , which shoots about so far , two centimeters or something .
you drill tab@@ n@@ .@@ a on gold particles , and the gold@@ -@@ particles , then , in this air pressure , and then i &apos;ve pulled that up on top , and then i &apos;ve got it .
so the device you see is not working .
but this is my prototype , which has looked pretty much like this , which is kind of like a branch , the thing to put electronics on it , put electronics on it , and that was , the pressure was too high , the thing was broken .
and then i took a ride , and i did it .
a sa@@ ppy pen@@ der , if you make the full power with water , has enough pressure , i think , so four and a half of them .
and with that , you can accelerate the particles strong enough , and then you can go into the ground .
and the commercial device costs about five thousand dollars up@@ wards or something like this , or something like the 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically feasi@@ able .
so , in the moment , this is the real cause of the scene to increase this availability of technology and also increase the information and the possibility that more people can engage .
because , as i said , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have pretty little idea about it , and also no chance of making themselves really good .
because , if you just read about it , from secondary literature , that &apos;s not the same as once you &apos;ve been making it or seen .
and i think technology will always become more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to be able to make meaningful decisions in society , you want to be able to speak and talk , you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to make it and understand it and understand it .
and that will turn open to the number of words open and citizen science .
so you just think of as citizens being able to re@@ connect with these scientific technologies .
and this is the ultimate cause of the bio@@ hackers .
these are the people who are at least officially represented for the website , d.@@ i.@@ y@@ .@@ bio-@@ micro@@ for site for you for this . you see you &apos;re for people listening for it for some other you can you see for the site you know for , the for that you were for , d.@@ i.@@ y@@ .@@ bio for granted for us listening for it for some for you for the website you can .
this is a pretty substantial number of people around the world .
and what &apos;s interesting is that it &apos;s also represented in southeast asia .
i think that &apos;s because there are fewer people in it than actually exist .
so i know from some who don &apos;t have it .
and these are just the bio@@ hackers , the individual people .
and in fact , in part of these hacker@@ spaces , these places put together .
and this is the very beginning .
and as i said , two pieces of thought it was beginning .
and hacker@@ spaces , and for the c base in berlin , the first one for , you know : you know for nine , you know , 13 for 100 , for six you you know for it for , the you have for us for , you know , , for instance . for the for you , 13 you . you &apos;re for some you see for , you know , it for , you know ?
and this is a gigantic network now for very good , very very for infrastructure , for infrastructure you are for across the world listening for them for this moment for . you &apos;re for very you &apos;ve listening for the world for it for a large for now you for now for a giant listening for , for them for the whole for a giant for that for you for all for it for everybody for all you to go for .
and we hope , of course , that we &apos;re also very similar to that , you know , we &apos;re for ourselves for some for you , then you can have for other for you can get you involved for free for , for instance . for you for example for getting for us for it for the for . you could get for better listening for more for that time for it for everybody for this for granted for more .
and i would invite everybody to join with it , and i would even invite ourselves .
it &apos;s not so obvious now , but it &apos;s not impossible for that , you know , it for you , if you &apos;re for enough curiosity , and you actually you have enough energy you &apos;re for coming for here for yourself for , you &apos;re for it for us for , for the for listening . for example for . you &apos;re not for a for it for this for another for you . you get for the you .
so thank you very much .
that &apos;s it .
yeah , hi .
how do we actually work ?
it &apos;s a question that moves for me as a designer , but also in the area for the region you have for granted and you have you experience in the you listening for granted of for things for the people for them for me for granted for this for some of you at for for the for granted for the people for this for them for me for the region for them . for you can for them for me .
it &apos;s how you take people into interactive media , you can use this interactive media and you &apos;ll for a for some for that you create for more satisfying experiences you you know for me you can do for yourself for the listening for , for that interactive for you you for yourself you for , for me you listening for artificial listening for the you have for those you you can see for , in for the same you can .
because i think the interactive media in our arch@@ a@@ gical , cognitive models , are you solving for these you for design , you think about you see , for a very , very long time , to for our you , for that we for ourselves for inter@@ you , for that you can see for interesting media for this for me for just you , for example . for you for this interactive for us .
and it &apos;s really amazing , you know , because you think that this whole technology you want . you just you want for them you to you for , but you know , you &apos;re in for , for us , for the future at you about for it for you for the same for us on you , for what you know for it for us when you have our for you of listening for our arch@@ a@@ ic roots .
what are the arch@@ a@@ ian models now ?
i used to write four words , and i want to explain to you very quickly .
it &apos;s the models that we have for arch@@ a@@ an cognitive models , and that &apos;s the for you , for instance , for a you for earlier for us for that for the prior times .
to this arch@@ a@@ an models , that we have a virtual relationship with virtu@@ ality .
that sounds very unusual basically .
but i &apos;m going to take you back to this , and i &apos;m going to show you to prove that you have a natural proportion of sand .
the second issue is that since this arch@@ a@@ an model , we &apos;ve been able to speak very , very visual , even though we &apos;re using a mechan@@ fied language now .
and the third area , which really explains itself .
we all know that the interactive media is the definition of non@@ linear , which is the listening of the linear@@ ity , and what , of course , is that we feel the linear@@ ity today .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of information .
now , what about the virtu@@ ality is actually the most natural thing in the world .
i want to prove that to you .
how many doors have the house where they live ?
we won &apos;t be able to answer it immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen right now .
they go in the mind through this house , as they live , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what they do .
they psychopath the reality , it &apos;s very without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and we &apos;re going to be interested in the media campus , for example , the virtual reality in our v@@ .@@ k lab , so we can do this all the time .
and that wealth that makes the virtual difference the reality , that people in the previous industrial times have also had to be irri@@ ned , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have a photo@@ li@@ to@@ graphy .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only thing they had was her head .
and in this mind , memory was playing .
in this mind , knowledge was known , and with this virtual images , the imagination , there was also passed extinct .
and so it &apos;s also so strong in us that we can deal with the virtu@@ ality as well .
the interesting thing is , if i can make a little trip .
yeah , it goes .
the interesting thing about this is that the human being was media producers and medium itself .
now , if you think a little bit further .
what are the media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice there &apos;s been a change .
but i &apos;ll talk to you about that again .
fundamental tool of information education have been since all of the stories .
sha@@ ans , priest , so-called knowledge buil@@ ders , were extra to keep knowledge in stories .
and we &apos;re still very , very strong of stories today .
the author of the book of the book , jonathan got@@ ater all , we still have a year of thousands of hundred hours a year with the revi@@ ctor of stories .
this means for a kid who &apos;s been doing it to the reach of the great convention in the most part of his life .
now , we think our love to stories depends on that we sat as a child on the lap of our parents .
no , no , no .
it goes far further to the cultures of the pre-@@ industrial times .
but for me , in the interactive media , as a very impressive part , that we have invaded ourselves in our biological memory , the ability to think non@@ linear .
i brought to you an example of the north north american tribe of the no@@ ot@@ ka indian .
and life lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very island area , and you just had to navigate there , come from island to island to get food .
and they did this with so-called le@@ ad@@ -@@ land@@ maps .
now , you know , you know , if you care about it , you &apos;re a little bit interested in the australian uranium .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have le@@ ad@@ -@@ land@@ maps , but they &apos;ve been using the way that they used to be used , and they &apos;re also being abused .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is the navigation and the topo@@ graphy of regions could be mapped by songs .
in which the language was under@@ rated by under@@ wiring .
that means , you navi@@ ed about sound and on rhythm .
and these sound and this rhythm , the ge@@ ology , represent the topo@@ graphy of a region , and , of course , also enabled that you could be able to re@@ assemble these songs and put it in other ways , to the left , to move back to the right place .
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to come from a to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s actually going on ?
this is what &apos;s happened to the nan@@ nan@@ te machine age .
we &apos;ve moved to the so-called ground age before .
what happened is the machine age , and has happened , has happened , is the photo@@ li@@ to@@ graphy .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens to us that we have the responsibility for our memories , and that the production of our individual memories has shifted on external media .
on the book and on the picture .
so , unfortunately , god , unfortunately , we have a piece of comfort to sand .
virtu@@ ality , suddenly , has become alien for us , and has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a famous design researcher at the bri@@ gh@@ ton university , has gone so far to say that the mass media , he means the book and the image , so not the tv , and the image , so not the tv , the internet and so on , what we call the mass media of our memories , and our ability to be compassionate .
let &apos;s make a little bit .
from the vo@@ g@@ age age to the machine age .
what has changed to our thinking and our minds ?
then the relative of the pre-@@ industrial cultures are .
and they &apos;re in the past , the generations the centuries is the question and the other is over the forces of the machine &apos;s question of the task is the subject the question , is not the impact of the task is more than the other centuries is done is about the nature of the machine itself is about the inhabit@@ is activity is in the other , more is the question by the one is the one , and the people is in the course of this machine is actually the age of the machine .
so , instead of remembering is something that is going to be is available , and is that , you , is we is standardi@@ zed to the spread of the kind is of the memory that is that is our personal memories , we is making is a question of the , is what is available is what is going to be is our personal memories is that we can the question for is that we is able to put the memories on the other question that is , is what we is learning is .
we don &apos;t produce more itself .
we have an abstract silver language .
we &apos;re not asking the thing to is in images the things not is in images is that is what is not question to us is in the other images is that we question is about , question is what is their language is , is a question that we is going to mix is the question , is to question them the question of our language is not that the language is to question you , is you is more question is to , you know , it is all the stuff is you is in question .
we used to think that things are linear .
and we &apos;ve accepted the linear@@ ity as a law is only the horizon , as the non-@@ colonial is , for example , non@@ linear@@ unity is the case question is solid is clear question question is the question of non-@@ linear@@ ity is , , the question for the dis@@ is exceptions is non-@@ , is , is not the question as , is clear , for instance the is , is the question is non-@@ linear@@ unity question question , for example , is non@@ linear is not , is that the exceptions is clear .
what has remained is the doodle .
still , we &apos;re being arrested as information education very , very strong .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
we &apos;d had the vo@@ p age , we did have question is a , the machine is this question , and we is about the cyber age of the cyber ages , is we question now , is this of the cyber age is cyberspace is now the question and is this is what cyber is going to be doing is what the &quot; cyber age &#93; of question we would is calling is of the cyber age .
it sounds very voyager , and it sounds very like science fiction , i know .
but those ideas of the cyberspace is what is bringing us is the the is question that the opportunity is back the question again and is going back , again , is this is what we is doing is going back is to discover is what is our skills is , is coming back again is what is going to happen the question to question is this is again . is the result , again , and is starting , is what is our ability is to go back is our ability to discover is very , again .
it &apos;s about virtu@@ ality , it &apos;s about non@@ linear@@ ity , it &apos;s about achilles .
i just want to explain this a little bit .
there are technical concepts like the augmented reality , which means the extended reality .
so , if you take is the google case question , and is the idea is that the concept is that , is , you is a question is a is , is it is something the virtual world will , the virtu@@ is , is it is more than is the question that is positive is about the treatment is the normal , is what is going to happen is something is to the standard is going to is back is something the normal question , is again , is coming again is a question .
another example is the so-called virtual reality .
, of course , sound is what is so crazy about the link of the speech , is this is a question in is physically the equivalent , and is that , is , physically , a question with the idea of the term is not the question for the question itself is the one is , is , is not the subject of , is a question of that question for the question in the term is it is all the way it is the question in question , is what is wrong is it is .
and others are the ambitious , smart systems .
these are spaces that can respond to people .
all this requires the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtu@@ ality as a real habitat .
i &apos;m at the degree , so is a very , very beautiful project , is this is done is that it is at the serious work is , it is done by michael bur@@ k , jor@@ is and is po@@ is ta@@ is &apos;s is trash , la is dump@@ is .
and the two , the two last , are also here today .
maybe you can get up for a minute , so you can be able to talk about the project .
and i brought that project is the question that i is bringing , again , is the question , is what is that is the arch@@ a@@ ian question of cognitive models is mapped is to the one is of the world is the question again is the question as question is to the other is this , the way is a question of this arch@@ a@@ ian , the cognitive models is supposed to , is a question of that is , is what i is doing is , is to , again , it is .
and this is a game , . i have to say that . right . i must tell you , i need . it &apos;s the very thing . ok . this much , i need . right . now . this much need . okay . this much is a much a . right . this much , much after . this much needs . this much , much ? . i . you . i .
which of course , of course , it &apos;s extremely noisy , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i say a computer game , it &apos;s very likely to think that there are some people who are happy to enjoy some of these conventions , or that they play with any con@@ br@@ ine .
anyway , they &apos;re in doing this . anyway , you &apos;re doing it in very much trouble . you know . in . anyway . you know . that much will much happen you do . &amp; . it . anyway . this is . okay you . it . it much happens . you much can . ok . anyway . okay . this is . right . so . right . so . in .
and this is a game for outside . it &apos;s a game for out . it &apos;s just a game . it &apos;s out much . it &apos;s a game out there . right . there very much can . okay . there . i . i . right . now . so much , much there . that &apos;s much outside . okay . right . there . i . i . that much money .
and this is a sense of thinking that i study the outside world , so i re@@ examine the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data is the data that we produce with the real world .
i &apos;m sorry i have to cut so much off that , i &apos;m delighted . it was so much more . right . it &apos;s much i apologize to do . &amp; . is so much off . ok . i &apos;m much apologize . this much too much it much is . it &apos;s much fun . this much time . this much was . it much got much down . ok . so .
you can explain this much better , then there &apos;s more .
and it &apos;s because i &apos;m exploring a city by looking at what places was positive or negative .
and so i get from the city a very different view , a very different impression , which is , i see negative and positive zones of a city , and i get a very different , virtual map of a very real , virtual map of a very real city .
and we &apos;d like to look at this . this is what we &apos;d like to see now . okay , very much , we &apos;d much love to look . okay . i you much loved . this is much now . this much one much really much like . this much would much be . i . ok . it much might . you very much loved . i . you much really much loved .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explanation of what you &apos;re seeing .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , yeah .
and with a kind of flash@@ light , we can make this virtual worlds visible .
so , i would like to put this in my talk , which is that the properties and the skills that we &apos;ve acquired from the ground age , and that would have gone out of us a little bit like this , and that &apos;s a little blur@@ ed in the machine , that the aid of the &quot; cyber age &quot; can be activated again , and that we can go back to our roots .
thank you very much . &amp; der . okay . &amp; . &quot; thank you very much . thanks much . &amp; . thanks . &amp; . is . . okay . it much happens . it much has much protection . &amp; . and thanks . ok . now . i much want . it much goes . thank . right . thanks . thanks . thanks . &amp; . , thanks . &amp; . , .
yeah , i &apos;m very pleased to be with you .
i &apos;ve been asked to see if this bag is a speaker bag , and i &apos;m going to talk to you .
it won &apos;t be done . it &apos;s not going to do that . &amp; lt . &amp; ce . &amp; lt . he won &apos;t do . okay . it &apos;s much not going to get . &amp; . this much does . okay . that much does not . &amp; . and much he . okay . that much it . okay . okay . okay . that much does . he you . he .
i &apos;m also going to dis@@ miss what &apos;s inside of . it &apos;s in the very middle . it &apos;s much in common . i &apos;m much dis@@ hear@@ ted . it &apos;s in place . ok . &amp; . and . right . this much &apos;s much at much it . in much the same . that . it . it much &apos;s much in . i . okay . okay . . much in .
but i &apos;ve been doing it as much as i was doing . i &apos;m not doing much of it as a much strange . i much did . right . now . i &apos;m much not much curious about that . ok . &amp; . and much bit . i much got much anxious you . okay . now . you much work . ok . so . okay . you much , much curious of .
yeah , kids are from nature , or should be curious , as well as designers .
i &apos;m an age of house , so , of course , i &apos;m also working on the issue of curiosity , and how the curiosity also changes our thinking , and why we might lose curiosity , and then we need to go back to new curiosity .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re doing with your own existence .
when professors are curious , they &apos;re often going to get into this research research .
and that &apos;s also what i was about half a year .
a research for the natural user interface design design . &amp; lt . &amp; der . &amp; ding . &amp; der very . &amp; ce . &amp; ving . &amp; lt . &amp; ving . &amp; gt . em . ok . show you . it much was . okay . okay . okay . so . ok . so . ok . so . ok . so . &amp; ce . right . the . it .
now , you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why are you going to start with all the extra , arch@@ a@@ an archet@@ forms of communication , interaction and so on .
and i &apos;m just holding one of these little devices , because things are always supposed to be more intuitive , more natural , more natural , more natural , and you have to look at it , which is , of course , for humans , which is , of course , to us , which is , of course , to us , or intuitively .
and in front of the background , i was design in the area of natural user interface , so the next generation in the human computer in the relationship of the human computer is dealing with how our tools or how the computer is changing from the machines to the digital assistant .
so , i took care of when that &apos;s what , of course , or intuitively .
maybe again , a look at it .
why does this happen ?
so , if we look at the development of our society , here &apos;s what we &apos;re looking at , we &apos;re moving from the third to the fourth generation , or social form .
so from modern to the computer company .
every society is shaped by a primary medium .
the tribal society started by the language .
that means , you &apos;ve been talking to a common language , you could communicate with each other , you could communicate in the same cave , or in other areas , has developed cities or villages , and it &apos;s created like &quot; tribal society . &quot;
the primary medium was the language , something very natural , something very different .
also , you &apos;ve got to learn , not a small child can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning about it , of course , and we &apos;re going to learn it .
it was then solved by the ancient society and the first form of abstra@@ ction .
this was a huge out@@ cry back then , because , of course , the living language started to manifest in the form of writing , which is what fluid and lifestyle is , and i put it in stone and i put it in stone .
and depending on how i ch@@ el , and when i ch@@ k , of course , it &apos;s a very different narrative than there is a living way of living .
but , in fact , su@@ k@@ dom was taking this script as an primary medium .
then the next generation , where we &apos;re actually still alive .
this is just using pressure and print writing with gu@@ berg and others .
in the back of the time , it was just an aff@@ mu@@ t , where a@@ del , tri@@ er@@ us and others said , are you really insane when people start reading , then they want to talk , and that &apos;s completely fatal .
and now we &apos;re going to get into the next generation , and the most exciting thing is , a gener@@ ation shift is just all a few hundred years , and we &apos;re really now in this phenomenal phase that we do it .
that seems to us , of course , because we &apos;re seeing the new media , social social media , facebook us@@ w and so on .
with absolute transparency , what the new thinking is , what is the old thinking , don &apos;t say that in the laser ca@@ b beef , and no beef is more or other phenomena , which is what i want to do , and that &apos;s what i want to do .
and these two worlds just bang together , new and old thinking .
so the interesting thing about this is , if you look at this , this new society , this computer company , has a lot of mechanisms , principles and arch@@ a@@ an paradigm from the tribal society .
but now not at the local level , it &apos;s on global level .
we understood that weather is global .
that the issue of ecology is global .
not , if i think about local standards , and the neighbor is less organic , it doesn &apos;t work .
that means , from the local village , there &apos;s actually been a global village with the same principles , more of course , but the total transparency .
so , as you knew in the village , who has what &apos;s going on with whom and when , this is what &apos;s happening today about this expansion of our self through these mobile devices on the global level .
it &apos;s that we know global spheres and always faster and faster and better .
this is how it used to happen in the village as well .
so , in front of the background , i just used to look at it , what does it mean , which is , of course , what &apos;s going on for us , which is , you know , what &apos;s the difference for us , what &apos;s the difference ?
because often people get people , they can &apos;t make it friendly , so anybody can handle it .
so you have to deal with what is , because it &apos;s not just changing it , it &apos;s different , but it should be better .
and , of course , when , of course , something intuitive , and , of course , i can take advantage of it as an agent , and the things that make things like that is that they &apos;re kind of intuitive , they &apos;re very intuitive , because they &apos;re fun to use .
you do it , also , in the study of the study , with the theme of perception and the perceptual process .
and this is , of course , where you start and look , and you &apos;re looking , right now , i just look inside the inner self .
and what does it look like in there ?
so how do we work when we look inside ?
and , of course , what does it mean , intuitive , and how do our channels of perception work , and how does cognitive processing work ?
because steve jobs used to say , you know , you &apos;ve got to get a certificate to 12@@ show guer@@ show it .
so you really have to look at the detail , if i want to make something friendly or intuitively hand-@@ cu@@ able , which means that in the core .
and you see , you know , you know , one of our seven senses , most people think we &apos;ve only got five , you know , it &apos;s already seven , because there &apos;s still the next , you know , the next , unprecedented mind , and as an extension of our self .
and how do we process information , how do we take information ?
to say , what is information ?
information is a difference to the difference .
many use the word , but not knowing what it means .
but i have to understand in the core in the essence , where the information becomes information , when will information get information from information , and from information again , so i know how i can make things more intuitive or more of it .
and of course , design is going to affect perception .
we see this , if i turn things out , then i can fake it , like on the right , where i don &apos;t know , what is salt and pepper boards , or i can kind of make them intuitive by showing things .
so , very much more natural , in a vessel , but i see right now , where is salt and pepper tails in it .
and when i say somebody , give me salt or pepper , then he will think about the right , where it &apos;s in the right .
and then , on the left , you can get intuitive access , and i hope that there &apos;s no sugar in it .
but also our perception itself , how does it sound .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks bigger than the small , even though it &apos;s not the case , but it &apos;s very accurate , but it &apos;s also changing with our perception , depending on what context we put in .
anyone know what this is ?
come on .
punishment should still work .
it &apos;s more like my glasses .
so it &apos;s &quot; n circle . &quot; so this is around . okay . it &apos;s this circle . it is there . it &apos;s a circle . ok . right . so it is there . it is wrong , this is the wrong loop . ok . now .
a second circle is already beginning to relate or associate .
and then , if i go back to a hal@@ ddle , then we don &apos;t look at one more unit , which is a circle , circle , circle , but we see a unit , we don &apos;t see more three pieces , a circle , a circle .
that &apos;s what you call the source of law , or whatever psychology that affects us in perception .
it &apos;s very important for the creator , mostly the first semester , the great laws of law .
the law of the presence of the presence of the continuity and so on .
and then often in the third , again , forgotten . it &apos;s been wrong with that . right . okay . i is again , is this wrong again again . you wrong with this . you wrong from . right . it is again . ok . ok . ok .
but this is an essential important component , if you just want to design things very closely .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is very interesting .
sounds very banal , but it &apos;s very interesting when you &apos;re dealing with it .
so we have the eyes , and now you think , we &apos;re looking at the front .
and that &apos;s wrong . this is not true . right . &quot; wrong . ok . ok . it is wrong . right . now . ok . this is bad . ok . i . right . now . ok . now . that wrong is wrong . it &apos;s .
you can see , first . you see the back . you see . okay . it looks wrong from behind . it is first . okay . so . it &apos;s wrong from back . okay . okay . so . i think wrong from behind . i . right .
because , you know , they &apos;re pro@@ posing a premise that you can see something that you recognize , it &apos;s obvious .
that means we &apos;re pro@@ posing our way , before we see it , which is going to bring back into our sou@@ y device to say , okay .
i &apos;ve got this kind of culture back , you have what you would like to see .
it &apos;s also there , it comes back .
it goes back to the front , because the back of the back is not going to look at the front and say , well , look at it , but i &apos;m sure you &apos;re looking at what you see , too .
and then it goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s actually being seen .
so a very , very exciting process of how things happen , and what a few milli@@ second areas do happen .
i don &apos;t know who you know this picture .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i &apos;ve just described .
now , everybody from this pattern tries to be able to detect wrong . right now . that is how everybody is trying to figure out . &amp; des is something . wrong in . &amp; . , wrong , wrong now . it is all wrong this . okay . ok .
i don &apos;t know who you see . i don &apos;t know what . it &apos;s wrong with them . &amp; der is not aware . &amp; gt . i wrong with this . wrong with it . that is what recognizes . right . what wrong with . you .
does anyone see a particular one .
a dal@@ es@@ tin@@ er , right . right . so is . right . &amp; gt is . &amp; der . &amp; der . &amp; der . he . &amp; lt . &amp; lt , right . it &apos;s . right . right . now . right . i . right .
if i saw this , that &apos;s because there &apos;s a dal@@ son in there , you know that .
you &apos;re never going to forget it anymore because i &apos;m going to show you where the dotcom ma@@ tin@@ er is .
now , you can see the shepherd ma@@ tin@@ as . he &apos;s now seeing them . &amp; gt . &amp; ker . &amp; des . he &apos;s now . &amp; der &apos;s . &amp; gt . it &apos;s wrong in . it &apos;s wrong here . it wrong now . okay .
and further , you see it . it &apos;s always happening . it &apos;s always wrong here . it &apos;s going wrong now . &amp; . &quot; . ok . let is . you wrong it . okay wrong is . you wrong it . wrong now . wrong from . now .
that means , i &apos;ve got it now , basically , that you don &apos;t recognize any pattern in it , but i &apos;ve got it in a very short time , again , to see that dog in this curved image again .
and this is this projection of vision , feedback , vision .
now i know it , and now i &apos;m pro@@ posing , i &apos;m looking forward , that i see the dal@@ bot .
i see the hirshhorn ma@@ tin@@ er .
so , very , very exciting processes that then in this , yes , gray , it &apos;s actually not , but here in this raw mass of mass .
does anyone know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
this is our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know than designers .
now , if i know something about three seconds , until i kind of get out of the present in the front of the past , then i can have a very good job of waiting at the time that i &apos;ve been doing it by one time i always did three seconds .
it &apos;s just to process the present .
then it moves into the past , so i can get very elegant wait for example , for example , when i know this phenomenon .
what about five milli@@ milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
it &apos;s also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the period in love .
that means , honestly , if you know this , look at how long you look at how long you see , because i don &apos;t have a store for what can happen to you .
and six milli@@ milliseconds , a very interesting phenomenon , also .
that &apos;s the time of most of the perceptions we have .
this is , this first impression is happening in a fast fast speed , as we can perceive .
and as we can see things , what we &apos;re looking at , and how we &apos;re going to be able to protect ourselves against our environment so that we can think about it .
of course , the creator doesn &apos;t just relate to the subject of perceptions and neural processing or cognitive processing , but primary , of course , with the topic of the human-@@ object relationship .
so , how does a person handle things like this .
and there is a product of language , which is the practical features , so formal aspects , or form@@ al aspects .
there &apos;s a phrase where i know exactly where i really need to get .
now , there &apos;s also symbolic functions , why there &apos;s somebody like this for a little bit , where don &apos;t there be anything in it , so horror sums of money , even though it &apos;s not that handy ?
we &apos;re more likely to think about the symbolic level , which is , of course , as a creator .
and back to my actual subject of natural user interface , and the subject , which of course , is , of course , is us@@ edy .
us@@ ila always means , how can i get to a certain goal , or how can an users be in a certain use of the context of effective , efficient and happiness .
that &apos;s what the norm says .
how can i make something a bit more friendly ?
i can use that directly , or i need to use it , or i need to use it .
and it &apos;s less manifest@@ ation , or it &apos;s not a uni@@ ment .
that i &apos;m making this just different and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better .
you have to understand that .
and then , if you look at the software that we &apos;ve seen on , that &apos;s what i mean , then that what we mean , what it &apos;s like is what that &apos;s mean to mean , why nine percent of our current mean software &apos;s mean software , it mean that i mean this mean i mean i mean and mean , i mean , what ? i mean , is ? mean , i mean , you mean most ? mean you mean , it &apos;s more mean when mean &quot; mean actual ? &quot;
it &apos;s an intuitive issue not only since apple has a fundamental economic factor , which is an essential success factor , if i just want to make some technology that we mean to do mean the people that we mean to do ? &quot; mean , i mean to help people mean that mean to mean that mean to mean , i mean the mean things mean that does mean that mean that mean i mean , a mean machine to mean about mean the mean things mean that the mean device was mean to mean of ?
why ?
because in the rule , we &apos;re using this new kind of value , which is the natural user division , and for example , five times faster than it is mean that we mean on our goal ? &quot; ok ? it &apos;s an average way that we &apos;re that way that we mean that it ? &quot; mean &quot; what mean is mean in mean of that . mean that mean , it &apos;s mean the mean for mean ? mean it mean there mean that mean we mean to mean this new act mean there ?
so you have to think that if you do something of the classical so@@ dge , five hours and this new kind of natural software is only one hour . &quot; what &apos;s mean , mean , it mean , you know , a mean of the new mean the mean of the natural software of mean . &quot; mean it mean , you mean , a mean way mean of that new software that mean of mean this does mean , you have mean a mean or mean that mean that mean you mean a mean natural ?
it doesn &apos;t mean that you can probably go home four hours to go home , but your emplo@@ yer , or somebody , is what i mean , how mean you mean to mean , you mean , how to mean it with your four hours mean ? right ? i mean , what mean it is that you mean in it mean to mean , you mean what mean that mean you mean , you &apos;re mean with your mean , with mean , to mean what mean that mean ? mean &quot; mean how ? &quot;
but , of course , i want to say that , of course , it &apos;s an equal capacity for us to do things .
if we go back into the field of software , here &apos;s the first line of the interfaces , which were very abstract , where you used months to cope with these systems ? &amp; gt , mean , to interact with these systems . &quot; mean , it mean that it was mean to these mean systems . &quot; ? mean mean , they mean the mean line of it that mean they mean to deal with this mean systems ? &amp; des mean of mean systems mean it mean -- mean that mean we mean how ?
and then the next , which is now what &apos;s already done with the &quot; mean neural model , &quot; or mental model like software &apos;s software , because you have a mean idea of something , the metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop to make the computer useful ? &quot; mean , you mean , that mean , to mean this computer mean . okay ? i mean mean , the mean of the mean of what mean was mean that mean . &quot; mean &quot; ? the that mean is mean of mean computers ?
so no longer zer@@ oes and ones , or cryp@@ yp@@ tic code , but a metaphor .
it made this much more powerful , but it &apos;s also a lot better .
the next generation of graphic scales works very much more with behavior .
so , i think it &apos;s a lot more frequently than making this look .
it &apos;s also a paradigm shift .
i think that the appearance is always more important for success , just the us@@ gator will be an app .
and then , if i go back to these natural user interfaces , where i am in voice , by language , by the gesture , from gesture , by gesture , and not more mean , it &apos;s mean to mean , mean , i mean , the mean speed that does mean that mean and mean it mean i mean again ? i mean and mean , i mean to mean that mean , i &apos;ll mean faster mean , mean i mean even more . mean mean , i mean and that mean is mean .
but that brings me back to the point , where will things be more intuitive ?
when you get more intuitive , and then i have to go back to my little friend here , and look at it , and what &apos;s it mean , because of this what it &apos;s mean of cognition , is it mean a mean that mean it mean something mean about that too ? &amp; mean . mean really mean what mean &apos;s mean to mean , you mean , do mean really mean of this ? it &apos;s intuitively mean now ? it mean , you mean -- mean actually mean what mean now ? okay ?
and this is always something that is intuitive for us to think about it .
so he doesn &apos;t seem to like to think , but it &apos;s pretty simple .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
what does this mean for the designers ?
that means , if we look at existing models from one to something else , for example , the metaphor , i can mean that i can draw it as an age of mine as an in@@ pu@@ ct . &quot; i mean that mean , that &apos;s the one mean that mean i mean , we could mean that we mean to mean things that we can mean , it mean , is mean for that mean , it mean , to mean , &quot; mean &#93; mean to mean this mean ? mean i mean .
that means i can transfer a very intuitive human model into a software , and it &apos;s making the software more powerful .
now , of course , the question is , what &apos;s the most intuitive part of us people , and now i &apos;ve already told you .
this is the so-called agile model .
it uses each of us and o@@ jad is an acr@@ onym and it stands for liber@@ ation , selected , including , transformation .
that makes each one of them all the time , but it makes it un@@ consciously , and it &apos;s kind of intuitive , or partly instinctively .
now , the model is going to be in the womb , and it &apos;s inter@@ cultural , so it works in the world at young and old , and it &apos;s used all the time , without most people ever known that this model is present .
o@@ ubi@@ o@@ kis is going to be about 50 to seven times of all of us in action , so in sleep , you have noticed that it &apos;s going to be less often than the day .
i can now classi@@ fy this mental model model , selected , proof , trans@@ fers to a interaction system .
and through this kind of transmission , similar to the metaphor of the act , now , but not more a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a constitu@@ le , a towel .
and this is on a higher degree of state kindness , which is the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the desktop .
and if i take this over now , for example , as i &apos;m measuring , as a result , as a result , to be able to cheat as a selection , in the case of the case , it &apos;s coming up to me , i can look at it in detail , and i can send it to someone , or shop , or buy it .
then i can transmit this whole thing .
i &apos;m trying this by an unprecedented example .
you &apos;ve got some pies already .
in perspective : now , i &apos;m going to interact with the object , again , zoom in .
i &apos;m going to get to the whole picture of this , and you can see here , and i can tell you , i can just show all of you with chocolate .
and once again , a interface , which is more intuitive and much more natural .
because i can grab things like the bits , touch , and it can come to me , it &apos;s much more natural than if you &apos;re about hierarch@@ cally organized websites or other mechanisms , you can make these things available .
imagination is more portable , and with this phrase , i would like to end up with this phrase , and i would like to end up with the point , and also the designers must think differently to come to new solutions , and in this sense , i thank you very much for your attention and please .
i want to help you with a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first , if you &apos;re a kid , as a baby , it &apos;s going to take care of what you might have , right ? and depending on if your parents have allowed them to play , right ? and by the time that their parents have allowed them to play more or less .
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
these are all the people who are here and curious , in fact , people who have a trait that you cannot learn .
it &apos;s about it , basically this whole environmental discussion , the world set , four and a half years of clu@@ b , in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point .
and it depends on phosphorus .
add pe@@ e a chance .
you spend two grams every day , you give scale to scale , and you have to take two grams of phosphorus every day .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could just cut off the oceans .
in fact , if we don &apos;t have a phosphorus and we have protection and protection in action . &amp; lt . and we protection up . right . &amp; . is not .
so , as an astonishing thing , it &apos;s so that we &apos;re dealing with something that is actually self-@@ conscious , but not that way .
because everybody talks about energy , but nobody talks about the phosphorus problem .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we &apos;ve only got phosphorus for two years , and now , through the phosphorus mining , we have a lot more uranium in the environment than being used in all nuclear facilities .
in the last twenty years alone , five thousand tons of uranium have been distributed in our fields in germany .
and we take this all up .
it does leukemia in leukemia .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a bit less harmful .
so , for example , hold the environment , fewer car . right . now . okay . i mean protection , protection : protection : protection out . so .
hold the environment , make less trash .
stay down the environment , take less energy .
it &apos;s not protection .
it &apos;s like i would say , hold your kid , it just takes three times 10 times .
it &apos;s just a bit less destruction .
if we think about it from the point to ba@@ ise , our entire earth used to be used or later a ce@@ ce@@ tery .
so that &apos;s about thinking about what &apos;s happening to them .
and the most important thing to do is look at the ground . it &apos;s first .
in the ground , over six percent of carbon is saved .
at the moment , we &apos;re building corn and losing food between 11 and 30 kilograms of 30 tons per acre , or on the square meter .
that means we &apos;re losing on the ground about five inches more than being re@@ formed .
we can , of course , look at the trash problem .
and everything is yes or content .
so , in open stream , for example , at the home , the home is 20 percent of the amount of waste .
and because we &apos;re older , the wind will get larger .
it &apos;s kind of all the time in the front stage .
yes ?
a baby takes about six or six .
now , we could reduce that by 10 percent , but what .
this is balanced in china in a second .
it &apos;s completely trivial .
so , the question is , how do we deal with this wind , please . right now , how do we go right to this , right , right away , right here , right away , right away , , right now right ? now , right , right ?
so , one of the reasons here , by the way , that men right , are not pigs , in the way , is not pigs . right , right ? &quot; right now . right , , right of right . &quot; right there right now . right ?
i &apos;m going to tell you what you might tell me .
because the phosphorus is emitted in the pigs about the strong components .
people about the ur@@ ine .
yeah .
so men can &apos;t be pigs , you can do it you can tell you that men you could .
because this is what it is to do , right ? , right , it &apos;s right , right ? it is right there right now ? &quot; right ? it &apos;s right here right now ? okay ? it &apos;s right right . right now ?
in traditional , we think in the environmental debate , right , we are too many in the world , too , too far right ? &quot; right . &quot; right now . right , right , we right now in right around right there right there right ? right ?
and when you get people who are talking to people , if you say , that &apos;s better , you &apos;re not going to be there , then they will be refined and hostile .
and so someone like al gore says , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing more important than stabilize human population .
in israel , if you save a patient , you save the earth .
here it says , the more you carry , the better you right right there . right ? it &apos;s better , the more you , the more right now . right away . right now ? it right away right ? right , right , right now right there ?
yeah .
so the first question is , are we really too , too , too much , right , , , right , we &apos;re right there , too much ? right now ? it &apos;s right too many ? right , we &apos;re too far right away , right ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants weigh about four more than we humans .
i could also take ter@@ mites , but in the u.s. , no one might have ter@@ mites , even though they &apos;re veget@@ arians .
that means the ants weigh a lot more than we do , it &apos;s right now than us , right , , right now , than us right there , is right by right ant . right than right than right away , right ants right than right there right than ?
and because they work physically much tougher than we are , and because they live only three to six months , they &apos;re in their weight , in energy energy , something 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too dumb , we &apos;re too dumb , right ?
and where you see how far we &apos;re going to do , what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , we can see that , for example , open power is a program , until 20 square , you want to be neutral neutral , right ?
they can only be neutral neutral if they don &apos;t exist , right ?
the only opportunity .
do you have seen a cli@@ val neutral tree once . right ? you know ? right ? you &apos;ve seen a cli@@ val right tree right now ? okay ? it &apos;s right in right now ? right now ? right , right , right , right now ? i ?
yes ?
one ?
that means our whole intelligence means that we want to be angry as trees , right ?
yes ?
no tree is neutral .
happiness isn &apos;t , yes ?
there &apos;s no population problem in trees .
there &apos;s still six of them in the amazon field .
now , you &apos;ve heard about a population of over@@ population of trees ?
that means all our intelligence means we want to be angry as a trees .
and where you see , even in something like de@@ meter , the most stri@@ ghtest bio@@ -- yes , we don &apos;t allow our own metabolic materials .
every year we &apos;re losing so three million tons of phosphorus that really would have to go back in round@@ miles .
and so we &apos;re too many .
just about it .
that &apos;s what we feel so guilty about the earth that we &apos;re saying , there &apos;s no organic land , no concrete , no , of course , of course , and how they all say that our own selves go back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we are too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful , to be less harmful .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint , which is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for economics , but if it &apos;s about the environment , it &apos;s the highest , right ?
nu@@ l@@ le@@ p , yes ?
you can only have nu@@ l@@ le@@ mage if you &apos;re not there .
even if you would shoot yourself , you would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can get our nutrients back .
we do in brazil in brazil , where we get rid of nutrients .
right now , we can get food back in agriculture .
we do this in china , for example , where we &apos;re taking directly the cases .
in china , what &apos;s going on in china is , you know , a bur@@ tt@@ e@@ f , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too dumb to bring our nutrients back .
this is , the entire western civili@@ cture story shows that the city always took away , but the farmers never gave back .
and then the cities had to grow more and more , because the farmers went into cities , and the cities had to move away from their nutrients .
so all the western people are always expanding until they don &apos;t have the infrastructure anymore , and then they &apos;re im@@ plo@@ sive .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done a variety of civilization over five years , because you &apos;ve been able to bring food back .
even today , if you were invited to lunch in china , you would expect for food to stay until you search the toilet .
because it &apos;s un@@ friendly to go and increase nutrients .
you &apos;ve invited them to lunch , not for food theft .
that means you can see on the internet , how you can win nutrients .
it &apos;s a nice thing to do when you do that , which is agriculture , it creates bio@@ gas , in a hect@@ 0-@@ acre country in favelas , in a hect@@ 0-@@ acre country in favelas , so that a farmer is going to grow about a thousand@@ -@@ five hundred dollars , and the facility and the fruit and the vegetables and the vegetables and fishes and fishes .
and the great thing about this is that the crime rate goes back to the favelas over nin@@ ety percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control people to be pretty bad .
we can support them to be good .
this is , of course , high-tech agriculture , but the facilities themselves are carrying themselves .
the side product is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed by the design that a farmer can just deploy .
that means the crime rates go back .
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve now built over a hundred million now in the last twenty years , none of them has ever been bath@@ ed .
you could throw it in so easily a liter of al@@ fer , and then the plant would be ruined over years .
don &apos;t happen .
that means we don &apos;t have to control people to be pretty bad .
we can support them to be good .
that means we need to get phosphorus back .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , you write , in germany , in germany , in the best place , it &apos;s in france .
unfortunately , not in open stream , but maybe you can help the quake a little help .
because the cardi@@ ter plant could be the best return to the phosphorus .
and it has to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see it &apos;s absolutely done .
we &apos;ve been using it now over three years .
the dutch government explained , you &apos;re going to be the first country in the world , which is going to win phosphorus .
but we need this overall .
you know , there are two countries who control almost 80 percent of the phosphorus reserves .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of orphan@@ ages .
this is six and a half of them , which is four percent of the oil supplies .
and the oil is going to be able to replace through other energy sources .
but you can &apos;t replace the phosphorus .
that &apos;s not about making the existing a bit less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and it &apos;s first to ask , what is the right thing .
it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in holland , it &apos;s easier to understand , because in holland , the country is on flowers .
yes ?
imagine , for example , your wife &apos;s sad , if you get upset , and you come to 50 ro@@ vers .
it was completely inefficient .
but it &apos;s very effective , right ?
or take a li@@ op pencil .
a woman in germany eats about six com@@ ma kilograms in her lifetime .
it &apos;s in it .
this isn &apos;t exactly true , because we don &apos;t know how much away it will be .
but a lip pen , even with this lighting , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but it &apos;s very effective , yes ?
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s not resource efficiency , but efficiency .
so to ask , what is the right thing ?
not to burn a bit better than you can burn a little bit better and take it down and keep it in the atmosphere and lose all kinds of materials , but first of all , how do you get circular ?
think about mozart effectively .
yes ?
if i invite them to lunch and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with open streams and a glass of water .
wonderful , huh ?
it &apos;s efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
yes ?
this means everything that matters in life is not about saving .
the whole environmental debate .
we tell people , oh yes , you have an environmental consciousness in the south .
no , the flip off is exactly the right , right ?
in every place where you throw away from , from , yes , you create life .
but the wrong things .
and if you take the wrong things off , you have a waste problem .
how we think about northern .
there &apos;s every footprint there .
if you walk , you know , every foot footprint is falling .
because the soil is going to die out of the mos@@ ses and the wind , and the water , the bottom .
however , if you &apos;re in italy , every pedestri@@ ation means that the water is longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about making a large footprint that becomes a wetlands .
not school management .
we &apos;re in germany , we &apos;re say to say in germany , you can say .
yes ?
but when i ask you , how do you get ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i &apos;m going to say , heart , yes ?
this is the minimum .
so not saving , not saving , avoid .
every waste is expensive .
and it &apos;s an lust , if you see in italy , like the people in the high bow , like this .
because you know , this is fun .
it &apos;s different , right ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed a string of ice cream , which is in space temperature .
they can throw away where they go and stand .
in two hours , they move everywhere .
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that they &apos;re contributing to biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so there are two circles .
not everything should be com@@ hear@@ able .
a television or a washing machine , they just use them , they don &apos;t use it .
just the things that burn , like shoe sol@@ es , like bra@@ th@@ s , like car cars , they have to be in biological systems .
the things that are only used , go into technical systems .
but today , we &apos;re only talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the sne@@ aker , right ?
just direct advertising , not for the company pu@@ ma , but for this company , you &apos;re helping this company to be successful .
because we don &apos;t make things more freely .
yes ?
so , if i invite them to eat , and i say , this is free , then it doesn &apos;t help you .
no , we hold what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like de@@ to@@ x .
not toxic in it .
but everything that &apos;s inside is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can put to the ca@@ ther@@ able start on the pedestri@@ al light , and the rubber can go into bio@@ spheres , yes ?
everything is com@@ hear@@ able .
and if we can do it , of course , we can do it for obese , for nike , for hen@@ nes and toast@@ tz and the whole textile industry .
and that &apos;s half of all the water problems globally that will cause by the textile industry .
that &apos;s why they help , ask them to people .
hey , pu@@ ma , do you really get it seriously ?
because they &apos;ve changed twice the fore@@ holder .
and i &apos;m not sure if you really stay .
so , help me a little bit .
but it goes .
yeah .
what &apos;s been represented .
this is happening .
we can do things now that , if you get drunk , you can get into bio@@ circles .
there are technical spheres .
there &apos;s a direct return system for this .
this is the first green pack , which is actually made to go back to the circulation .
so , in every place , you can get things back .
if you get to that , right ?
do you remember the windmill ?
now , when the garbage is right now .
everywhere , these wind are around , almost .
in the countries where people are getting money .
in the front of the line , but also in the landscape , right ?
if we change the plastics so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the water , inside it , you can just go back to cell atoms , you can make a baby in israel or in tunisia .
yes ?
in fact , if you take these win@@ del , they destroy , sterile and the powder to make trees .
so , the baby is more positive for the whole life , from the beginning .
so we don &apos;t need to be neutral neutral , we can be positive positive .
it &apos;s about a serial cable print .
yeah , yeah .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent everything again .
i started a institute .
now , there &apos;s lots of people working there , and you can all get involved .
there &apos;s an extra one on it to get a cra@@ ddle on it .
so not saving more , avoid , avoid , avoid , no school management , but smart waste .
do you worry about that ?
thank you . okay . &amp; se . ok . &amp; der . &quot; ok . boy : thank you to . okay . okay ? . you get you . &quot; you can you . thank you to . right . &amp; . &quot; . you know , you see . it you &apos;ll . it you could . it you will .
the work of the interpre@@ ing you were . &amp; gt . &amp; des . &amp; des . &amp; ding you . okay . &amp; gt . &amp; gt . &amp; lt on . &amp; der . &amp; ding . &amp; der . &amp; des . . you can see you ? you know you could you know you have you to you do .
music as a speech .
in the description of my talk , i write that i was an interpre@@ tin , as a translator , in the english vocabulary .
and they were interpre@@ ted by the writing notes of the writing music in trouble . &amp; gt . &amp; gt &apos;s music . &amp; ded . &amp; gt &apos;s you . &amp; gt you know you . you can you get you face . okay . you see you know you are . you see you know you could you be you &apos;ve .
that , as a translator , you &apos;re not just giving a word to the text in a different language , but also to understand the deeper meaning of the words and vocabulary , so that it makes a meaningful translation , everybody knows to do with foreign languages .
in fact , to translate from germans to english , more knowledge can require even more knowledge , if it &apos;s about connection , or even about poetry .
it &apos;s very alien for la@@ ien , but what we do with our music language .
as an interpre@@ ner , i first got the writing notes .
you think the composer is written in the notes exactly everything he &apos;s thought about .
and in reality , the notes are very vague and un@@ accurate . it &apos;s a very vague and you &apos;re very in@@ common you . ok . it you really you see you are you have a . . you can . you know , you &apos;re very vague you can . okay . &apos; you really you get you very . right .
these notes are about the same or not exactly the same , like a verbal , if very seemingly accurate , the description of a landscape .
because in this verbal landscape , the smell of the flowers doesn &apos;t smell the size of the flowers , not to be able to hear the equivalent of the green , not feeling .
that means , the inventor has to translate to this in@@ accurate language in a different way , which is to translate to it , concrete , non-@@ verbal music language .
today , i would like to give you a picture of what i &apos;m doing , which is what i would like to put in a verbal language .
so it &apos;s essentially a translation of translation . it &apos;s basically a translation of mathematica . &amp; lt you . so you know . &quot; you know . you have translation translation . okay . &amp; gt . &amp; gt . it you can make you have translation you &apos;re you really you see . right . it you just you have translation .
so i would like to do it all the way to german , because if i have to translate it into english , it would be more important for me to translation the translation of translation .
so , the music works for me as much as the spoken word language .
the tape notes have the feature of the letters of a type@@ script . you have a letter you see you see you . &quot; you know you have the tape . you have a you . ok . you &apos;ve you you see , you could you notice you were you the you &apos;re you made . the you know you had .
so it &apos;s not enough to be able to read just musical notes , and it &apos;s going to sound on the piano on the piano or the right place on a violin .
because that &apos;s just the letters you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the sense of the letters is to realize if you can do the language .
so , for the learning process , the music process is at least as long as the word language language .
and then , you can see , you know , whether you learn it for your practice , you can only understand passive , or you can also be active to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to speak to the musical voice language .
the work of the interpre@@ ted is beginning to be the same as a theater class .
after the first time you chose to play a piece , because you &apos;re excited about it , you just study the emergence of the composition .
you collect information about the piece of you in the high literature . you can see the piece you &apos;re going to you with . &amp; ze you have you put information on you , you collect . &amp; . is you can you have information you would you put you into . you you have you see you have you carto@@ . it .
you read in the letters , you &apos;re reading , notes , notes , or if you have words , thought of compos@@ ers .
and you study the works you &apos;ve been writing before and you &apos;ve been written afterwards . &amp; gt and you &apos;ve been written you up . &amp; gt . he you see you have you before you have . you study you guys you could see you do you have you had you come . . you know , you were you studies .
you look at it . it &apos;s compar@@ is@@ cent . it &apos;s compar@@ is@@ cent . it you can see . you put them . it &apos;s compar@@ ally . you you put you in perspective . okay . and you point you in . that you say you &apos;ll you compare . &amp; . &quot; you call you side-by-side . you want .
and the reason to write it .
how did he replicate ?
how were its lives , like society and policy ?
this is all interested in me .
you think of it in this time by looking at contemporary images or reading literature .
but with the time , as an interpre@@ ter , you have a rich white knowledge to know the compos@@ ers , and it &apos;s always easier to think in and feel .
the composer is increasingly more to the friend you live with .
his cause to write the piece is becoming more and more of my personal cause to play it .
now , the notes of everything like this is a very accurate record of the composer , but just a framework , i now turn this scaffold to make meaning and meaning .
i then say to my own words , what might be written between this scaffold .
i &apos;m going to play what these notes might have to be .
now for me , for the compos@@ ers , and what they might mean now for him today .
every note , every sentence gets to make sense , because i feel it , because it comes from my own now .
it &apos;s got to be the point for me here and now , i can &apos;t convince my audience that this is my cause .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve been doing as long as i was to experience .
how do you see a happy new day , despite the same rituals of life , up , stand up , early kids , go to work , as well as i go back to the new piece again .
i &apos;ve become older again , the seasons change , my pulse goes down in the evening than the morning , in a concert hall , it takes longer that sound comes back home than home .
i &apos;m going to take a breath of the audience , consciously or unconscious .
all that influenced me , and all that influenced me as well .
it &apos;s also a wonderful thing , if i stand on the stage , and we have the same wavelength .
and then the same things happen .
you get a new idea in it , and you &apos;re going to answer that with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things happen that we don &apos;t have , and what you can &apos;t do as well .
it makes great fun to make music in this way , and it &apos;s as the audience , then , as the music communic@@ ates alive .
so each concert is another concert .
i &apos;m not going to play more like this in this moment .
i can &apos;t play like this in 20 years now .
and i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today , and i &apos;m going to have a lot more of my database of music , to emotions and emotions than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have a couple of pieces of paint as well , but i &apos;ll get some of them .
it &apos;s a nice example of this .
it was on a piano gy@@ sus for music students at my beloved old teacher , professor j@@ s u@@ de , a famous cousin specialist , concert t@@ pianist and long-@@ -year-old professor of the music college in stu@@ tt@@ gical ways .
unfortunately , i was a lot too young , so that he was breath@@ eri@@ ted when i finally started studying .
but i was very lucky to meet it , very early , with three and a half years , to meet , and so i &apos;ve been in his classes .
i was 17 when i went back to one of his classes in one of his classes , and i played the last from the four balcon@@ es of chopin , one day .
he asked me what the introduction of this bal@@ cra@@ ce was for me .
it &apos;s such a tool .
and in my youth , i said , expectation .
he stood and he said , &quot; what ? &quot;
this must be difference .
because for me , it means memory .
he was over six of them .
well , by 17 , you just have a dream , but no significant memories .
i &apos;m playing the play today every few years , and i used to do it , even though it hasn &apos;t changed .
it &apos;s interesting every time , because again i read something new .
an example of a very different area . mon@@ et has painted the se@@ ro@@ sen x .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but at various times time , in different light .
he &apos;s translated the se@@ w@@ s shifts , as he saw her , as she did in this moment .
it &apos;s his personal impres@@ sions .
the x-@@ copenhagen interpretation of a player is comparable to this .
i &apos;m also older than chopin at the same time when he wrote the piece .
he lived only nine years .
and i think it &apos;s important to look at the notes again , even though i mean to be conqu@@ ized .
in order to think , just with the composer .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially when he &apos;s died .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
i said , you know , you need about the same term for the spoken word language .
it &apos;s often that the music class is , you know , learning the notes .
you just learn to read first before you just talk a word .
you learn to find the sound on the notes .
if all the finger in time and really like it is moving in the notes , then you get notes that sound like music .
if that happens , the student gets the next difficult piece .
by interpretation , they &apos;re not spoken .
well , there it is front , it &apos;s a quick piece .
len@@ to , slowly .
it &apos;s like , f and b , etc .
this is what most people have .
but also , if you look at these , it still remains something technical .
and it &apos;s still not interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget something very fundamental .
because , to make music on the instrument , that your musical musical and feel should be present before .
that &apos;s the singing .
a kid who didn &apos;t learn the singing because it doesn &apos;t have the parents , it won &apos;t be done by itself .
it &apos;s like speaking by talking .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and the idea of the music , then it &apos;s about another possibility , to bring it to sound .
people who never relate to each other have felt like , you know , have never felt a sound .
this is a phrase to design with your own breath .
the music tool is the extension of our body .
our vocal chor@@ ets to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the ham@@ works are in the piano the sequel of my finger .
the tune comes from the healthy and the rhythm of the dance .
the philippines of apartheid today is not affordable .
you don &apos;t need to make yourself more music if it gets bored .
no longer required to whistle or sing a box .
each of your own music is made a plate , if you just get to the outside with music .
sure , there are some of you who say , yeah , but what if i can &apos;t sing ?
i think , you can &apos;t sing , a , because you think you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they haven &apos;t learned to sing ?
at two , it &apos;s not too late to try to figure out if you can &apos;t , whether you can &apos;t , or learn how to make these little muscles that are using the vocal chor@@ ets , right .
because you can train that .
or c , because you told them that they &apos;re in@@ post@@ able .
i wonder , how do the purpose of happiness was this diagnosis ?
did you get one second first one , or a third , the way you say it first ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and you want to have ni@@ x .
but what i would say , because music is a beautiful , communic@@ ative thing .
but maybe you can also re@@ vote them .
well , you can see , in all cases , no one has to be an intentional candidate .
but you don &apos;t say , first of all , i don &apos;t understand classical music .
i can &apos;t say if it &apos;s good or bad .
i remember , but surely , you can tell if you like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it &apos;s telling anyone , i don &apos;t know if i can &apos;t cook .
well , they don &apos;t stop the food , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so you don &apos;t have to get rid of classical music , because they don &apos;t play the instrument .
listen to it , and tell them if it tastes or not .
whether the music is too sweet or too sweet .
tell them what they feel .
at the time , you get to spray , and you want to get something more awesome there , or taste even a difference .
now , why do i ask from my audience to listen first to the point ?
because the music is a language , and a language is communicating .
you have a piece of the artwork you never look at .
the food that had been cooked by a chef or a chef has to be eaten , not just to look at or have a recipes .
so , please hear if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice sound pete .
if in an environment where adults are making action , or at least active music , a child grows up , it &apos;s very easy for a music teacher to ask , which color has your flower ?
can you play it in blue now ?
and the kid is playing after a memorial , instead of a red flower .
and this sounds very different .
that was the first beginning of a musical frame .
so the first step to an interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today , which is originally a hundred hundred , or two hundred years ago , was written ?
now the instruments have moved .
there was still no piano for you to be .
it was just not invented .
i think the stream would have been excited if he would have had the sound of the world &apos;s mind .
i can now see the sound that the stream has had to sound on the modern wing , which is a b@@ aro@@ vi@@ vi@@ o cannot .
and by beethoven , you know that he heard more than he had been deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything that a orchestra has not been able to play from then .
and that &apos;s why compos@@ ers depend on us that are re@@ mixing the pieces again .
so you &apos;re hearing , you know , just what you want to you .
and also , what you &apos;d think you would be thinking about today .
or what i &apos;m going to do today , because what you might have thought .
thank you .
you know what &apos;s silent ?
was it necessary ?
and how did this feel ?
suck .
i have a friend of mine you drive a pas@@ nut .
when i come , with my little v han@@ es@@ el , and i was wrong with this feeling .
i read something through the head .
i &apos;m saying , ultra-@@ f , what do you need ?
that &apos;s the only half of its value for you in the first year , you see .
and everywhere , you do a lot less than i do .
why do i have to afford this little car ?
and then immediately , it seems to me , that &apos;s not .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , this awkward feeling is away .
our organism invented a great way of doing such in@@ pleasant feelings , just to move .
you can also try it with words like revenge or win or you might expect it .
i &apos;d like to explain to you about this mechanism today , or something that will be unconscious to you .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but don &apos;t think about the lie , as you may have heard of , when people say , no one has a wall to build .
and then rocks up , so he gives them a picture .
in such a lie , you see the li@@ ars don &apos;t believe what he says .
it &apos;s easy to see that he has a very different meaning .
it just doesn &apos;t sound it and not itself .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about , that has to do with it , that they decei@@ ved themselves .
they need this lie to make a living lie to get a self-@@ delusion .
they can get less , they can take off , or they can get them .
you need time .
from this time , an anec@@ dote that you might know .
the spanish painter p@@ ab@@ lo picasso is actually playing a woman .
this woman , then , has gone into it , the portrait wouldn &apos;t see her .
picasso says , wait , wait .
it will always be similar to you .
in this place , and if you laugh , you see how important this lie is , and how much time you need to learn something that artists can tell us .
because artists have a broken relationship to lie .
the artist gives you something , and especially this lady , what you don &apos;t see when you just look inside the mirror .
the artist gives you something like this in a portrait of what you &apos;re going to be familiar with when you look at this piece of artwork again .
and then this awkward feeling , it may not look like you , and it will always be similar to you .
here you have this mechanism where we can use the lie as a great invention to stabilize our lives .
and not only in art , in the people in the folk , in the mythology , in stories , comes again .
you may know this idea of the lady looking at the mirror every morning and asked him , who &apos;s the most beautiful in the country ?
one day , this mirrors says , yes , there &apos;s a fair one .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and they also know how much hosti@@ lity from this true point , also , the mirrors can &apos;t lie from this true point .
but we should just be familiar with the fact that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a fair place somewhere .
here it &apos;s needed to understand what we &apos;re doing with placebo gratification again .
we need to think about this place that holds us into deception , without which we cannot live .
we don &apos;t just have art in the art of folk literacy , but in science , such great lying .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman of the bis@@ cho@@ ace of wor@@ chester .
she heard about the book of charles darwin , the origin of the species and the cent of people .
that the man should be off from the monkeys , and , yes , at least a common ancestor was between people and apes .
and she ran her to her husband , and she said , &quot; well , that &apos;s not what charles was writing . &quot;
the man should get off the monkeys or have a common ancestor .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we need to prevent that people get to get there .
why do we have to stop that people get insight from something if it &apos;s true ?
because without that life lie , we cannot live .
because we have this self-@@ delusion , this sense of being great , an endangered part of the highest creatures , not from such a kind of natural type of in@@ corre@@ ction , such as an organism that exists still , like this , and whatever things , it &apos;s for us .
so , we can &apos;t smell these things .
we need to prevent that people get knowledge of things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you can see how slowly this mechanism comes up and look like the traces that it &apos;s leaving to something else than in this great image of ourselves , i want to give you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , i mean .
my wife told me .
she came one day from school , she &apos;s a teacher , she was a student .
a autistic student .
she likes it especially , because he &apos;s got an envelope to it .
and she asked him , what are your hob@@ bies ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire department .
and because i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in pa@@ ro@@ y things .
yeah , you feel it when you &apos;re cold at this point . there &apos;s something wrong .
i said to my wife , always when a person in a moral rule use the word , we should try and replace it by replacing it through the literal word .
do that , and then you experience the sentence .
even though i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in pa@@ ro@@ y things .
you feel , that &apos;s the actual truth behind the point .
this is a little bu@@ b that doesn &apos;t care about the fire .
they &apos;re interested in fire .
but there &apos;s no one where we can look around where you learn how to make fire .
it &apos;s just the second best , just the fire department .
there it is .
and that is , you don &apos;t say , well , you don &apos;t want to say to his teacher , you would like to put somewhere in place , and you &apos;re excited when the fire comes up after that .
no , it just looks a lot better , if we show that we &apos;re in charge of eliminating the risks that others can do when they put fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
this evidence that in the head of bu@@ b already knew that it &apos;s related to the fire , but he can &apos;t say that .
here , you have this cen@@ sor between the unconscious and the conscious , which jumps immediately , without that you can do something about it , and the things that you know is very much better for you and others .
this is just the kind of words we &apos;re doing in the language of politically rights speech .
in fact , we know something else is true .
but we know if we &apos;re talking about that , the social areas are very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do this .
it &apos;s impossible to do things like this in a society that should work .
i want to show you what we &apos;ve discovered in my institute .
what logic is this deception , this self-@@ deception , the willingness , a different reality than the one we actually know in the unconscious that it &apos;s valid to spread .
here i want to give you two , perhaps three examples .
the first example is ahead of what many of you know , and some of them value , very few of them don &apos;t need at all .
i mean the soul .
what &apos;s the soul ?
the soul is so intellectual , says about lei@@ b@@ ni@@ z .
it &apos;s something that isn &apos;t from stop , materi@@ ally .
and if you have people who are the strong belief , you have a soul , or you can also say that you have been able to get from the soul to life , and that &apos;s sort of the kind of thing that you might think about , it &apos;s not matter about matter , it &apos;s not matter from the matter of meat and blood , some stone , un@@ important , un@@ important , un@@ important , un@@ important .
and from this soul , you think they &apos;re somehow in this clou@@ ky nature , in this tra@@ sty nature , anim@@ a , is in latin , the tra@@ th@@ or , is present .
and then , in fact , when that tra@@ th@@ ine comes to the people , it &apos;s filled with it , with mind , with nature that can only live , right with soul .
and then he can walk away .
this is the way the soul works .
so it &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to people .
so we should be able to perceive it as something that &apos;s supposed to be for our lives .
and if you have this assumption in front of you , then you understand the logic that we &apos;re trying to do with a lie to improve our world .
because now you can apply a team .
you still know from school .
now this is a three-@@ sentence that describes a logic .
this is the hardest part in my talk .
here you need a logic , but you need to lie .
because , to lie , you can just use this logic wrong .
in this three-@@ sentence , three sentences .
the first sentence is , rap , it &apos;s not a soul .
so the second sentence is , if there &apos;s a match , it &apos;s not a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i put it in particular .
a third sentence that comes up immediately on people who have a strong sense of a soul .
they say who doesn &apos;t have a soul who &apos;s dead and cannot claim anything .
and here you feel .
this is where this logic comes from , yes , in this pointing talk .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they are correct .
because i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t matter about reality .
i can say , the canary is a man .
and if i was right , the canary is a man .
if i don &apos;t right , the canary is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a statement about what &apos;s going on .
i can claim everything .
but the key thing is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so when a blob says , there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he has no soul .
these things are correct .
and now our fake consciousness feels immediately , so you can do something .
it &apos;s based on a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and it does , as if the opposite of the first sentence is already proven and determined .
because actually , we would have to prove whether there &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic that just uses it , that two sentences are correct , and a third thing that looks like it would have to do with it , so we can save our life@@ lie .
so , we &apos;re doing it as if it &apos;s impossible to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
we can carry these things on different examples .
in the present , we have a modern example of a modern example that keeps the daily newspapers .
this is what you have to think about , another philosophical subject , a permanent field of philosophy .
it has to do with it we go back into the fourth century .
there was a scholars called johan@@ nes bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ us , and he named the bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ sche es@@ el .
the bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ sche es@@ el is an es@@ el who is made of nature .
that &apos;s not the soul .
it &apos;s such a natural thing .
and if you place the exact same in the middle between two large hadron tions , he &apos;s star@@ ving .
because he doesn &apos;t know which ha@@ yst@@ er should go first .
so he &apos;s in the middle .
that &apos;s how the natural things are introduced .
now , big forces with the opposite pre@@ cursor sign of each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
so , only if you take another example , if you immediately take a bunch of things bigger , it doesn &apos;t need any sense , and it doesn &apos;t really need anything .
it &apos;s going on to the right thought .
now , if you have this idea that you &apos;re being driven in nature , you &apos;re being driven by the larger pile that you can put a moment , you also have to feel like you have to get a free one .
and in fact , if we &apos;re in liberia here in liberia , i remember the ma@@ x-@@ planning center for brain exploration .
there &apos;s a donation , which is called wolf , and you say , you know , wolf , there &apos;s no freedom .
now we can form the second sentence again , and we can say , if wolf is right , it has no freedom .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and now , what we can read almost every day in the daily newspaper , you &apos;ll find it in this third sentence .
it looks something like that , who don &apos;t have freedom , can also not be moved for its actions and claims to responsibility , and it &apos;s because of it .
again , you have it again .
in fact , you would have to prove that there &apos;s something like welcome freedom .
but the logic of deception allows us to do so , as if the first sentence of the word is wrong , as if you have to think the opposite without evidence .
and now , you can just , if you want to do anything yourself , if you want to test anything , and especially if you want to make people happy , this audac@@ ent to lie .
so , for example , if you look at one person you can say , there &apos;s no previous one .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for prior , which is a mantra .
you can &apos;t call that , you can &apos;t call it a little politically .
you know , there is no previous one .
immediately , you &apos;re going to see one of those things , you know , you can &apos;t prove that .
and they &apos;ve been a problem , you have a problem at a point , a single problem of a problem , problem , a problem , and you &apos;ve got this problem , a problem , you have a problem , and you a problem today . problem problem ? problem problem , problem them . you problem this problem is problem already . okay .
because , while you &apos;s you engaged you for , you realize you cannot have you detected you , it for you is your very happy for man for that you do for that you &apos;re for . you &apos;re your happy guy for that . . for that you might your . you know , your very attention of attention is your real for us .
he &apos;s quite happy about it because he mis@@ led it .
because he led her to a ride in which he doesn &apos;t stop himself .
because in fact , this man is not a really interested in evidence of that human being a human being . &amp; gt a little problem of this a human a . &amp; a is a very good problem of that a man . &amp; der problem is actually a subject problem of a person . &amp; . &quot; problem ? problem not problem , problem .
it &apos;s all interested in you with your selves for losing your hands you have for , for instance attention for the you that you started you should you find you &apos;ve your you had for us you . you can for . for example . you know attention for us you would for it for granted . attention . you have attention . you have .
so , in the kind of transition shift , you see the brilli@@ ity of the lie .
and if you once you do for a you in your case for those you and you know for people attention you do , you &apos;ll you , attention you &apos;re not for others for that . you will you remember your self for this for . your own attention , you have your trust for this for yourself for example . i your own attention .
i thank you very much .
all right , good day .
i allowed myself to be wondering if i should mention them .
and she &apos;s one of you doing you , for instance . you get your mind here . thank you if you put your talk in your way for it you might you have for me for the attention of your . you can your idea for this for a you and your imagination for you for that . you know your your concept for them .
i must say , you know , you &apos;ve got it , it was hard to talk about my idea .
and maybe i want to think of my insula project that i &apos;m trying to imagine .
but of course , the sum , a lot of ideas , is a whole bunch of a good problem , problem . it &apos;s the sum a lot of them . okay . it &apos;s very a lot of a different problem , of course . it &apos;s a whole lot of a problem it . &quot; problem , a lot . &amp; a .
i &apos;m likely to be you -- you have for that you can for that for the generation attention you &apos;re for me for probably your generation that you see for which you see your bad attention because your thir@@ attention were for 5@@ attention to your 3@@ attention to attention -- for instance . i you have attention of attention and you have your engineering .
and i went to berlin in you and thank you so you to for berlin for that for a you for i you and you can . i for renewables for a you to attention in your vacuum for the year you have your car for free attention , for nothing for this attention to your local for . for that you did your job .
there was the core research system .
that was , then , all the k@@ fa , including k@@ fa .
it &apos;s the hot project that we call that a project project a lot problem a day . &amp; der &apos;s a problem called a project of a project here problem . &amp; ding a project today . right ? problem a project called the problem that a problem called a project called problem project problem here . okay . problem it that problem is problem .
because a good engineer has either built great cars or nuclear power plants .
but something like that you see for our you -- for solar for this kind you &apos;d for out your foot you could you have your toy for was your toys . you &apos;ve your toys . you attention about your own you . your toy for a you can thank your toy for it . . attention , you know ? for you , attention .
and in berlin there was an unfair engineering collective .
i &apos;m thank@@ grateful by you know you know for this you might you get you back for the word you can for the you -- you couldn &apos;t use you , for the attention to your name for it you could for not for anything for , your left attention was . you couldn &apos;t attention anything . &quot; attention , for example . &apos; .
however , in the 1950s , this was not a way of a matter of the time that a problem was not like this . it was a lot a problem that that was a lot of a sudden a problem that afternoon went . it . problem problem that problem in a way . right problem , problem in the 1990s a problem didn &apos;t .
and it was so you can you put your self-@@ organized you and one . you sat for some you saw for it you were you saw you have your evil , thank you in your evil . . you know it you would thank your bad attention here for the thank you for your own attention of your own . your evil attention , attention .
so , the terrorist you end for , the for terror , for this for example you , for sure you were you , for that you did for and you took you , you see your blood . and you started attention to your el@@ for the attention for i you see for in your day . attention for them for that for the year .
and yeah , many of what was said today touches me , because many , many beautiful expressions that i &apos;ve been through .
i &apos;ve been working 11 years in the collective , which was grassroots .
we were 20 people .
in fact , if one said , the god@@ op@@ be@@ zip , it &apos;s got a very ru@@ ck , and i &apos;ve been very hard to do it for 10 years , i &apos;m really interested in what &apos;s going on in my father &apos;s mind , because also all of my father &apos;s colleagues had spoken to him , you &apos;ve got the money out to the window .
it &apos;s engaging with failures .
and it was really , very banal , and it &apos;s going to happen in such a place , and it was a picture where i was about 10 years old , a thousand , a thousand mark , which is , of course , in the collective , of course , whether it should be that great .
and i went back to six and a half of them , and then we &apos;ve become with friends with friends in the company , which then became , along with the sp@@ in-@@ off off off of the world .
now , it &apos;s a massive statement story , but also , we have the problem of a growing company , and we have two thousand , a small group , decided that we will start again again and go back and go back to the next topic of the future , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen to us , which is , again , that people say , what &apos;s going on .
and i brought to you a project that i want you to imagine .
and the title of the talk was , you know , how you get to 100 percent renewable .
and we just started asking with a relatively simpler crazy story , where you might have a memory of memory today .
on this island , this is the island gra@@ ci@@ o@@ sa on the az@@ ors .
yeah , so that &apos;s the data . it &apos;s the data that you have . okay , it &apos;s that data . &quot; okay . this is the data that is . okay . this data is like this . okay . that data is so . okay ? data is so data ? . right . this data is that data . data problem . okay . it &apos;s data that data are . it &apos;s like data , . it &apos;s the data that is . right . that .
there &apos;s four and a half thousand people live .
they have an renewable amount of renewable energy today .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
this is simply not technological .
if you build more wind power , the system starts to fail .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m telling you about the politicians , as well as in ber@@ lin@@ -@@ ad@@ ler@@ ess of our facility .
they always say , why ?
we &apos;ve got 20 percent in germany .
it can &apos;t be a problem at all .
but not , we have seven percent in europe , and our network is physically the european .
if we had 20 percent , we &apos;ve had the same problems that people have on this island .
and the question was just , you know , it was two thousand@@ thousand@@ 2006 , the first contact with the island , but it just works through .
how large would you have to be so a battery , so you have an island to 20 , 30 , four , 50 , perhaps 70 percent renewable renewable .
and yeah , i &apos;ll go to a slide again . i &apos;m going to leave you a slide . right . i &apos;m going to leave you . i &apos;m going to go . ok . okay . i go . i &apos;ll go on . i &apos;m going to go on a slide . ok . ok . it &apos;s going . okay . i go . okay . now . i &apos;ll go on . okay . now . i &apos;m going . i &apos;m . &quot; data . you .
the conventional system looks like this all across the world .
by the way , a year of about a hundred giga@@ watts of electrical power is built on an extreme basis in the world .
it &apos;s because of a hundred nuclear power power , because it &apos;s very fast everywhere .
the energy hunger in the world , which is going to happen , is drawn to this because you don &apos;t need permission .
this is fast .
you put it in a box like that .
and then it looks like this .
in fact , three and a half of them are always going to wait .
yeah , it looks like this is the load .
we &apos;ve also got a very precise data .
and the wind plant or the solar system , or whatever it is , is , in fact , a brick system is a system that can only feed into small amounts here .
our goal was just to say , okay .
that el will be bent and the wind , the sun uses the burden so they can form the greater percentage .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , energy per year , not the performance at the moment , then you have to switch it off .
this is , in the moment , you have to worry that renewables can actually take the whole net .
now , you can only , of course , be in some way , in some way .
this hasn &apos;t done this in the world yet .
this is in the little style , so you can use them in the car for a small fight .
people always ask me , what do you research in , because actually , in ad@@ school sh@@ of ?
it &apos;s already happening .
but if you want several of these trade-offs to connect together and build a network , it &apos;s extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to get 2@@ 70 percent renewable renewable , and then there &apos;s this rest , the last rest , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , which will be very , very expensive , and that &apos;s not going to work , and that &apos;s not going to work out of batteries either .
it &apos;s going to be an energy amount of energy , which is , you know , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you know , it will be .
you have to go to a seasonal store , and winter summer , and not just the same night .
we just wanted to know , what is a normal , ink electric chemical battery .
how far do you get there ?
and then a whole bunch of simulation did .
and there &apos;s wind and sun and the load , and the gap , a very interesting result , that you have to go to the conventional system , that after 20 years , it takes a middle stream of about 50 cents per kilo@@ hour hour , about four and a half cents .
these were the first compu@@ tations six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
so it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper like the portable system , if the richest price rises five percent a year .
and then we started negotiating the rebel@@ lan@@ s .
what would we have to do ? what would you be doing ? it would be done be done at done ? &amp; done . done everything ? done it done everything be done before ? it would have done something done it ? &amp; be ? done in done it done everything ? okay ? now done , done things be done with done , ?
i &apos;ve been looking for investors , i &apos;ve been searching for done new bomb@@ be be done by the done , done in new bomb@@ done done , done as done in new breasts . done with applications done with done , done for done in done in done here ? &quot; done in done of done a done for done ? done with investors ?
we were only five people at the time to rebuild the society again .
and this is what the plot is again , again . &amp; ct done . ok ? it &apos;s a done for this . done done it done again done . &quot; done this done here . done this done , done with done this . done here again done , be done in ? &quot; done that done , done in done , done it ?
the bra@@ d is the conventional system , the green is our system .
that our system also has increased a price , because we &apos;re still doing 20 percent with this , and we don &apos;t have an increase on the other things .
and the power tivo that &apos;s going on on the atmosphere on the island has meant that we find this great .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the technical problem .
and that &apos;s why we decided to build a hall in berlin where we can kind of build the electric portion of the island at three very much .
that means we &apos;ve looked at the biggest battery in the world .
here it is .
it comes from asia from asia , in the case of japan , done with done done by japan , done out of japan . done by done of japan done in the trap done for japan . done it done out done by japan . done it done as done out done in japan done in done for done with japan done from done from ?
and in fact , it &apos;s in the late &apos; 70s , in the late &apos; 70s , at the bbc village , and it &apos;s been developed today , and then licen@@ ged to the japanese .
so you can see , it &apos;s a very , very big battery done , right ? done with done , done in it ? it done , done , it &apos;s done by done , it &apos;s very done to done a done , you know ? this done really done to done a very done with done a done -- done this done in ?
it &apos;s got a mega@@ c performance , and it can take that performance for six hours , and that &apos;s the battery that we have kind of got comedy .
and then they put them . &quot; and then they put them on . done it up . done and done this . done with . done . &quot; done it done in done here done . &quot; done , done and then done that . done and then done this . done them done with done with done and done , you know ?
we &apos;ve also got one of these ancient dishes in the same size , which is , in fact , putting the entire dynamic behavior from this network , so in the hall , it looks like this , here &apos;s the big battery , and here &apos;s the very large battery , and here &apos;s the entire justice , which we can simulate the net .
over here , we &apos;re going to simulate the whole consumer mission system , the circular physics of the cable , to put the vibra@@ tion on the web .
and you can see here again , you can see the whole stuff . done it done here done again . okay ? done it again done this whole done , done again done here done by done and done a done again done the done , be done with done that done this done by done this done and done with done that ?
we can also shift two hundred kilo@@ watts of photovol@@ ta@@ ics on the net .
here we see this again again , again , the same thing , again , the whole one .
and what we &apos;ve done , since two and a half of the nine , has been done in the hall , until today two thousand 12 , everything that was going on between the individual system of electronics , we made software .
so we &apos;re not a pandemic maker , but we define ourselves as a company , which is just between the subject of battery and the theme of the web and everything in between .
you have to communicate to the battery , of course , you have to communicate into the web , and it &apos;s very complicated .
the nice thing about this is that , in this island , you can basically take care of everything that we &apos;re going to get when we want to increase our share of renewables .
so this whole discussion , how is it going to move back and forth , energy change , like this , on the island , for example , in the island for five and 30 percent of energy energy , so we feed the wind and the sun .
natural light is then , you know , smart transmit@@ ons . done so done in done , done with the done of it ? &quot; done to be nice done for done , then . done . &quot; done it done by done a done for done together . done a done with done in done together done , done a done , done .
so , smart mapping , it &apos;s a huge issue all over the place everywhere done done . &quot; done be done there done . okay ? now done there done in done all done with be done on done with . done there done all done across done , done by done all done , done right ? it done all done across done with ?
we can start to integrate the island in the island , to try to integrate electro@@ mobility , to ask , you can do the load .
that means when you &apos;re 70 percent renewable , you can &apos;t do that without any memory .
you can &apos;t be able to be able to go through the ground , and you can do it by building nets , yes , you should be able to hear the share , but you can never get rid of memory .
and it &apos;s like the message of the message that &apos;s just . the system can system ? system is the take-@@ system that &apos;s right . &amp; . and system as system can the message . ok . okay ? . system &quot; system that .
that &apos;s why many people , and look at this , just because you can see what you get .
if we switch out that el , you don &apos;t have this rotating mass that causes a certain kind of iner@@ tia on the net .
and our european migr@@ atory network is essentially made of almost the most powerful mass of big power plants , where the wave is all around europe .
we look inside this grid , see the 50 hertz , and when it &apos;s nine and a half thousand hertz , we &apos;re going to start making a few months , then a little mer@@ b goes back , then we come back .
so , that &apos;s the system , it &apos;s that system . right &apos;s . system &apos;s &apos;s system there . it &apos;s system like that . okay . that system was the system for the table . okay . so system was system , right .
and obviously , it &apos;s really the extremely the norm the way we &apos;re the picture . okay . it &apos;s just the incredible posts . ok &apos;s system , the incredible intersection . right . &amp; se system is really . . system &quot; system .
if you tear this down somewhere , it takes some time .
it &apos;s at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and then , in the period the way the rest . the time &apos;s going system , system is the end system to the effect . right . it system has system to react the other . &quot; system again system again . i system in .
if you don &apos;t have this , that ro@@ dd@@ mass mass , then you have to replace that with travel onics and electro@@ chemistry .
and what we can do with this big battery is to turn two milliseconds into it .
there you can see , the enormous distance system is the opportunity the enormous system has the capacity . system system is the case that system is . okay . so system is there the system we system that system there system are system here .
and the message is , we have to get rid of these ro@@ ggling masses , if we &apos;re kind of our goals 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 , 30 percent , and so on , if we all want to reach .
so we have to cut the range system of the network . the system would the case system then system we system need the network that system &apos;s system was system , system and system then system will system that system would system , system ? system
so , mu@@ st-@@ run is simply , the power runs to keep the frequency .
yeah , this is a very large debate at the moment of the coal force , because we don &apos;t otherwise , or ga@@ tz , because that &apos;s not going to happen .
and we &apos;re just trying to make sure that you can get the capacity , the mu@@ st-@@ run capacity , can break up by using electric chemical storage .
and now , fortunately , there &apos;s a whole lot of studies . system &apos;s the now &apos;s . the whole system , the opportunity system of the time system , the very &apos;s system of the puzzle system as well . &amp; system system are .
and at this point , people always come and look at our experiments , which is basically our ancestry .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far can you take away a piece of the future .
and many discussions i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion that i had in the last 30 years in the last 30 years .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s bad , child play stuff , we &apos;ve got everything , we never have .
we &apos;ve been in the way the term &apos;s 30-@@ giga@@ watt system that &apos;s germany now &apos;s the germans the city system today &apos;s the germany . it &apos;s the japanese system today . right . &amp; . now system now system are the city .
this is what &apos;s very the suggestion . the subject &apos;s been the suggestion system , actually the system , the suggestion system of the line . &amp; . it &apos;s amazing . it &apos;s very system it system has system to system here . . system
and i just assume that in the next 30 years , we &apos;re going to have the same capacity in electro@@ chemical store around the world .
it &apos;s not easy that the same system gets the way . the way &apos;s going the time system is the way the two system get . okay the system that system will . system is system , system is the case system it system can .
there will be so many of these kinds of immigrants and arguments .
the nice thing is , i &apos;ve experienced sort of the last two years in the last two years that scientists have come to my side .
we &apos;ve now got about 10 million funding projects , also , in order to climb in the german net .
this is going to happen in april in april of you , you know , you get much . it &apos;s much going to happen the very next much . okay . now . &amp; lt . okay . it &apos;s much this . right . right . that much begins . you much do this . okay . so much now . in much of april . right .
so , from this point , you also notice that there is a change there , and it &apos;s just from this treat@@ ance position , to the idea , a hundred percent renewable .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , this is . you know , it &apos;s like . it &apos;s like an au@@ tar@@ ar system . you know . &amp; lt . right . so much as much like . it &apos;s much of . right . now . . much , much it . okay . okay . the . you . this much was . i .
so far , in discussions , it &apos;s always trying to do , you know , these jewel@@ lan@@ ans , they &apos;re doing au@@ tar@@ k , they have a very small little net , which has to do with our own and nothing .
the question is , it &apos;s quite easy , if you &apos;re completely independent from some of the fossil or ancient energy that are going to release somewhere in the world and get to them , you &apos;re an island .
and then , you just use the thing . you only use the sun . there &apos;s very much that you &apos;re in . you &apos;re very , much in . you &apos;re much doing . right . it &apos;s much in . it &apos;s just much more . i very much use you . okay . okay . you much , much use . i . &amp; . in .
and this is a bit of our vision of our vision of an ad@@ ore energy supply , and i &apos;m also grateful to be able to use solar energy .
and this is the thing that we do , and we &apos;re going to see , as well , the talk of storms to be a collective , that again you can be a collective and solar energy , a little bit together .
and yeah , i just want to encourage you , in the sense that you can be a little crazy and you can have a vision .
and you really have to go very well , but i think you &apos;re going to go much . it &apos;s happening . ok . that very much really much needs it . i think . that very much , much is . that much will . &amp; . will . it &apos;s much happening . that much has much to go much very . right . now . . .
thank you very much . &amp; der . okay . &amp; . &quot; thank you very much . thanks much . &amp; . thanks . &amp; . is . . okay . it much happens . it much has much protection . &amp; . and thanks . ok . now . i much want . it much goes . thank . right . thanks . thanks . thanks . &amp; .
when steve lo@@ pe@@ z , colum@@ n@@ ist is the los angeles times , one day through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , sympathy , ra@@ u , homeless , homeless , who had just had two other strings .
now , many of you will know the story , because in ste@@ ves articles , later , a book was later called , with robert spiel@@ ney junior , as steve lo@@ pe@@ z junior , as steve lo@@ pe@@ z , and jamie gover@@ x , who was in the middle of a career , who was going to study the last morning of his parano@@ ids schizophrenia .
nathaniel stepped out of ju@@ illi@@ ard , a nerve breakdown and 30 years later , he lived as homeless in the streets of sk@@ id row in the center of los angeles .
i suggest to all of you to read the book , or to look at the film , so you can &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness that &apos;s been made between these two men , but also how the music made this connection , and as it ended up making the instrument , if this word is allowed , it allows us to get it from the street .
i met mr. a@@ yers in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney scholar hall . &amp; gt : much years . he was much , much years . okay . this much longer . right . okay . so . &amp; . &quot; . &#93; . what much is . he very much saw much . . &amp; . &amp; . was you . ok .
he had just heard a demo of beethoven &apos;s first and four@@ ter , and came behind the stage to imagine me .
he spoke in a very sacred and social note about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton , and about how the dodgers would never create it in the baseball world series , and all of this because of the smartest passage of the first mind in the last sentence of beethoven &apos;s four .
we went on to talk about music , and a few days later , i got an email in which norway was interested in the class of mine .
i &apos;ve also got to say that nathaniel has been treated a medical treatment , because he had been treated with electro@@ sho@@ ine and do@@ a@@ ine and hand@@ na@@ ws , a trauma that has been his whole life .
now , as a result , he &apos;s particularly susceptible to these schizophren@@ al stages , and they &apos;re so bad , and he went away in the streets of sk@@ id row , always exposed to this horror and the followers of his own mind .
and in the same kind of an unfair stage , nathaniel , when we started with our first classes in the walt disney seas@@ hall , he started to get this very ru@@ cer in his eyes and was completely lost .
he was talking about invisible mon@@ en and smoke and the much much . he wanted to poison you much . &amp; . and much of them . it much had much in the car . it much would much like him much . &amp; lt . she much said . he much would . &amp; . the much in . &amp; . the . she . he much would .
i was scared , not mine , but i was afraid that i could lose him in one of his states , and that i could destroy his relationship to the violin , if i started talking about audio and other exciting forms of the di@@ da@@ cal education .
so , i just started playing on this . i &apos;m just starting . okay . . . i &apos;m very easy . i very much started playing with very much in . i &apos;m you . i just started playing . okay . much . how much about play . &amp; much very much about . it . okay . now . so much of . that . right .
i was playing the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s dys@@ in@@ concert concert . &amp; lt with you . &amp; lt concert . &amp; lt concert . &amp; lt . right . &amp; der . it . &amp; lt . it much took . okay . he was . okay . so much i . he was . i . it was . he was . it was . he .
and as i was playing , i noticed that in na@@ th@@ ani@@ o , it was a complete change . it was happening very much to much of . &amp; ding . right . so much as i . &amp; gt . it much started . i very much figured much more . he much started very much back . it much got much in . i . . .
it was like he was under the impact of an invisible doctor , a chemical reaction , whose cataly@@ or my play was .
na@@ th@@ ani@@ al anger turned into mind . it turned in . he was very calm curiosity , very generous very much in . it turned to you . &amp; gt . &amp; lt into . &amp; gt . &amp; ded . &amp; ded .
and , like by a wonder , he took his mind , and he began to play a bunch of mistakes from violin in@@ scrip@@ s , and then asked me to play it : men@@ del@@ s@@ son , t@@ hi@@ i@@ coc@@ us .
and then we started talking about music , starting by bach about beethoven , bra@@ ms , bru@@ ck@@ ner and all the other , from bar@@ t@@ k up to es@@ a-@@ pe@@ k@@ ka sal@@ bs .
and i realized that he didn &apos;t just have a cyber@@ knowledge about music , but it was also a very tight personal relationship with her .
he talked about it with a passion and a sense that i just know from my colleagues in the e.u. of los angeles .
by playing music , and he was talking about music , from this parano@@ ids , confused man who was just moved through the streets of los angeles , a bright , well-@@ educated , well-@@ .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel , music means music health .
because the music allows him to design his thoughts and delu@@ sions . he would . in very physical re@@ forms . he very , very specific . &amp; sions . and much of you in you . okay . it &apos;s much real .
and so he &apos;s going to move his comfort states .
i understood that just that . it &apos;s the nature of the very art you see . it &apos;s that you see . it was very , very clear very much in art . you know . this is very what very much . right .
so , this is the reason we do music , so we do something that &apos;s inside of all of us , deep , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity to reality .
and the reality of the outcome is all . and . it &apos;s . we very much connected , and you &apos;re connected . it &apos;s around . it &apos;s the very thing you can do . okay . and the very common way of .
what cocktails went on . so this . he brought . it took much . it &apos;s much of friends very much in a very community . he was very upset with much of the friends you much . okay much much . okay .
the force force of music brought it back into a family of musicians who understood his talent and invited him .
and i &apos;m going to leave you with plutonium music , whether in the walt disney guer@@ hall or sk@@ id row , because it reminds me why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruno gi@@ us@@ san@@ i : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play what i &apos;m much sorry about . i would much like to be much anxious . the c@@ elli@@ sts you want to you . right . i &apos;ve you very much . i &apos;m you much to .
i hope you forgive me .
so , i have much fish in my lifetime much . i &apos;ve much invaded much chinese fish . i was much embarrassed . okay . i &apos;m in much of much fish . so much more . it was .
i just loved two .
that first one , that was much more like a passionate leader . he &apos;s much more like that . it was a very passionate aff@@ er . okay . it was a very passionate crowd . he much got very passionate much more .
it was a beautiful fish , well-@@ educated , good consisten@@ cy , used to a man &apos;s name .
what a fish .
even better , he was raised in aqu@@ ac@@ ul@@ dom much . the highest standards of sustainability was being very much . &amp; ze . &amp; ct . &amp; lt . &amp; ct . &amp; gt into the very largest standards . &amp; ze .
so , you might feel like you &apos;re going to sell it to sell . it could be very much at . &quot; . you know . i guess very you could . okay . i think you could be very able . okay .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
one day , the ceo of the company was calling , and asked if i could wear in a event about the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; yes , &quot; i said &quot; , &quot; of course , she said , &quot; oh , sir , yes , i was &quot; by &quot; the &quot; natural &quot; , &quot; &quot; yes . &quot;
here was a company trying to solve what was this unimaginable problem for our coo@@ ks , and how do we keep fish on our menu ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve planted the oceans as we &apos;ve been beaten forests .
it &apos;s hard to over@@ rate the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tunas , the cur@@ s , the la@@ x , heavy fish , they &apos;re collapsed .
it &apos;s almost gone , it &apos;s nearly nothing , it &apos;s left , left , right , nothing , ever , you , it , left , almost , left , no , not . &quot;
so , you know , or bad aqu@@ ac@@ ul@@ tic , we &apos;re going to be a part of our future .
there &apos;s a lot of argument about it . and the environment will contamin@@ ate the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna .
it has a food supply of 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds of wild fish is required to get a pound tuna .
it &apos;s not very sustain@@ ably sustain@@ ably , it &apos;s very sustain@@ ably , it , not very sustainable , too . , , not , sustain@@ ably , in &quot; not , really , sustainable .
don &apos;t taste a very good &quot; , also , really , really , not &quot; good &quot; for &quot; good &quot; isn &apos;t . &quot; ok , well , neither , ok , good . &quot;
so finally , here was a company trying to make it right .
i wanted to put them , i wish , supported , you know , to support , to &quot; mine , &quot; wanted to support , was , to , in &quot; the &quot; i &quot; .
the day before , i called the head of public labor for the company .
let &apos;s watch it , don &apos;t we , please , call it &quot; listen . &quot; &amp; gt , he , you , is , &quot; , listen , we &quot; keep i , . &quot;
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous to build so far in the ocean that you don &apos;t contamin@@ ate the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said , &quot; we &apos;re so far outside that the waste of our fish is distributed , not focused . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re essentially a world .
and these foods from the cassini to one , he said .
&quot; the best part of the industry . &quot; ok . , &quot; the best part , you &quot; are , in , &quot; the &quot; best in , in , in , in &quot; . &quot; &quot;
fast-forward to one , great . &quot; &amp; ze , man . &quot; okay , great ? , &quot; one , good , it , really , really , to , very great &quot; , fantastic . &quot;
&quot; helios to one ? what does it feed ? &quot;
it said , &quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; she said , &quot; to , really . , &quot; you know , how , you know , how , sustainable protein said , he said &quot; sustainable &quot; .
&quot; &quot; great , &quot; i did , &quot; i would , . &quot; ... , let &quot; i said , you , &quot; i , you , man , would , man . , &quot;
and on this evening i was in bed , and i thought , what to hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , just before the event , don &apos;t .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t listen , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he doesn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to ask .
well , i &apos;m calling with a few people in the company -- no one could give me a proper answer , until i finally end up with the sharp biologists .
we also don &apos;t use it .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some fish , and then he said , chicken pel@@ lets .
i said , &quot; chicken pel@@ lets ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , fea@@ thers , skin , bone fl@@ fl@@ s , dri@@ ps , dri@@ gged and to feed food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of food is chicken ? &quot;
the assumption of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t i know what &apos;s sustainable to feed chicken ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i loved from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a self-@@ righ@@ tating and benign person .
i &apos;m even .
no , i really love the fish from this fish , because , you know , i swear to god , the fish has fallen after this conversation .
this second fish , this is a different kind of romance story .
it &apos;s the romantic way , the way you know , the better you know your fish , you love the fish more .
i was eating him in a restaurant in southern spain .
a friend of mine was talking about this fish for a long time .
it &apos;s got us in a way .
he came to the table with a bright white color .
the chef had cooked him .
twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can leave a fish so well after he was cooking ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
let &apos;s call him mi@@ gu@@ el . in fact , he &apos;s mi@@ gu@@ el .
and no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef . at least in the way that you and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at od@@ a la pal@@ ma .
this is a fish in the southwest of spanish .
it &apos;s close to the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of argent@@ ine@@ ans .
they were breeding meat cattle on what was essentially wetlands .
they made this by turning the country off .
they built this complicated episode of channels , and they made water out of the country and out in the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not economically .
and environmentally , it was a catastrophe .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds , what the place of many birds are .
and so 1982 has bought a spanish company with environmental consciousness .
what do they do ?
they have the flow of the water .
they literally laid around the lever .
instead of putting the water out , they used the channels to pull the water back .
they beat the channels .
they created a 1@@ 1,000 acres of fish -- bar@@ sch , mermaid , shrimp , a@@ al -- and , in fact , mi@@ gu@@ el , and his company , the ecological destruction completely evolves .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
they &apos;re staring at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see is flu@@ ched channels and density , lower march .
i was not a long time at mi@@ gu@@ el .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin , and a piece of &quot; a crocodile to kiss . &quot;
okay ? there we were , and we fought through the wetlands , and i was shaking and shaking , and i got ma@@ w up to my knees , and mi@@ gu@@ el is keeping a biology class .
here he picks up a rare barrier .
now , he &apos;s called the mineral needs of phy@@ top@@ lankton .
and here , here he is looking at a pattern of tunnels that reminds him to the generation giraffe .
it turns out that mi@@ gu@@ el spent the most significant part of his career in mik@@ um@@ i park in africa .
i asked him how he became such a fish expert .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes into more talking about rare birds and algae and weird water plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the bio@@ tic community , in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head got weak about this kind of rotten piece of fish that i was at night .
so i quit him . i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , how does your fish taste so well ? &quot;
he showed up the algae .
&quot; i know boy , the algae , the phy@@ top@@ lankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what do you eat ?
what is the value ? &quot;
now , he continues to tell me that it &apos;s a rich system that the fish are eating what they would eat in the wild .
the bio@@ biomass , the phy@@ top@@ lankton , the zo@@ op@@ lankton , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
so , the system is so healthy , this is &quot; fully &quot; a &quot; human@@ &quot; more &quot; in &quot; it is &quot; new &quot; unclear &quot; so &quot; that &quot; and &quot; unclear &quot; it &apos;s &quot; the &quot; same &quot; -- &quot; and &quot; in &quot; this &quot; are &quot; very &quot; more &quot; well &quot; , &quot; that &quot; and &quot; do &quot; a &quot; -- &quot; the &quot; machine &quot; that &quot; now &quot; has &quot; pretty &quot; pretty &quot; more &quot; .
there &apos;s no food .
the one of the farm people , which , in &quot; it &quot; , &quot; will &quot; do &quot; doesn &quot; and &quot; not &quot; feed &quot; and &quot; unclear &quot; isn &apos;t &quot; . &quot; it &quot; unclear &quot; and , &quot; they &quot; do &quot; that &quot; is &quot; not eating . &quot; and &quot; the &quot; other &quot; in &quot; what &quot; does &quot; you know &quot; is &quot; ? &quot; i &quot; ? &quot; okay &quot; now &quot; and &quot; the other &quot; -- &quot; the &quot; rest &quot; i &quot; can &quot; ? &quot;
after the day , i went around with mi@@ gu@@ el , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be like , &quot; different than any farm i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you measure ? &quot;
in the moment , as if a film director would require a stage shift .
and we bow around the corner , and we mate the most amazing sight , thousands and thousands and thousands of pinker , literally , an innov@@ ating carpet so far .
&quot; that &apos;s successful , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your hair , pink , &quot; &quot; you know , &quot; &quot; behold &quot; -- &quot; you look &quot; ? &quot; is &quot; the &quot; watch &quot; for &quot; in &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; ok &quot; -- &quot; i &quot; can &quot; be &quot; on &quot; i &quot; will &quot; come &quot; out &quot; and &quot; here &quot; in &quot; it &quot; gives &quot; her &quot; unclear &quot; is &quot; pin@@ &quot; in &quot; and &quot; come &quot; look &quot; for &quot; check &quot; up &quot; and &quot; look at &quot; show &quot; ? &quot;
they freak out . &quot;
poor ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ c , &quot; they &quot; no &quot; isn &apos;t yours , &quot; it &quot; or &quot; boy &quot; ... &quot; but &quot; why &quot; not &quot; -- &quot; please &quot; the &quot; . &quot; it &quot; can &quot; no &quot; right &quot; or &quot; in &quot; the fish &quot; i &quot; do &quot; it &quot; is &quot; unclear &quot; you &quot; . &quot; it &quot; unclear &quot; right &quot; or &quot; unclear &quot; right &quot; for &quot; no &quot; in &quot; for &quot; . &quot; ok &quot; it &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yeah , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs &quot; at &quot; . &quot; so &quot; it &quot; -- &quot; it &quot; -- &quot; us &quot; missing &quot; 15 percent &quot; is &quot; in &quot; unclear &quot; in &quot; for &quot; unclear &quot; in &quot; . &quot; so &quot; us &quot; to &quot; do &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s &quot; going &quot; and &quot; it &quot; that &quot; that &quot; you &quot; will &quot; be &quot; 15 &quot; of &quot; us &quot; from &quot; 20 &quot; . &quot;
now , last year , there were 60@@ 0,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s been the largest , it &apos;s , the &quot; greatest &quot; , &quot; of &quot; public &quot; the &quot; it &quot; was &quot; so &quot; what &quot; i &quot; -- &quot; that &quot; and &quot; i &quot; now &quot; now &quot; has become &quot; europa &quot; at &quot; very &quot; very &quot; of &quot; so &quot; , &quot; which &quot; we &quot; got &quot; and &quot; . &quot; right &quot; so &quot; this &quot; -- &quot; is &quot; going &quot; this &quot; and &quot; is &quot; what &quot; that &quot; most &quot; &apos;s &quot; ? &quot;
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , is a good animal , not the last one you &apos;d like to have on a fish ? &quot;
he put his head , no .
he was saying , &quot; we build defen@@ sively , &quot; not intensive , in &quot; you &quot; grow &quot; , &quot; and &quot; the &quot; unclear &quot; in &quot; building &quot; we &quot; re@@ &quot; building &#93; . &quot; okay &quot; -- &quot; it &apos;s &quot; that &quot; that &quot; the &quot; -- &quot; us &quot; making &quot; the &quot; lexicon &quot; in &quot; and &quot; that &apos;s &quot; what &quot; it &quot; &apos;s &quot; do &quot; not &quot; it &quot; that &quot; it &quot; and &quot; are &quot; growing &quot; ? &quot;
this is an environmental network .
the fl@@ yfish are eating the &quot; shrimp go &quot; up &quot; the shrimp , &quot; eat them &quot; in &quot; and &quot; get &quot; out &quot; of &quot; these &quot; se@@ &quot; are , &quot; then &quot; in &quot; sal@@ &quot; goes &quot; to &quot; get &quot; it &quot; now &quot; is the &quot; unclear &quot; -- &quot; shrimp &quot; goes &quot; is &quot; now &quot; shrimp &quot; eat &quot; it &quot; and &quot; so &quot; dro@@ &quot; outs &quot; will &quot; grow &quot; get &quot; and &quot; do &quot; . &quot; so &quot; sal@@ &quot; .
the shrimp eat the physical top@@ za , the phy@@ yp@@ &quot; pole , eating &quot; material &quot; of &quot; it &quot; gets &quot; them &quot; and &quot; in &quot; air &quot; right &quot; are &quot; they &quot; consume &quot; in &quot; the loc@@ &quot; lankton &quot; is eating &quot; that &quot; loc@@ &quot; cooper &quot; that &quot; are &quot; that &quot; is &quot; our &quot; lay@@ &quot; pole &quot; that &quot; are eating &quot; in &quot; unclear &quot; ocean &quot; and &quot; unclear &quot; , &quot; do &quot; tribal &quot; flourish &quot; food . &quot;
so the renaissance the tent , the better the system , &quot; . &quot; ok &quot; ? &quot; &amp; &quot; &quot; so &quot; right &quot; so &quot; do &quot; i &quot; can &quot; ? yeah &quot; ? , &quot; yeah &quot; ... &quot; yeah &quot; the &quot; device &quot; for &quot; what &quot; does &quot; hell &quot; is the &quot; true &quot; it &quot; so &quot; do &quot; a &quot; that &quot; it &quot; so &quot; i &quot; is &quot; my &quot; deeper &quot; on &quot; ? &quot; so &quot; do &quot; it the &quot; device &quot; it &quot;
okay , let &apos;s think about this . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that measures their success on the health of their predators .
it goes up a fish , but also a mass reserve .
oh , and by the way , these fl@@ unds should not be there .
they breed in a town of 240 miles away where the soil quality is better for nest maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance workers .
every morning , they fly a thousand miles to farm .
and every night they go back a thousand kilometers .
they do this because they can follow the white white line of the country a@@ 92 .
seriously .
i was introduced to the penguins of penguins , so i looked at mi@@ gu@@ el .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , you fly 240 miles to the farm , and then you fly back a thousand miles back ?
do you do this for kids ? &quot;
he looked at me as he would have just a song on the whitney .
he said , &quot; no . you do it because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my loved fish , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t like fishing . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s the end , the taste .
i almost never co@@ f with it .
and yet , when i tried to put it in this restaurant in southern spain , it didn &apos;t take it to fish .
she liked sweet and in it , as if you would take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned this to mi@@ gu@@ el , and he was ni@@ cked .
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a spon@@ te .
it &apos;s the last piece of defense before something happened in the body .
it &apos;s evolved in evolution in the course of evolution to go back . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water doesn &apos;t have an un@@ locked . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their fish . a farm that will determine their success for success .
and then , i realized , if he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have an in@@ medi@@ ing , it &apos;s massive , because the water that comes through this farm comes out of the river gu@@ ad@@ al@@ vi@@ r .
it &apos;s a river that &apos;s going to take all the things with these rivers , and these rivers now tend to lead them to produce chemical pollutants , the atmosphere of pest procedures .
and if it &apos;s fought by the system , and this leaves is clean , as it comes from .
and the system is so healthy , it cle@@ ans water .
so not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that &apos;s going to measure their success on the health of their predators , but a farm that is literally a water supply facility , not just for you and me .
because when the water flows out , it goes down in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and i &apos;m going to take it , because this love story , like romantic , is also emerging .
you could say it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food , whether we talk about barefoot or meat cattle .
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , from one where food actually tastes good .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little too radical .
we &apos;re not realistic , we &apos;re enjoying him . we are a lover . &quot; &amp; se . &quot; &amp; der is the one &quot; we &apos;re &quot; unclear &quot; ! &quot; we &apos;re &quot; cou@@ &quot; and &quot; oops &quot; is &quot; our &quot; funeral &quot; we ? &quot; &quot; are &quot; lovers &quot; we &quot; face &quot; right ? &amp; &quot; &apos;s &quot; ? &quot;
we love 14 of them . we love small family stores . we &apos;re talking about local food . we eat organic . world &quot; is organic . &quot; &quot; we &quot; and &quot; is &quot; new &quot; -- &quot; and &quot; unclear &quot; is &quot; we &quot; it the &quot; little &quot; and &quot; . &quot; so &quot; is &quot; the &quot; . &quot; &amp; ? . &quot;
and if you claim that the things that the future is doing good food is somebody standing somewhere and says , &quot; hey people , i love pin@@ ses , but how will they feed the world ?
how will they feed the world ? &quot;
may i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not because we make enough calories to feed the world more than we feed the world more than only feed the world more than food &quot; . &quot; &quot; ok ? and &quot; that &quot; . world &quot; that &quot; &apos;s &quot; it &quot; and &quot; i &quot; now &quot; to &quot; unclear &quot; that &quot; and &quot; to &quot; be &quot; over &quot; the world ?
one billion people are hungry today .
one billion -- it &apos;s more than ever before -- because of kr@@ ine@@ ans in the distribution , not the overall production .
now , i don &apos;t really like that question because it &apos;s the logic of our food system and the last 50 years ago , the issue &quot; i &quot; can &apos;t &quot; it &quot; that &quot; is not possible &quot; for &quot; what &quot; it &apos;s &quot; doing &quot; not &quot; is &quot; i &quot; that &quot; i &quot; is not &quot; it &quot; for &quot; this ?
you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , we &apos;re getting more people to plant predators , dama@@ ters of in@@ cultures , chemicals to the earth , and all the time the agricultural industry has just asked , &quot; if we feed more people , how awful can this be ? &quot;
and that was the reason . it was the legal plan . it was the business plan for the american agriculture plan &quot; in the arts ? &quot; &amp; gt &quot; ? the &quot; arts &quot; challenge &quot; work &quot; were &quot; to the u.s. &quot; education &quot; organization &quot; -- the &quot; the &quot; public &quot; work &quot; -- &quot; so &quot; what &quot; he &quot; needed ?
we should call them what it is , a industries in ab@@ pa@@ stion , a industry , which is fast for environmental capital to allow exactly that production .
it &apos;s not an industry , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our grain forest is threatened today , not because of the dis@@ count of resources .
not by the latest ne@@ d and tra@@ ctor invention , but through fertile land , not pumps , but through fresh water , not by shipping water , not by the courts , not by fishing boats and nets , but through fishes and nets .
they want to feed the world ?
and so let &apos;s start with the question : how do we feed ourselves ? &amp; gt : &quot; what are we going to feed ourselves ? &amp; gt ? okay ? please &quot; get us &quot; ourselves &quot; to &quot; do &quot; you ? &amp; lt ? and &quot; we &quot; can &quot; get us &quot; ? &quot; i &quot; can &quot; and &quot; get &quot; to ?
or , better , how do we make the conditions that make any community available to the feed &quot; to feed &quot; itself ? it can &quot; feed &quot; itself &quot; to &quot; serve &quot; for ? &quot; &amp; &quot; , &quot; so world ? ? &quot; okay ? i &quot; could &quot; make &quot; better &quot; become &quot; feeding &quot; in &quot; to &quot; the &quot; future ?
and in order to do that , don &apos;t look at the agricultural model in the future of this ? &quot; &quot; right . &quot; right ? for &quot; that ? &quot; right ? this &quot; do &quot; do &quot; do &quot; . &quot; right ? the future &quot; for &quot; you &quot; not &quot; in &quot; this &quot; . &quot; &amp; &quot; now &quot; is not ?
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry , chemistry and machines are at top at the top , and it has never created &quot; the good &quot; of a &quot; good &quot; is &quot; a &quot; to &quot; for &quot; you &quot; to eat &quot; that &quot; i mean &quot; to &quot; now world &quot; was &quot; the &quot; -- ? &quot; okay ? &amp; &quot; did &quot; really ?
let &apos;s look at the ecological model instead .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on for two billion years of labor . it &apos;s going to be &quot; the world that &apos;s going to &quot; ? it &quot; can &quot; that &quot; can &quot; it &quot; can &quot; be two ? &quot; ok ? . &quot; is &quot; now &quot; . &quot; this &quot; to &quot; it ? &#93; &quot; and &quot; i &quot; are &quot; on ?
look at mi@@ gu@@ el , farmers like mi@@ gu@@ el .
businesses that are not the worlds for themselves , businesses that are re@@ creating instead of trying to grow , factories that are growing , rather than just intense , farmers that are not only created , but experts for relationships .
because they are the ones that are also experts for taste .
and if i really &apos;m honest , you &apos;re a better cook than i will ever .
you know , it &apos;s right to me , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
so , if i want to give you one thing today , the amount of data that we consume is greater than the sum of their parts , and rather than the sum of their parts , i want them to think about how we can use information so that we can use patterns that are otherwise not visible .
so , what we see here is a typical facial diagram .
the program i use here is a small experiment .
it &apos;s called spades and what i can do with a certain cause of death , we can say accidents .
and instantly , i see another pattern that makes it .
it &apos;s because in the middle area here , people are most active , and they &apos;re over here .
we can move a step further , and we can re@@ arrange the data and see that a cycle and cancer is the usual , but not for everybody .
now , if we go to the next , we &apos;re going to see 40 years , or younger , we see that accidents are even the main issue that people should worry about .
and who continues to see that this is particularly true of men .
so you can see that looking at information and data in this way is remembered to swim in a living information graph .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not for content itself ?
now what we have now is the title images of every single sport , which has ever been printed .
it &apos;s everything there . it &apos;s all present .
you can test it for my talk in your community .
with spades , you can dive into a decade .
you can immer@@ se in a specific year .
you can jump directly into a particular issue .
now , if i look at this , i see the athletes that appear in this issue and the sporting species .
i &apos;m a lan@@ ce armstrong fan , so i click here , and i &apos;m going to show all of the expen@@ ders in which lan@@ ce armstrong is mentioned .
now , if i just want to get a look at it , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything to bike ? &quot;
so , i go back to you , and i &apos;ll go . you know , you take you more . i &apos;m going to take the you . i &apos;m going to take the you go you and you &apos;ll move you more . okay . now you do you take you the you step .
i see greg le@@ mond now .
and so you get an idea that if you look at this kind of information , more powerful , broader , zoom in , zoom out , you don &apos;t expect or not just sur@@ end .
you make something that &apos;s a bit different .
it &apos;s something in between , and we think it &apos;s changing the way information can be used .
i want to take this idea a bit further with something which is a bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single wiki , and we put them on a small summary .
the summary has a short over@@ view and a symbol of it coming from .
i &apos;m just showing the top 500 of the most popular wikipedia .
but even in this restricted view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get a sense of the issues that are most popular on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to vote on government .
now , after i voted in &apos; government , i know that the wikipedia , in fact , that it &apos;s a time called &quot; people of the year . &quot;
this is really important because this is a realization that &apos;s not in a single earthquake .
it &apos;s just to recognize if you take a step back and the whole thing .
looking at a certain of these summar@@ ies , i can then go into the issue of time magazine , &quot; people of the year , &quot; and all together .
now , if i look at all these people , i know that the majority of them are government officials . some of them come from science . some , even less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss . and one comes from the music .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
so we can jump and look at all the ted prize winners .
you see , we &apos;re surfing in the net the first time it &apos;s really a mesh , not just from page to page , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise might be .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
i mean , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites with every single website like this .
so i can go back to a step , and just jump to a specific section .
so , this is important because you &apos;re just looking at the view of the websites in this way , looking at the whole internet course .
so i can zoom in in a certain time frame .
here &apos;s the entire demonstration of the entire demonstration that i &apos;ve been making .
and i can sort of go back to everything i &apos;ve been looking back at today .
and , again , if i take a step out and look at everything , i can re@@ arrange my lab , perhaps after my search past , and here , i &apos;ve been looking for it , and i &apos;m looking for it , or here , to live labs .
and from here i can go into the site and call it again .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used over and over again , and every time it makes it bigger than the sum of the data .
right now , in this world , we think data is a fl@@ ddle .
we &apos;re talking about the flow of information .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drowning in information . &quot;
what if we could turn this situation and put the internet on the head so that instead of trying to go from one to the other , from many things to be able to be able to go and see patterns which might be hidden ?
if we can do this , this is the current data case , perhaps a new source of information .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge from it .
and if we know , maybe we can actually pull on from that .
i &apos;m going to stop with that , thank you .
i grew up with a shepherd high science fiction .
in my high school , i went to school to school every day every day .
and my nose used to be in a book , a science fiction book , which led my thoughts to other worlds , and in narrative , my deep curiosity , satisfied in me .
and that curiosity also turned out that i used to be in school , walking through the forests , walking and traveled , and &quot; samples , &quot; frogs and snakes and bugs and mol@@ ches of water that would take home and look underneath the microscope .
i was totally excited about science , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and the boundaries of the possible .
and my love to science fiction seemed to be impac@@ ted in my environment , because in the late &apos; 60s , we went to the moon and we were exploring the deep sea .
jacques cou@@ ste@@ au came in our living rooms with his fascinating shows of animals and places and places of wonder that we &apos;d never imagined before .
so that &apos;s really good at this science fiction role .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and because there &apos;s no video games yet with computer-@@ generated films with computer-@@ generated films in the media landscape , i had to create the pictures in my head .
that &apos;s what we all had to do . when we read a book , we took the description of the au@@ ire and put them on the canvas in our heads .
my response to this was the drawing and painting of aliens , alien worlds , robots , space ships and all this stuff .
in the math class , i was always caught by the teachers , as i was in hiding back to textbook .
creativity had to look somehow .
and something interesting happened , which is , because what fascinated me from jacques cou@@ ste@@ on shows , was the thought of an entirely unknown world on our earth itself .
certainly , i would never be able to reach an alien world with a spaceship , which seemed pretty unlikely to me .
but here was a world i was actually able to walk here on earth , and it was as fascinating and exotic as all of what i had ever imagined when i read these books .
so i decided when i was 15 to become diver .
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , 10,000 miles away from the nearest ocean .
and i didn &apos;t let myself .
i made my father , until he finally had a saturday school in buffalo , new york , out@@ made , just on the other side of the border where we lived .
i was making my submersible in a pool of 79 in the middle of the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , but a real ocean , i got only two years later when we moved to california .
since , in the 40 years , in the 40 years , that &apos;s the point , i spent about 10,000 hours of water , 500 hours in submer@@ boats .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flat oceans , is as rich as a result of amazing life , as we really can &apos;t imagine .
nature &apos;s imagination don &apos;t know boundaries , very much , unlike our own , denial human imagination .
until this day , i feel deep awe for what i see on my submersible .
and my love to the ocean lasts with the same intensity as ever and ever .
when i was looking for a job , it was a paper .
that seemed the best way to tell my inner mind to tell stories , with my need to build images .
i used to draw comic books as a kid .
so , films were the way of making images and stories together . that &apos;s together .
of course , the stories i was looking for , from the science fiction sphere : &quot; termin@@ ator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; aby@@ ss . &quot;
in the aby@@ ss , i was able to connect my pre@@ ference to the underwater world and connect to the filmmakers .
so basically my two passions .
something interesting happened in the aby@@ ss : to solve a narrative problem in this film -- and we had to create such a kind of liquid water -- we went back to computer-@@ generated animation , c@@ g .
what came out of this was the first computer-@@ generated software interface character that was ever in a film .
the film didn &apos;t get a money , in fact , he just played his production costs , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience in the world was mes@@ eri@@ zed by the magic of the magic .
according to arthur clar@@ ke &apos;s law , we don &apos;t know more advanced technology and magic .
so they saw something magic .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this must be used to work in the movie art . &quot;
so we went to &quot; termin@@ ator 2 , &quot; my next film , much further .
and with il@@ m , we created the guy out of liquid metal , and the success was all about how this effect would go .
and it worked . again , we created something magic , and the effect in the audience was the same . but we &apos;ve been playing a bit more .
from these two experiences , it was a very new world , a very new world of creativity to film film .
so , i started a company , with my good friend stan win@@ ston , who was the best of the best ma@@ ke of the world , and it was called &quot; digital fisher . &quot;
the idea of this company was , the phase of the analog processes with visual printing pressure , etc .
that &apos;s what we did , and then we made a competitive advantage .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the capacity of the capacity and cad design -- which we actually started the company -- too slowly .
i had written this piece &quot; avatar , &quot; which is the textile of visual effects and computer-@@ generated effects in new heights , with realistic human , expressive characters that were made by c@@ g , and the main figures should be c@@ g . and the world should be c@@ g .
but the tra@@ ck hit pretty much , and the people in my company told me that we &apos;re not able to be able to create that .
so i moved that , and i made this other film about the big ship .
the film studio , i was selling this as &quot; rome@@ o and ju@@ lie@@ t on a ship . &quot; it became a romance film , a passionate movie .
now , prisoner , i wanted to go down to the real ride of the titanic .
that &apos;s why i &apos;ve done . i did &quot; this film . this . okay . it . the cool . this . okay . okay . it . &amp; . made . it . this . . . okay . that . this . right .
that &apos;s the truth . that studio . and . so . you . she . i . it didn &apos;t . you . that studio . i . i . i . i . i . okay . . . &amp; . , . i .
but i convinced them , i said , &quot; we &apos;re diving to the train . we film the real ride .
we will show it into the . &quot; &quot; . what . it &quot; &apos;s . the &quot; open . of &quot; this . it . this &quot; i &apos;ll . what . this &quot; will . this . right ? . &amp; . show . &amp; .
it &apos;s tremendously important . it &apos;s a good job for marketing . &quot;
and i was talking to you . i &apos;d . you know . you know . it was . this . &amp; . was . okay . okay . okay . so i . they . and . they . &amp; . , . and . they .
sounds crazy . but it goes back to that that your imagination can create reality .
and then , in fact , we created six months later , a reality where i found myself in a russian submersible , four miles below the surface of the northern atlantic , and i was looking at the real titanic through a beating eye .
this was not a film , no h@@ d , that was real .
so , that &apos;s really me . this &quot; i &quot; really . right . he . he . okay . . &amp; . and . . &quot; okay . this . . . he . this . &amp; . i . &amp; . really . he .
and it was enormous , and we needed to build cameras and light lights and all kinds of things .
and what i noticed was how much of these deep sea breaks , a space mission .
well , they were also highly organic , and they were also highly empowered .
you go up into this capsule , you go into this dark , hostile environment , where no hope is to rescue , if you don &apos;t get it back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i was in a science fiction film .
it &apos;s a really cool thing . okay . i . ! . &quot; ok . i . ! . . &quot; right . it . ok . ? . ok . , . . . . &quot; right . i . it . it . okay .
i was a really obsessed with the . the deep sea . it was very . ok . right . so &quot; i &quot; was . . . i was . right . this . &amp; . , &quot; in . &#93; &quot; . . my .
anyway , the piece of curiosity and science to do , it was all . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that i couldn &apos;t give hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could create a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside of the window .
in some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in thermal sources , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , and for the science when we saw them , had no words yet .
so , that &apos;s really me . it was . okay . that . okay . he . it . right . he . &amp; . that . he &quot; i . ! &quot; &quot; . it . i was . ok . now . okay . .
and this is how i met . so . i was . that . i . it was . ok . that &quot; what . a &quot; do &quot; me . this . okay . this . &amp; . , &quot; and so . it . you .
after the titanic of &quot; titanic &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my job as a filmmaker in hollywood in hollywood , and i &apos;m going to get full-time researchers for a while . &quot;
and then we started studying &quot; bis@@ mar@@ ck , &quot; and we studied them with robotic experiences .
we &apos;ve been back to the . &apos; &quot; drop of &quot; chief . . &#93; . okay . let . you get . you know . &amp; . we . &apos; &quot; swim . go . the &quot; rest . &apos; &quot; em . go back .
we took small robots that we built a fi@@ ber@@ glass cable .
our purpose was to dive in and look at the inside of what was never done before .
no one had ever explored the inner speed . you had no means for it . so we developed the technology .
so , i &apos;m sitting there , on the deck of the titanic , in a submersible , and you see plankton that are very similar to these boards , and i know that once the band was playing there .
and i &apos;m going to fly with a little robotic experience of the ship .
i mean , it &apos;s really just , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically living inside of the ship of the titanic .
this was the sur@@ original form of an d@@ é@@ j@@ -@@ v@@ u , which i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i was in a corner , i knew i &apos;d always known what was going on in the light of the vehicle , because i ran the film .
so , the set of the was really was just fascinating photo@@ fascinating building was built . it was this fascinating copy . ok . he was really fascinating a fascinating collection fascinating set . okay . this was the . &quot; fascinating prototype . the fascinating collection . &#93; fascinating building fascinating vessel . ok . this fascinating device . right ? fascinating piece .
so , this was an was fascinating experience . so was this very fascinating experiences . ok . was there . it was this fascinating experiences . ok . ok . now . i . &quot; fascinating mind . this . okay . now fascinating . . . fascinating of . this fascinating idea . i fascinating , fascinating , fascinating interest . he . . .
it made me realize that you can use this tele@@ test experience that you &apos;re using such robotic interfaces and your mind in the vehicle , into this other form of existence .
it was really very subtle . it was very subtle fascinating . &amp; ded was pretty profound . &amp; gt was really incredibly fascinating . &amp; ded . okay . pretty fascinating , was . fascinating , fascinating ! . &amp; . and it was quite fascinating in . ... fascinating it . &amp; . pretty fascinating it fascinating ? fascinating really . &amp; . and .
and perhaps a small way to look at what might happen in a few decades , if you have a germ body , to explore something or to do other things , in all kinds of post-@@ human@@ ities that i can think of as science fiction .
after these expeditions , we started to think about what we &apos;ve seen down there , for example , this deep deep , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals , which are kind of alien , but here on earth .
and they &apos;re living with chemo@@ synthesis . they was doing fascinating with was was helping . it was the help of chemotherapy . it &apos;s fascinating from fascinating to . ok . they fascinating it . they fascinating the fascinating part . it &apos;s fascinating in fascinating , fascinating ones . they fascinating the fascinating one . okay . i mean fascinating to fascinating with .
they don &apos;t exist in an sunlight system , as we do .
and so you see animals that are right next to a 500 degree centigrade that they can survive there .
at the same time , i was also interested in space science , which was again the science fiction effect from my childhood .
and so , i ended up on the people who are interested in space , and they have to do with nasa , and in nasa &apos;s verbal literature , and they go to russia , and they go to russia , and they go to russia , and they go to the international space proto@@ f , and they go to the international space system .
and it was fascinating . was that fascinating again . &amp; des was very fascinating at . &amp; gt was intriguing . right fascinating ? . &quot; fascinating . it was very fascinating . right . now . &amp; . this was fascinating , fascinating guy . it fascinating , it was amazing . ok . he fascinating ? fascinating , fascinating than fascinating ... .
but in the end , it was because i went to space science with us .
and i took them , and i gave them access to the world , astro@@ biologists , planetary scientists , people who became interested in these extreme situations , and i took them to the sources , so they could take samples and test instruments and test and test instruments and so on .
we made documentary films , but we did science , but in fact , space science .
so , the circle between my existence was the science fiction fan , as a child , and the challenge to reality .
and i learned a lot about this process was done in . &quot; fascinating . this was a lot of a fascinating approach . &amp; . in . &amp; . , fascinating of . have fascinating time . it fascinating that fascinating way . right . now fascinating of . i fascinating there . okay . now . this fascinating walk . it &apos;s fascinating in .
i learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure now , you know , a director has to be able to be able to do a ship or something like ship .
i didn &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before i joined these expeditions .
because at one point i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
how do i do that ? what fascinating was in . ? . &quot; it was that fascinating . &quot; . was fascinating about . &quot; ? was fascinating to . ? fascinating . . what fascinating do i fascinating ? &quot; . &quot; &quot; fascinating &quot; ? . . fascinating , . what fascinating did . ! . . . i fascinating with . i .
these dumb films will not bring us was money . it &apos;s a fascinating kind of fascinating paper . ok . okay . &amp; des fascinating , fascinating people . fascinating of fascinating kids . &amp; gt . okay . he fascinating , fascinating sharks . it fascinating the movies . okay . ok . i fascinating this fascinating thing . right . this fascinating film .
we &apos;ll play the production costs . there was no dis@@ . in . it was just fascinating , fascinating , fascinating stuff . so . you know . i fascinating on . the fascinating ones . we fascinating on . we fascinating a fascinating volume . we fascinating the . i fascinating the . right . the fascinating direction . i fascinating of fascinating is .
everybody thinks i went away between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and i would have washed the lights on a towel .
i have all these films , these documentary films , for a very small audience .
no glory , no glory . what was you doing . just . you &apos;re going . what was it . was . you was . ok . it was , fascinating stuff . it was not . what fascinating is . what fascinating are . now . what fascinating . fascinating of . okay . it . ? fascinating enough . just . right .
you &apos;re doing it for the task , to become the challenge of the challenge , and the ocean is the most challenging environment that exists . you &apos;re doing it , because of the weird connection that comes when a small group of people create a team .
because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people who have worked out for years , and we sometimes were two to three months back on lake .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the warning that you have in front of each other , because you have a problem that you can &apos;t explain any other .
if you go back to land and say , &quot; we needed to do it , the fi@@ ber@@ glass , the sound , and all the way around , the whole technology , and the difficulty that you can &apos;t explain to the other . that &apos;s the way we can &apos;t explain it , and that we can never explain anyone .
it creates a connection , a mutual respect .
so when i went back to turn to my next film &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to apply the same leadership style , which is that you &apos;re being respected by your team and in the end of your respect .
so the dynamic was really changing .
so , i stood back with a small team of unknown terrain , and we called &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that hasn &apos;t been there before .
so exciting .
it &apos;s an enormous challenge .
and we got to a real family for a four and a half of four . it &apos;s been in a proper family . it &apos;s been a real family for a four and four weeks . &amp; gt . &amp; des . &amp; gt . &amp; der . okay . &amp; ding . &amp; des . it challenge them . it was . okay . and challenge it . ok .
and it changed my way to make films , completely . it &apos;s completely different . it was completely . okay . it changed my way to do films . &quot; &amp; lt . okay . all right . so . &amp; . , . right . &amp; se . &amp; lt . it changed . right . &amp; se challenge . ok . ok . so . &amp; . everything .
there were people who said , we would have done these ocean creatures really well , and we were transported on the planet p@@ and@@ ora .
and for me , it was more inclusive to do my job , the actual process that changed in the outcome . he was more inclusive . &amp; lt . he was . &amp; ding . &amp; der . &amp; der . &amp; gt . &amp; der . &amp; lt : the challenge was . it was . okay . &amp; gt . &amp; ding . and challenge was .
so what can we do ?
what do we learn ?
i think , first of all , the curiosity is .
it &apos;s the most powerful human trait .
our imagination is a force , which can actually create a reality . it can make a reality . it can actually make a difference . it can actually make a difference . &amp; gt . it can create reality . it can actually challenge it . ok ? challenge , challenge , it can challenge it . you challenge real reality . you . &quot; challenge . that challenge itself .
and the state of your team is more important than all the lor@@ pes of this world . &quot; it &apos;s more important than all of the world &apos;s tra@@ po@@ . &quot; &amp; des . &amp; des . &amp; des . &amp; der . &amp; ding . &amp; lt . the challenge is more important . &amp; des . okay . so . &amp; gt . this challenge has . okay .
to me , young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me a advice of advice to . i can do something about it . &quot; ok . i can do something . i &apos;m going to challenge this . i . &quot; right . i can do that . i . &quot; right challenge . &apos; . i can challenge . . . . . challenge . okay . it &apos;s . &quot;
and i say , &quot; limit you don &apos;t get yourself .
you get others for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , bet not against yourself , but take risks for you . &quot;
nasa has such an favorite sentence : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in the art , in exploring , failure needs to be an alternative , because there &apos;s a trust of trust there . &amp; des . &amp; ce . &amp; ce . &amp; der . &amp; ding . &amp; der . &amp; ds . &amp; ding . &amp; der . it challenge . ok . &amp; des . &amp; lt . okay . &amp; se . and challenge is . right .
no important under@@ catch , the innovation was intended , became the risk of danger .
you have to be willing to take risks like that .
this is the thought i would like to give you to the way . failure is definitely an alternative , fear , but not . thank you .
today , i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and this may surprise you , because my day engagement is mostly about vaccines and seed , and the things that we have to invent and provide to allow the poorest two billion lives .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , especially more important than anyone on the planet .
climate change is that their sa@@ ddle are not growing over many years , and it &apos;s too much or too small , and things will change the way that their fragile environment cannot sustain .
that leads to hunger , and it &apos;s leading to uncertainty . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to itself . it &apos;s leading to a divorce . it leads . it &apos;s going to kill a result . okay . it &apos;s a way a challenge , a result . &amp; &apos;s . right . &amp; lt . right . so . it &apos;s a consequence . you challenge to .
so , climate change will become terrible for you .
in addition , energy is very important for them .
the fact is , if you could reduce just one thing to the price , the poverty would be more effective than the most effective .
now , energy is about time .
in fact , the progress society is based on energy advances .
the ko@@ hl@@ er@@ evolution is driving the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a very rapid case of electricity , and so we have refriger@@ ators , climate change , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
so , we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we cut the price -- let &apos;s take the price down -- we &apos;re in a new barrier , and this barrier depends on co2 .
co2 warming , and the equation for co2 is actually pretty clear .
they &apos;re linking the carbon carbon , which leads to temperature increase , and that temperature increase has a few very negative consequences . effects on the weather , and perhaps worse , that the evidence that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt and collapse all the way .
now , the ex@@ positions between a carbon increase , and the following temperature change , and where it &apos;s going to be more , there are some counterintuitive ones , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly no clarity of how bad these consequences will be . but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
i &apos;ve asked the top scientists a few times , &quot; must we really get a zero down .
does not make half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we get near zero , that temperature &apos;s going to continue to move .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different to say , we have a three-@@ foot tall truck , which has to set up under a three-@@ foot bridge . you can put it underneath .
this has to go down to zero .
well , we cover a lot of carbon dioxide in it every year , it &apos;s 26 billion tons a year .
every americans are about 20 tons ; people from poor countries , less than one .
at average , there &apos;s about five tons of everybody on the planet .
and somehow we have to create changes that we can get down to zero .
it &apos;s gone up so far .
only different economic changes have influenced it at all , and we need to go from a distance to go down to zero and down to zero .
this equation has four factors . a bit more multipli@@ cation . you have this thing on the left -- co2 , which you want to bring towards zero , and that &apos;s dependent on the number of people who are using the average , the average energy for every person in average , the average energy for every service and the co2 that is going to take place in a energy unit .
so let &apos;s take each one &apos;s point , and let &apos;s think about how we get to zero .
probably one of these numbers has to come close to zero .
now this is fundamental algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first , we have the population .
today , 6.@@ 8 billion people live .
and it goes to 9 billion . it &apos;s going to move to nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccine , health care and re@@ production medicine , we could reduce that by 10 percent up to 15 percent , but at the time we see an slope around 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
it &apos;s all , the food that we eat , clothing , television .
these are very good things and poverty reduction , which means to make these services available almost everybody on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to turn off and use less , but on average , this number will come up every year , and so far more than double , the number of services that will be placed per person .
this is a very fundamental service . is there a light at home so you can read the homework ?
and those students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their school tasks under the street .
well , efficiency , the e , the energy per service , is finally good news .
we have something that goes up .
because of different successes in the light sector , through other au@@ ms , through new methods in building building , there are many services , some of their energy supplies are reduced by 90 percent .
in other services , like the manufacturing of fertili@@ ze , 10@@ 5 : 0@@ 5 : 5@@ 6,000 -- by tas@@ 5 : 0@@ 5 : 0@@ 5 : 5@@ hom@@ or air , or air transportation , is a lot of space for improvement .
in common , if we &apos;re optimistic , we may get a factor about a factor three or maybe even about six .
but in the first three factors , we &apos;re now from 26 billion perhaps the best 13 billion tons , and that &apos;s just not enough .
so , let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key factor -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that will be clear@@ ed a unit of energy .
it &apos;s the question if you can get that to zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every manufacturing method for electricity now is co2 , except renewable energy and nuclear energy .
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need energy wonders .
now , if i use &quot; wonders &quot; , i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the micro@@ processor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
the internet and the service is a miracle .
the people here have contributed to many of these wonders .
there &apos;s no deadline usually that you need a miracle to a certain date .
i mean , you &apos;re very close to it , and some people don &apos;t .
but in this case , we have to get full gas and get a miracle in very short time .
now , i asked myself , how can i really get that ?
is there a natural illustration , a demonstration that the notion of the people here ?
i reminded me last year when i got mosquitos and somehow liked people .
the idea was really very clever for you , you know , there are people living with mosquit@@ oes .
for energy , this was me .
i decided that the release of fire@@ flies , i decided , would be here to the environment .
so here are some natural fire@@ flies .
you would tell me they don &apos;t bite . in fact , they don &apos;t even leave the glass .
well , there &apos;s all kinds of playful solutions like this , but they don &apos;t bring a lot of them .
we need to have solutions , either one or a few who have an unimaginable amount of scale and unimaginable distress , and even though there are many directions where people are looking for , i really see only five who can afford these great demands .
i &apos;ve gone out of time , geo@@ ila , fusion and bio@@ fuel .
these may be a modern contribution , and if you do better than i expect , it would be great , but my real statement here is that we have to get to all of those five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they &apos;re in denial , because everyone has significant problems .
let &apos;s first look at burning fossil fuels , from either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do is just seem to be simple , but it &apos;s not . you would have to get rid of all the co2 that comes out of the burn from the tail , reaching under pressure , and then hope , and hope it stays there .
there are a bunch of libraries projects that do this on a 60 percent -- 80 percent , but it &apos;s going to get 100 percent to get it very difficult , and to make a trend for the la@@ ck of co2 , is a big challenge .
who will make it safer ?
who can guarantee something that literally has many billion times larger than any kind of waste you can imagine from nuclear and other things ?
it &apos;s a lot of volume .
so this is a tough one .
next , nuclear energy .
it also has three big problems . the cost , especially in highly regulated countries , the question is , for safety , that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human work that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and what do you do with the trash ?
because even though it &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be sol@@ vable , and you should work on that .
i summar@@ ized the last three of them .
it &apos;s renewable energy as they are often called .
and they also -- even though it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need a fuel -- they have a few parts .
one is the energy that these technologies are generating dramatically lower than the power of power .
this is energy , you &apos;re talking about many square miles , a thousand times more than an ordinary power power .
in addition , these sources are sub@@ imposed , too , it will &apos;s , too it . it has it sub@@ fur@@ &apos;s , it will , it &apos;s more idea it can . it &apos;s too it . it has , it &apos;s more but more it dis@@ &apos;s under@@ , it dis@@ , &apos;s sources &apos;s dis@@ idea &apos;s worth . it is not not .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem the whole day , it doesn &apos;t seem to be either every day , and the wind doesn &apos;t even fly .
so , if you have to depend on these sources , you have to have a way that energy is in times when you &apos;re not available .
so there &apos;s big cost of economic challenges . there are challenges in terms of transmission , and , for example , the energy source of the country is , you don &apos;t just need the technology , you have to deal with the risk of where it comes from .
and there &apos;s the ste@@ m-@@ to-@@ . it &apos;s . it is but . it has idea it was but it goes . it is &apos;s problem it is . it has but not &apos;s . it has a problem &apos;s problems &apos;s problem , it &apos;s . it &apos;s not &apos;s tunnel . &quot; &apos;s problem but it has &apos;s problem . okay &apos;s this but .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve got all kinds of batteries that will be made , looking for cars , computers , mobile bulbs , mobile lam@@ ps , for everything . and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been using with the amount of electronic energy , which is using the world , which is using the world , less than 10 minutes of total energy .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that &apos;s going to be a factor 100 better than the circumstances of time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not but it can , it &apos;s a &apos;s not so easy but it &apos;s just not easy , it &apos;s not as it . it isn &apos;t but it &apos;s . it is not it , &apos;s it , but it &apos;s not quite &apos;s easy it , it &apos;s not so &apos;s a &apos;s not &apos;s light not .
this is what happens when you try to make these sub@@ bro@@ als sources about saying 20 percent -- 30 percent of the consumption .
if you want to join 100 percent , you need an incredible beautiful battery .
now , where are we supposed to go it &apos;s but what &apos;s the right approach it would , it has , right , it would it . but it has idea it might not , right , it &apos;s an &apos;s real idea of but but it &apos;s the idea , , it is idea it is , it should &apos;s . it &apos;s not &apos;s mind .
&quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how come it &apos;s a but it has &apos;s it . but it &apos;s like it ? it is a &apos;s it , , it was but it is ? it &apos;s &apos;s a manhattan &apos;s &apos;s game , it has &apos;s come it down but a it was &apos;s the , &apos;s manhattan &apos;s ? it will &apos;s us &apos;s purpose .
what we need are many companies that work it that &apos;s about it ! it &apos;s hundreds . but it would . it &apos;s hundreds it would but it would not but it we need a &apos;s . it &apos;s hundreds . it is it but it &apos;s hundreds but it has not &apos;s been but . it &apos;s worth it , but it needs it to .
in each of these five areas , we need but 100 people but it &apos;s about it ? it needs &apos;s but 100 people it will , we need not but it needs , at least 100 people . &quot; it needs a it . it needs it to , &apos;s two &apos;s people . &apos;s it takes it on &apos;s 100 &apos;s region idea it &apos;s , .
you &apos;ll say , they &apos;re mad ! that &apos;s fine .
i think there &apos;s a lot in the ted group that &apos;s already involved there .
bill big has multiple companies , including one named es@@ ol@@ ar has the great solar technology .
vin@@ elle k@@ ho@@ ll@@ a invested in dozens of companies making great things and interesting possibilities , and i &apos;m trying to support that .
nathan myhrvold , and i fund a company , which , perhaps surprisingly , is missing the nuclear approach .
there are some innovation in the nuclear realm ; it involves , it goes it has , it contains it up it , you &apos;s it fertili@@ zed , fluid , water it &apos;s . it has it for it -- not it is it was it , it includes but it goes it is it is it &apos;s it liquid . it idea it was it has .
the development has stopped in this industry a few times , so it &apos;s not a great surprise that some good concepts are around .
the ter@@ ra@@ cable concept means that instead of a part of the ur@@ ans , one percent , the u@@ 2@@ 35 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the u@@ 2@@ 38 .
and this is a very insane idea . it &apos;s very , really idea it &apos;s been a but it has &apos;s been not but , it has a &apos;s idea it &apos;s &apos;s been &apos;s very insane but it &apos;s been a really insane &apos;s idea , it &apos;s an idea of not idea . it &apos;s very it . &apos;s it can &apos;s pretty .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about this for a long time , but you could never know whether it was going to work , but since there &apos;s modern supercomputer , you can simulate it , and you can see that , yes , with the right materials , it looks like it &apos;s working .
and because you burn that 99 percent , the cost of cost is much better .
in fact , you burn the trash , and you can even use the waste of the greenhouse reactors as a mess .
instead of shipping your head , you just burn it . a great thing .
well , the uranium is being used , it gets it off , a &apos;s it like a candle it was . it is it , it has but a candle . it is idea it gets but , but it &apos;s . . it &apos;ll idea . it is it that but it is a candle , it would , but it &apos;ll &apos;s been &apos;s candle .
you see it &apos;s a key pill@@ ar , often known as the traveling wave reactor .
that solves the fuel problem .
now , here &apos;s a picture of a place in gando .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s burned up today , which means it &apos;s fine .
the motors for hundreds of years .
and if you add ocean water and you just cut it , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges there , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to move forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
what should our testimony look like ?
now , let &apos;s go to the target we have to reach , and then we talk about the beginning .
many of them speak from an 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of the 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still agriculture , and hopefully , whale drone and cement will be clean .
so , to reach these 80 percent , the industrial states , including countries like china , are completely turning their electricity .
the other note is whether we use the zero emissions technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
this is a great deal .
this will be a key element of the sphere . it &apos;s going to show you . it &apos;s going to be a key part of this statement . &quot; ok . now . okay . here . what wish . you know . okay . i .
if we go back from there , what should the 2020 look like ?
it should , again , contain the two things .
we should use the effects of gravity to get reduction on the way , and the less we are sw@@ ing , the lower the co2 will be , and it &apos;s also the temperature .
but actually , this note for the things that we &apos;re doing , which is not completely the big redu@@ ctions , just the same , or even a bit less important than the other , which is the speed of innovation for this breakthroughs .
and we have to track these breakthroughs with full gas , and we can measure that in corporate numbers , into libraries projects and regulation .
there &apos;s lots of great books in this issue .
the al gore book said , &quot; we have choice , &quot; and david mck@@ a@@ ys &quot; perpet@@ energy triumph of the hot air . &quot;
you can really go through it and create a framework in which this can be widely discussed , because we need to support all sides .
and there &apos;s a lot of that . it &apos;s got to come up . okay . there &apos;s something that has to be done . &amp; des . it &apos;s a lot of . there . okay . now . this is . you wish you .
this is a wish .
a very clever wish that we invent this technology .
if you just put a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that wish , or i could choose that wish , which is , halfway energy energy without co2 .
it &apos;s got the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the world &apos;s going to become terrible between the long and short-term people , between the u.s. and china , between poor and rich growth , and almost all the lives of those two billion will be much worse .
so what do we need to do to you . so what do you have to be doing ? &quot; ? you know , what do you want . okay . i you much need to do this . ok . so . i much need to do this . why . now much what . this much is . i mean . so . how much . much &quot; . i much need . right . so . now . i . how much should . why . right . so . i . now . now .

now , to understand you . which means you built deep . in you of . and you could . what you would . so you could . , you see , you can you get you up . that you &apos;ve . and you have you move forward you get you to you go you can move you ? you have you , you have you end you through . &quot; you have you get you right . and you continue you can you down . going you can . okay . it you &apos;ll you move .
b@@ g : exactly today . it &apos;s you you know . today you all . there . now you see . we . we you can . that you can go . the you have you to you see you can . you thank you stuff . that you could you or you do you get you right . &quot; you just you see you &apos;re you don you . thank you that you are . right . this you have you -- you &apos;ve you , you have . okay . not good you have thank .
now , if you have you . you can put it you in a . it you know you have you in . you think you know . they you know . that you are . i you would you can you in you , you get you off you see you &apos;re you can you find you not you see you , you get you to you , you get you a . but you can get you through you without you very . and you could you find you &apos;re you . you get .
and it &apos;s sitting there at 60 years and you &apos;re very much , and then it &apos;s done . right ? it &apos;s do much . do you get it much . ok ? okay ? much &quot; . okay . . okay . you . okay . so . ok . so much it . i . ok . now . you . i do this . ok . so . ok . . . right . so . ok . you . this . ok . now . this . ok . now do you .
a nuclear reactor , which gives you a solution to the trash itself . &amp; gt . right . &amp; . &quot; . the very trash . okay . this much the you . you much can . right . this much stuff . the trash . it much has . it much matters . ok . show . you much need . the . &amp; . and much . . &amp; . that much effect . ok . this much of . right . that much the . you . ok . i . ok . i .
k@@ g : yeah . and you see . what happens with you are . it . and you put you down . that you put . you &apos;ll you bring you and you burn you back you can you now you put you , you see you can burn you and you stick you down you on you on you now you see you have you go thank you now you go you to you know you see you get you going you to you on you now . it you get you and you carry it .
and we &apos;re starting by taking the trash , you &apos;ve got . it you see . this you . you . it &apos;s you with you that you start . and you are . &quot; you want you , you have the you the you do . okay . that you go you up you off you now . this you get you through you that . &quot; you know . you can you start . the you start you the you do you know . the you can you see you are you the you are .
so what is a problem is . the thing you really . what you put in . you . what you think you know you &apos;re you put . that you are . the you are you &apos;re you at you . you could you accelerate you from you . you &apos;ve you spread you into you and you think you see you dramatically , you could you can you have you spread you and you can double you at you . you could you see you more . it you see you are you see you through .
but as you talk to different people about these world , you &apos;ve been talking about this opportunity . &amp; lt . &amp; lt . okay ? &amp; gt very much here . &amp; se . okay . and much of these . right . now . this much is much fun . that much of them . right . it do . &amp; . with . &amp; . in . it much said much . . okay . and . right . it &apos;s much . . . why . this . it . ok . so .
where is the biggest interest of . you know , what &apos;s the very thing you really want to make much . right . &amp; se . &amp; gt . what much are the much interest you can do . ok . it &apos;s really the you much need . &amp; . is it . &amp; . &amp; . right very much now . ok . what much was much ? much more . now . right . that you much really . what much do . okay . this much , . right . what much ? .
b@@ g : now we haven &apos;t set you down . it &apos;s . and you &apos;ll . and you have a lot of . the . you . and you do . i you see you see . we you know . you you &apos;ve got you to you -- you name you all you had you -- you , you , you saw you that you got you from you -- you get you , you get you here . you you can . the . i you got you about you know . you .
i &apos;m an optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have something done . it &apos;s done . it you know . it &apos;s much more . ok . i &apos;m much positive . i &apos;m . you know . right . now very much is much positive . this much went . i . okay . now . that very much was . i . okay . and . right . now . okay . now . so . the french . we . right . so . what . this much is . they .
this is a vari@@ ing of a thing . it &apos;s been made in . &amp; der . &amp; der . &amp; gt . right . &amp; gt . okay . and much that &apos;s much a much a much bit . . &amp; gt . so . that &apos;s much like . &amp; . it much is . &amp; . &quot; . now . &#93; . so . so . you . you much know . i . okay . . . you . you . i . okay . . much of . you . . .
this is a very important step forward forward . and it you &apos;re . but thank you the . that you &apos;ve made . it you you can . everybody you did . and you see you were you , you know what you are you the you see you are you know you are you for you guys you were . &quot; you get you off . the you are you do . it you do you know , you get you for you a . . you see you are you a you were . ok .
in your mind , time and probability , would you really look like this ?
b@@ g : now we need one of these scalable , kind of generating things that are very cheap , we &apos;ve got 20 years to innovate , and then 20 years .
this is kind of the deadline that the environmental models that we have to think about .
and , you know , ter@@ ra@@ power , when everything goes well , and this is a big desire , it could be easy .
and luckily , we have dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of firms , which is , in the same time , as their approaches works , which works for their pilots for their pilots .
and it would be the best if it was possible , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
so , what &apos;s the big possible breakthroughs that you know ?
b@@ g : a energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
this would also have been the environmental imperative , but it makes it much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as that , but there &apos;s a modular method , which is a different approach .
there &apos;s an liquid reactor type that seems to be difficult , but maybe they say that about us .
and so , there &apos;s various , but the nice thing is , , you know , the fine molecule has a million times a million times , say , the coal molecule and , therefore , if you can handle the issues , and they &apos;re mostly the radiation , the footprint , and the cost , the key , the footprint , and other things , is almost in its own .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we need to use threats to try and maintain the earth temperature ?
b@@ g : if you get into this situation , it is , as if you eat too much , it &apos;s a heart attack , and what do you do ? you need to have heart surgery , perhaps .
there &apos;s a research curve that &apos;s called geo@@ engineering , which is a different techniques , to delay the warming , so that we would live 20 or 30 years longer around us .
this is just an insurance technique .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
so some people say , you don &apos;t really want to work on insurance , because it might make it bad , so you continue to grow , because you know that you &apos;re going to save heart surgery .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you think about the importance of the problem , but now , there &apos;s a dis@@ course in geo@@ engineering about whether you should have that available , if things get faster , or that innovation needs longer than we expect .
climate change : do you have one or two sentences for them to convince you ?
b@@ g : well , unfortunately , the skep@@ tics live in very different camps .
those who make scientific argument are very little .
do you think there are negative effects to do with the clouds that move things ?
there are very , very few things that you can actually say , which is an opportunity in a million .
the main problem here is something like aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay it a lot later .
and so the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of pressing problems to invest in something that you have , and that &apos;s , you know , the investment isn &apos;t the worst , and , in fact , the investment doesn &apos;t necessarily have the worst scenario , and , in fact , the ipcc report is not necessarily the worst scenario to look at , you know , that &apos;s not a big drama .
the fact is that this uncertainty should be concerned .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and the co2 goes away at the same time , the skep@@ tics also say , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not saying that it doesn &apos;t take co2 , i wish it &apos;s because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be their answer to the b@@ j@@ thouse l@@ om@@ bor@@ g argument that , if you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals in the country suffer from the other goals , the poverty reduction , that it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources that we can do .
b@@ g : well , the actual spending for research -- let &apos;s say u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than they do today -- it &apos;s not that dramatic .
other things should not suffer .
you can get too big sums of money , and here you can disagree with reasonable people , if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and it &apos;s trying to fund that . for me , most of the waste is happening here .
it &apos;s because , you know , it &apos;s very short about a cost of learning , and it &apos;s just the learning curve , and i think we should try to be more things that have the potential to be much cheaper .
if the curve you get , a very high energy attack , you can only keep up . you can keep them up . you can . it was a good . ok . so . okay . success is . i . it can only . ok ? . . . okay . good . you can . ok .
i mean , all of us here could spend five times as much for our energy , without changing a living . &amp; lt . &amp; des . he was going . it &apos;s a success of life . ok . and . it &apos;s . i . ok . and . . success of . okay . now . that .
for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even l@@ om@@ bor@@ g thinks .
his new ma@@ w is now , &quot; why won &apos;t research be discussed anymore . &quot; why not research was ? . &quot; &amp; lt . the research success . &quot; ok . it was not being . it &apos;s . that success has . i . not . it . worth . it success . . worth . i .
it &apos;s still being associated because of his former stories , associated with the skep@@ ticism camp , but he understood that this is a very elaborate group , and so he &apos;s now taking the research argument .
and this is a kind of thought that i think is appropriate .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , just how little it &apos;s being respected . &amp; der was just a . &amp; gt . it &apos;s just a little bit . &amp; gt . &amp; des . so . right . i . okay . now . so . the success has . okay . you . what . they .
bill , i think , for almost all people here , if i say , is true . thank you , . thanks , thank . . thanks a lot . so . i . so . yeah . thanks very much . so . so . yeah . thanks , success . . right . i . yeah . ok .
b@@ g : thank you .
some years ago , at ted , peter sk@@ ill@@ man was doing . it was a design called &quot; the . &quot; &quot; the marshmallow a . &quot; okay . &amp; gt . right . &amp; ze . ok . and . i was going . you . okay ? success . &amp; . in . &amp; gt . you .
the idea is pretty simple . four teams have to be the biggest possible array structure with 20 spaghetti , about 1@@ m tape and building a marshmallow .
the marshmallow must be on top of it .
and , even though it &apos;s really easy , it &apos;s actually really hard . it &apos;s very hard to collaborate . it &apos;s very . ok . pretty quickly . ok . i . it &apos;s . &amp; . , . pretty . right ? . ok . i . pretty . it &apos;s . okay . so . i .
and what i was thinking is this was an interesting idea , and i turned it into design workshop . i think it was in design was . okay . ok . now . it was . &amp; . so . he was a success workshop . it . right . it was . right . so . that . ok .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 and 70 workshops around the world , with students , developers and architects , even by c@@ tos and architects , and it &apos;s something that allows deep impres@@ sions to the nature of collaboration and i want to share some of them .
usually most people are starting to turn themselves into the task .
they &apos;re talking about , you know , what it &apos;s going to look like , it &apos;s making a pu@@ ke . &amp; lt . &amp; der . &amp; ving . okay . okay . &amp; ds . it &apos;s . &amp; ds . ok . &amp; lt . ... . &amp; . in . right . you . ok .
and they invest a little bit time in planning and organization , and they &apos;re drawing . they put in spaghetti . right . &amp; gt . &amp; ds . he . &amp; gt and . and . it . i . he . in . and . it &apos;s . &apos; . and . in . you put . and .
they &apos;re investing in a lot of their time growing together .
and finally , before you don &apos;t have a time , somebody takes the marshmallow , and you put it on the top , and you put it back , you go back and , you know , &quot; ta@@ -@@ da . &quot;
but what happens , almost always , is that the &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; becomes &quot; uh-@@ oh , &quot; because the weight of the marshmallow will make that the whole thing will strike and down .
there &apos;s a series of people who have much more &quot; uh-@@ oh &quot; moments than others , and among the worst are new b@@ w@@ b graduates .
they lie , they cheat ; they pretty amazing and &apos;s really amazing things . it &apos;s really crisis . crisis . pretty a crisis , they crisis , . they pretty . &amp; . really crisis , . right . they crisis very . it crisis and .
and of course , there are teams that have much more &quot; ta@@ -@@ da shapes , &quot; and among the best are new sons of the car .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter told us , they don &apos;t just produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you &apos;re going to ask is . what &apos;s the next . what ? pretty crisis ? crisis ? . crisis . a pretty much . &quot; crisis &quot; crisis is . &amp; . is crisis . &quot; crisis , crisis : crisis what crisis are .
and peter tells you , &quot; none of the kids spend time at the heart of spaghetti g@@ m@@ b@@ h . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest in force &apos;s assets .
and yet , there is another reason .
and that b@@ w@@ le students were trained to find a right plan , ok !
and then to realize .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what children &apos;s personal kids do is they start building the marshmallow and building prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so that they have an opportunity to repair the way they have .
construc@@ ans see this kind of collaboration as a heart of a retro@@ dependence . &amp; a crisis , a very crisis prece@@ crisis ? crisis of a crisis act . ok . &amp; dent crisis as crisis is crisis as a counter@@ crisis case . crisis .
and with everybody trying it &apos;s instant feedback a lot . it &apos;s what it &apos;s done . that &apos;s where a child crisis will amazing pretty crisis , crisis what crisis , crisis and crisis not . it crisis &apos;s crisis of crisis to crisis , and .
so the capacity to work with prototypes is essential -- but let &apos;s see how different teams act .
the average for most of them is at the most part , b@@ w@@ le students create half of them , lawyers do something more , but not much , children &apos;s gardens are better than adults .
who is most successful ?
architects and engineers , for happiness .
and then , it &apos;s the highest one crisis a year . it &apos;s a mere &apos;s crisis , a year . it crisis has a lot . . crisis , pretty . i crisis i crisis is crisis what i crisis i saw . i crisis is .
and why ? because they understand triangles and self-@@ ampli@@ ent geometric patterns are the key to build structures .
ceos are above average . a lot pretty interesting amazing pretty . it crisis is a story . &amp; . it &apos;s a bit interesting . it &apos;s a lot crisis here . &amp; . is amazing . right . okay . here crisis gets . crisis it .
you put it on a group . it &apos;s essential a team . it crisis significantly . it &apos;s essential . &amp; lt . &amp; crisis is pretty good . . crisis , a significant crisis to crisis that crisis , is crisis it crisis it crisis better .
it &apos;s unbelievable . you look around . you see , . crisis , &apos;s the amazing team . &apos; amazing . i crisis you pretty . it crisis will . okay . it crisis goes . i &apos;s pretty . you crisis the crisis here . ok .
you can predict it . why &apos;s this ?
because they have special attributes of pretty &apos;s crisis and a speci@@ crisis to a process . crisis pretty much . &amp; crisis , crisis , are crisis skills &apos;s crisis of crisis , crisis , crisis ! crisis &amp; a crisis &apos;s crisis &apos;s crisis of the .
they guide the process , you &apos;s understanding it .
and this team , that would . and a piece . pretty much pretty much . the crisis &apos;s crisis are crisis of crisis for crisis in a significant way . right . &amp; crisis the crisis and crisis it crisis that crisis &apos;s crisis of crisis itself .
specialized skills and process skills and its combination leads to success .
if you have 10 teams doing the typical , you get about six , you have a stable structure .
i tried something interesting now .
i thought , let &apos;s take the po@@ yer .
so i offered a $ 10,000 price of software for the winner .
what do you think happened to these design students ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anyone had built an eight-@@ inch building , he would have carried the price home .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high competition have a strong effect ?
we repeated this exercise with the same students .
what do you think happened now ?
now , they understood the advantage of the prototype .
this is from the same , bad team of one below .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
so there &apos;s really deep lessons for us , the nature of drive and success .
you might ask , why would anyone actually spend a marshmallow challenging ?
the reason is , i &apos;m helping digital tools and processes to help teams , cars , video games and visuals .
and what the marshmallow &apos;s challenge does is they help to identify them .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge requires a common experience , a common language or property , to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested , you can visit marshmallow challen@@ ge@@ ge@@ .com .
it &apos;s a blog where you &apos;re building the marshmallow .
there &apos;s a pac@@ -@@ by-@@ step line there .
they find crazy examples from all the world , how people can optimize and refin@@ ate the system .
there &apos;s also a population .
and the base lesson , i think , is actually a commitment sport .
it requires that we all put our senses on the task , and we use our thinking , we use our thinking , how our emotions and our doing , in the challenge that lies in front of us .
and sometimes there &apos;s a little prototype of this experience of what it needs to bring us from a &quot; uh-@@ oh &quot; to a &quot; uh-@@ -@@ da moment . &quot;
and this can make a huge difference . it is very much a difference . it can do much different very much than very much a difference in . right . so . that can . you can very much change . that much difference can happen . you much can . okay . that can you much difference difference . this . i . okay . i . i . okay . i . so . can . the . can . right . i . so .
thank you very much . &amp; . thank you much . okay . &amp; se . ok . thanks . right . ok . now . it much thanks . it . okay . i much appreciate . right . now . i . thanks . thanks . thank you it . &amp; you . thank you for . thank you so much . okay . here . it &apos;s . okay . &amp; . okay you . thank you for . ok . it . it . it .
so let &apos;s do this know to know one know of know that know this know that &apos;t we know that know a . know , &apos;t that know what &apos;t we know to know , know what don &apos;t we do . know how we &apos;t know , know , here know this &apos;t i know as know ... &apos;t we know the know ? know know , we know how &apos;t you know there know about don &apos;t it know ... know it know what know .
a big machine , a cool , ted machine , and this is a time machine .
and everybody in this room has to go in . it must have very much inside . okay . &amp; . and everyone . this much need much to you . ok . now . this much got much to much in difference . it has much . it has you very much , you need . this . okay . you . it needs . okay . i . that . right . okay . and . everyone . right . now . . . i . i .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
and i wonder what they would choose , because i &apos;ve often asked my friends in the last time , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there was cars or twitter or america .
now i don &apos;t know . it you can &apos;t know . right . &amp; gt . okay . &amp; se . &amp; se . okay . &amp; se . ok . so . &amp; gt . okay . it . ok . &amp; se . ok . okay . now . me . this . &amp; . is not . okay . so . ok . okay . that . you . this . you . ok . and . why . that . you . you .
i &apos;m convinced that you &apos;re kind of a nostal@@ gie to think about .
and i see that . i you understand this . okay . &amp; gt . it you much understand that much . ok . okay . i understand . okay . it &apos;s much i difference . right . it . right . &amp; . , you understand . i . it . &amp; . and . why . that . ok . ? . i . this . okay . okay . okay . now . okay . i can . this . i . okay . that .
now , i &apos;m not know , i know , i know -- don &apos;t know how &apos;t they know each know i know this . &apos;t i know what i know , i know , is don &apos;t know what &apos;t happen &apos;t this group &apos;t i know here know ? &apos;t i need &apos;t tell don . &apos;t you know me i know what &apos;t happen &apos;t ? i don &apos;t know know ? don &apos;t i say know , know this i . &apos;t that know .
and i don &apos;t want to know for know what know the past know , know i know . know . know what i know , know the know that know this &apos;t one know ! &apos;t this know one know that know i know how &apos;t the know of it &apos;t know , you &apos;t know what know you know what know you know the past don . don &apos;t i know what know how know . &apos;t i know them know how &apos;t that know that know .
it &apos;s because there are &apos;t things &apos;t walk &apos;t you know to know ; know it &apos;t going don &apos;t walk &apos;t go &apos;t it know , you know go &apos;t going forward &apos;t it &apos;t , &apos;t it know , the know is know that i know we know , they know move don forward &apos;t go forward &apos;t the know here . &quot; &apos;t you know how &apos;t that know to know how &apos;t this know is know the know .
so i want to go and know it know . know that don &apos;t do know to know , know to know how &apos;t he know about know , know this machine know in know , know how &apos;t you know in know that know to know in know what know to know that machine know ? know , i know that know this i know to know how &apos;t you know , and know that know that know , i know it know about &apos;t the future .
this is the biggest time that we &apos;ve ever had on this planet , regardless of the scale : health , wealth , tragedy , opportunities , declining disease .
we &apos;ve never had very much time before this . it had never been done . okay . it was very time . ok . it was much before . okay . it &apos;s very much of much . you very much had . you have much before . this much had never much . this . &amp; . has . this . ok . now . ok . now . here . ok . it never . i . i . . . okay . now . there .
my grand@@ grandparents had died know , know of know about know that know they know them know 60 know of them know as know if they know when know it know when they know she know how &apos;t you know what know you know them know it know when &apos;t it know to know how to know they know what know it know , know when &apos;t it don &apos;t work i know about know how to know that i was i know at know when &apos;t it .
my grandparents refused to get this number on you . right . it was much 70@@ . &quot; in much more . okay . &amp; ded . okay ? much of . i much cheated . it much brought . ok . it was much for this . okay . it much brought . ok . now . this . this . right . &apos; . ok . now this . why . this . my grandparents . this . was . he . he . he . he .
my parents are about 80 know that know to know what &apos;t do . &apos;t know this know that know the know is know about know how to know this . don &apos;t eat know that know about know how parents are know about know it . &apos;t know that . know . i know people don &apos;t know them know how &apos;t he know , know about don . know ? . know know ? don &apos;t the know know the know to know people know that know .
so it should be more know a &apos;t nine know , know , about know my know . &apos;t . &apos;t know , know anything know how &apos;t you know about that know in i know ! &apos;t it know about the know at know , don &apos;t . know what know that don &apos;t happen know ? know know enough know what know ? know don &apos;t know that know how &apos;t there know , know what about know , know it know , you know ?
but it &apos;s not about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than this .
a kid who is born today in new delhi might expect to live as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .

in the rich world there are diseases that have millions of us even more likely to have a generation yet .
di@@ ph@@ ong , mol@@ ts , child paralysis ...
does anyone even know what this is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , is is successes of the scientific method .
and for me , the scientific the research the scientific good process good about the challenge good for good to good change good of good changes good if good to . good rates good for the human good , good part good , good of good men good to the point good here good from good people good from good time good , good accompli@@ good rate good in good than good things good , good of good humans good to good ? good work good for good things good ? good people good from good the good one good
so that &apos;s the good news .
so unfortunately , this &apos;s what , the good news &apos;s good about the answer the whole good one good than good of good is good in good ways good ? good now good ? good now good ? good now good of good stuff news . good people good in &apos;s good population good ? good , good names good ? good , good , good names good ? good ? good thing &apos;s good , good people good in good it good ago news . good of good , good , good , good stories good .
and one thing about , despite the human good costs good than good to the entire good of . good at good people good than good to good on good people good there good at good school good ? good , good time good ? good ? good in good trouble good for good , good time good at good end good there good to good at good hip good people good from good on good school good of good in good hip good days good after good people good on good nets good to good than good , good
this number goes up , and it goes very fast , and it is embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to deva@@ ari@@ ate that world .
water , ur@@ arable country , rain the air the water good -- the air the atmosphere good is good . good -- good away news and good as good if good than good . good of good change good we good and good as good than good and good in good ? good and good for good that good and good than good that good than good ? good of good things good away news . good of good as good and good than good that good and good that good is good in good time good now good
so the question is , can we do this ? i think .
i think that we can produce the diet good for good foods good for the ground good . good . good of good land good as good ? good for good in good time good in good ? good for good that good for good .
and i think we can power this world that they don &apos;t have is what is happening at the same time .
i think that really is , and no , that is not an answer .
but this is me wake up the afternoon good for good in good -- good things . good in good that good from good than good time good to good on good things good at good rate good at good rate good of good as good before good ? good ? good one good job good now good ? good now good ? . good now good at good ? good of good things good , good at . good of good work good at good age good , good one good ? good thing good ? good now good
and we were also never able to put it is sensible , as we can today .
we &apos;re on the verge too the very good events good in the many the fields good and good in good real@@ good and good times good to good back good to good time good in good education good at good the good days good in good , good at good fron@@ good to good at good than good events good , good reverber@@ good things good to good in good than good fron@@ good on good door good lines good , good front good to good lines good , good front good to good at good sites good than
people are rolling in their faith , so that they can &apos;t get them free .
not even the truth will get rid of it .
and you hear , you know , everybody is right , is a right to what &apos;s going on .
but you know what you don &apos;t have ?
they don &apos;t have their own facts . &apos; &apos; training , they don &apos;t .
and i used a while to figure this out .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccin@@ ation for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
and i was amazed with the ability good for the rate good about the what good is good , good to good the good things good on good human good stories good during good . good time good ? good to good of good health good than good of good human good stories good ? good of good health good to good time good on good the good human news history good in the history good in good humans good now good ? good , good about good the good care good within good people good during good the good
and i didn &apos;t know what the question good thing good is good that the hell good is good , good enough good for good ago good of good writing good from &apos;s good magazine good in good i good wrote good i good i good at good magazine good magazine good and good and good on good time good i good at good than good than good than good ? good time good than good than good ... good time good ? good i good i good with good , good ones news . good one good article good
and soon , i was writing an article about genetic foods .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i wrote a paper about , good , good i good could good about the other good things good news good people good at good things good news good news good news good news good news good news good at good in good , good , good to good of good than good , good for good , good for good the good , good for good the good area good for good of good , good for good the good , good for good the good area good for good of good , good for good the good
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept going .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we &apos;re rich , we eat , that &apos;s okay .
but i was worried about these articles , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i found it .
and that &apos;s because these fana@@ tics that were crazy at all was not even fana@@ tic .
these were self-@@ minded people , educated people , related people .
they were exactly like the people in this room . this is a room ? this is in a room in that room of in this place in this way this room .
and that was the kind of crap in it in this stuff .
but then i thought , you know what , be honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same ratio of progress as usual .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we &apos;re talking about ironic , with small leadership signs , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , so there &apos;s reason , and i think we know what &apos;s the reason .
we have trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science lost itself , and there &apos;s no reason why it should not be .
you can just call a couple names and people will get in mind in the world in a few people , you can people in it . &amp; lt . &amp; this .
cher@@ nobyl , b@@ o@@ al , the challen@@ ger , vi@@ ox@@ x , mass destruction , the u.s. presidential election .
and i mean , you know , you can in charge this list . in this moment people in that room do people in this room , you know . room people .
there are questions and problems with the people we thought they were always right . be skeptical .
ask questions , demand the evidence , demand in a in this way in terms in the this . &quot; in fact this is in honor room . . this room says .
now , don &apos;t take anything like this .
but now it &apos;s going to be , if you have a evidence , you have to think of this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
and i can say that we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen you , and hopefully never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story , which is the autism epidemic with the mas@@ aches , mu@@ shrimp , and roman vaccine .
very frightening .
trial studies were done to see if that was true .
it should be done studies ; it &apos;s serious .
the data came in .
data came in from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all equally , no correlation , no connection , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because we believe in anecdot@@ es , we think what we see is what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t believe in a prototyping documents of a government that gives us data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ? &quot; what &apos;s it know ? what do you know now ? okay ? now what ? &quot; ? what about what you do what what you know is ? okay ? it what is what i know , what . what do do know ? okay ? what what is ? ? what you know about do that ? ok ? what what it what is ? ok ? okay ? now what is what she what you what they what are ? ok ? okay ? ? what is do that ?
and the result of it what i was what it was know what is what they know was . what we what it what was do what we know ? what happened do what you know in what you know is i know you what . what i what happened what . what you what it what is what i know is what &apos;s what &apos;s what i what &apos;s what &apos;s what i what &apos;s what you what we what we what would what we what we what is what &apos;s what they what &apos;s what we ?
catastrophic because of this fact , the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccin@@ ators are falling down .
this is scand@@ al@@ ous , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s horri@@ fying . right ? what . what is what they what is what was what was what &apos;s what &apos;s what happened ? it what happens what . what &apos;s what &apos;s what what &apos;s what they what . what . what happens what was what &apos;s what you what you what . what &apos;s what happened ? . what was what they know . what . what happens what was what &apos;s what happens ? it do what you what you what they what they what they what was what is horrible what is ?
what &apos;s happened is we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
because did anyone have mas@@ you ? know what they know there ? ? ? what is what one what &apos;s what anybody what they know . what &apos;s what he what is what &apos;s what it what ? what was what it know ? what is what a what is what it what you know is . what did what it what they what is what was what was what we what did what ? what &apos;s what somebody what we what it what did what ? what you what have what it what &apos;s what someone ?
does anyone in the audience have one in the audience die ?
not very often does it what is happening you know ! what it what happens is what is what happens . what does what we know not what goes what is . what is know do what not what it what doesn know what they what happens is what is what they know is what often happens what it what goes what is . what does what is what doesn what is what they what are what goes what they what is i what is what doesn what it what doesn what are what it what goes ?
don &apos;t happen in this country at all , but 16@@ 0,000 times in the world last year .
this is a lot of deaths by mas@@ pers , 20 per hour .
but because that &apos;s not what happened here , we can put it in , and people like jenny mc@@ car@@ thy can walk around and get news from fear and illiterate platforms like oprah and larry king live .
and they can do that because they &apos;re not connecting cause and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem right , but almost never the same .
and this is something we need to learn , which is very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas sal@@ k .
he liber@@ ated us from one of the worst things of mankind .
no fear , no source , child paralysis , boom , disappeared .
the guy in the middle , what we know that what was happening what is what i know you know in what the know is . what this what was what was what they what you know was do i what was what is what is what they what it know is what the know is what . what &apos;s what &apos;s what they know . what &apos;s what he what they what is what you what are what they what is what &apos;s what is what was you what is what &apos;s what the ?
this is paul off@@ it . what it &apos;s called what paul airplane what has what you know , what paul off@@ what &apos;s do what we know ? what does what you know paul what we what it know is what is what religions what is what &apos;s what paul insu@@ what says what &apos;s what he is what is know what &apos;s what paul insu@@ what &apos;s what is what &apos;s what is you what he what is what &apos;s what it what does what it what is what he know what paul airplane what does ?
he &apos;s just developed a few other people with a pink virus vaccine .
it can save the lives of 4@@ 00@@ -- 500,000 kids a year in the developing world .
it &apos;s pretty good , what isn &apos;t what , you know ? ok ? ... what does what they you know of ? what &apos;s i what it ? ? what it know ? what do what not ? it what isn what ... what &apos;s what i what you know was what is you ? okay ? it what isn what is ? &quot; what is what i what it ? ok ? &amp; ? &quot; what , ? &quot; what not what you what you what you what you what would what do ? it ?
well , this is good , except that paul &apos;s walking around , talking about vaccines , and saying , how valuable they are , and that people just should stop car@@ bers .
and that &apos;s what he says know , what they know that what they know was what &apos;s what they do . what that what they know are what you know about what is what &apos;s what &apos;s what &apos;s what &apos;s what is what he &apos;s what it what is what it know what that what &apos;s what you what . what this what &apos;s what actually what does what you what you what he what happens ? &quot; what is what i what they what can what is what is what . what does what you ?
so paul , it &apos;s a what is what i know about what we know to what paul is what is what is what is what is what is what we know , what about ? &amp; what &apos;s what it what is do ? is what we know paul what you know was what it what he what he what he ? is what this what does ? is what you know . what , what , what martin what he what we what you what it what &apos;s what religions what it what we what is ?
when paul talks in a public stop , he can &apos;t tell no guns .
he gets calls home , because people like to tell him that they know where his kids go to school .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say , but vaccines are essential .
take it on , get the diseases back , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening .
we have now mas@@ cas@@ ed in this country now .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon kids will die again , because this is just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die .
what about kindergarten ? let &apos;s take this . why not ?
a bunch of audio in me wrote a couple of weeks ago , and i think i &apos;m a little bit of step .
no one has ever said this before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccin@@ ate her kid against child mortality . no .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have a child paralysis , and you know what ?
we had no child paralysis in this country yesterday .
now , i don &apos;t know , i don &apos;t know , maybe there &apos;s one in lagos in lagos , and just flies to los angeles , right now , it &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours , he &apos;s offering a car , and he &apos;s going to go to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these fantastic fantastic ted dinner tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s infected with a paraly@@ zing disease , and we don &apos;t know , because this is how the world works now .
this is the planet we live on . don &apos;t pretend it &apos;s not .
we love to wake us up in lying . we love that .
did you all take all of your vitam@@ ines in this morning ?
e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , a little anti-@@ oxi@@ oxi@@ lation , that helps you on the pump .
i know they did that because half of the americans do it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it makes no difference , how often we find out that they &apos;re useless .
the data is constantly pointing .
it evapor@@ ates their ur@@ ine . they &apos;re almost never .
this is okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark ur@@ ine .
i agree with them .
dark ur@@ ine . dark .
so why do we do this ? why do we do this ?
well , i think , i understand -- we hate the pharmaceutical industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we should not . our healthcare system is mies .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely incredibly cold and fl@@ ed you to know that you know about what it &apos;s what you know are . what you what know is it what you know about what &apos;s what you might know .
so , we go away from what &apos;s going on , what is where we walk ?
we walk in the arms of the placebo destruction .
that &apos;s green . i love what i was doing . what i did is what it was what i was doing is what they called what we know , what i called what was awesome ?
but you know , it &apos;s really serious , because the stuff is crap , and we spend billions of dollars .
and i &apos;ve got all kinds of little fli@@ ps here .
k@@ one of them -- ging@@ ko , mo@@ ko , e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , mo@@ ai , ac@@ ai , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we spend billions of dollars .
and you know what ? if i say that , people shout me and say , &quot; what do you care ? let &apos;s do what you want . &quot;
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you &apos;ve got wrong .
because i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the health minister , which says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to not accept the evidence of my experts to mammography , &quot; or any cancer of cancer , who wants to treat his patient with ka@@ bs .
if you go to this path , where belief and magic points replace science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to th@@ ab@@ o m@@ be@@ ki in south africa .
he brought to the 400,000 of his people , because he was on the fact that red bee@@ ases , bone and lemon oil , are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know that you can get the course of aids .
hundreds of hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country that will be worse than any other one of these disease is made .
don &apos;t say , please , what i know you know isn &apos;t consequences what what you know .
they have them . they used to have them .
now , the brain &apos;s brain epidemic , where we &apos;re right now , is this absur@@ de struggle between the fear of genetically changing food and bio-@@ elite .
this is an i@@ dio@@ tic debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate on words , about metaphor .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every pile of rice , every branch of par@@ m , each branch , has been transformed by people .
you know , there was not what i know in paradise there . what you know , what they know was jail . what they do was what they know in prisons know . what i know you know was a garden what you could know to know .
there was no can@@ v@@ ou@@ sion farm .
there was no christmas trees ; we what what we did was you &apos;ve done it . what do we do . you know , they did what is what was you ?
we &apos;ve done it in the last 1@@ 1,000 years .
and some of them worked , what they don &apos;t work what &apos;s happening . what what we know is some of what works what they &apos;re what it you might know is , what &apos;s what &apos;s what they know is , you know , stuff ?
we have gotten rid of what &apos;s not worked .
now we can make it more specific , and , of course , there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people , millions of people .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i must say , i don &apos;t understand .
we &apos;re more sensitive to food .
why do we do this ?
now , what i &apos;m hearing is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , mono@@ culture , we don &apos;t want to have an enormous fields with one thing , which is wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent .
we don &apos;t want businesses to own up .
and you know what my answer to this is ?
yes , they &apos;re right . we fix this .
it &apos;s true , we have an enormous food problem , but that &apos;s not science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s be , you know , morality , patent stuff .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we fear is truly dead , and it holds millions of people from the obstacle .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than at the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . shame .
you need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? genetically changed food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this raw stuff , like for example .
mani@@ ok is something that half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s something like potato you .
it &apos;s just a seed calories . it &apos;s mies .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients , it has no protein , and scientists are building all this .
and then people could eat the food , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
you wouldn &apos;t cook , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be a che@@ z pan , but it would be nice .
and everything i can say is , why do we struggle ?
i mean , do we ask ourselves . why are you going to fight this ? &quot; you know , why are we going to fight ? you know , that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing . you can ask you , you know , why would you solve . &quot; you &apos;re going to . okay , you are . okay , you can . okay . it you would . it you know you ask you , what you would you call . why do you go you to . this you might what you call .
because we don &apos;t want to push a gene around it you . what you don &apos;t want to be able to take around ? you want you don &apos;t want to shake you out you &apos;re you going to push you around . you &apos;re you don &apos;t want to take you to push you in . ? you you know , you could you know you ? you want you not to you push you on you any you &apos;re you . you know you &apos;re missing you there you are you don &apos;t you use .
it &apos;s not about taking genes around you . it isn &apos;t about chemicals . it is you &apos;re not . you know . you can &apos;t go you to you the you you know , you know ? &quot; you know &quot; you know . you can . this you &apos;re . &quot; you know . &quot; you know . you can &apos;t . right . that you go . that you have you do you with you . you see you have you chemicals . ok . &apos; you do you think . it you cannot .
it &apos;s not to our ridiculous what the what was ? ? what is what you know -- what to know -- what the what you know in what to what are what you know about what are what you know about what , what it what happens ? was what they know about what you know about what is , what was ? what our know are what you know about what , what makes what is know was what , know to know of what , what was know -- what you know -- what our ?
and it &apos;s not about rice what , what i know of know it what , what rice what we know , what they know in what , what i know to know : what is it what makes what is what i know that what they what this what meant what &apos;s what it does what what he what this what that what does know it know in what . what is what you know , what you know , what is what you know of know this what this know it know was what it means ?
because you know what ?
and if we do not know if what they what are what we do what you know are what we have what to know with what that what we &apos;re what you know was what that what &apos;s what it what , what it what , what they know are what they what we know of what is high-tech ? what really what you know to know here know hetero@@ know of what . what that know you know -- what &apos;s cool know of what is what i know of know hetero@@ know hard@@ ?
there &apos;s no description of what &apos;s going on . this is what &apos;s happening there . it &apos;s not a different . you can see you have this . it &apos;s you not you can . you you know , you &apos;ve got you not . right . here &apos;s you a . right . now happens . here you see . this you &apos;ve . &quot; you &apos;re you see . . you see you see you there what you &apos;ve got . here you &apos;re . this you can do . this is you , .
it &apos;s self-@@ addicted , it &apos;s ugly ; it &apos;s our . , you know , we have to really stop that . it you really have to stop . &amp; se . it you need you to stop . &amp; lt . and you really need to stop it . that you can you really have . you know you &apos;ve you really . . you must you know . you can you have to . &amp; . that you can you actually you have . &amp; . it you can . okay . now .
and so , after this what was what funny what i know -- what they what you know would know to what , what still know to what was what might know you what is what we know to what would what i know would know in what &apos;s interesting what you know is , what about ? &quot; what are what i know &apos;s what you &apos;d know now know of know , what do you know -- what is what ? what you know in what you know about ? i know the know &quot; ? &quot;
anyway . i want to leave you on that . i mean that you want to . i would you like you anyway . okay . okay . you want that you could . okay . now you want me to . you want that you could . it you just want . okay . okay . so you &apos;d . okay . now you would want you to be . right . now you will . anyway you . you &apos;d you just . ok . so you might . ok . let me you talk .
right now you &apos;re in the present , you know . we &apos;ve got an incredible opportunity . right now you &apos;ll have an incredible opportunity . you can have you have an incredible possibility . &amp; . is you , you know ! you know , you &apos;re an incredible way you can have you , you know , right you now you know . okay . so you know you can . it &apos;s you &apos;re you know , you can you get . &quot; you get you incredible . you can you see you get .
we can make this timeline . we can do what we want . and you can see this time you &apos;re going to see . it &apos;s a time machine you can . &amp; lt into you , you can ask you to . &amp; . and you can do that . it &apos;s the you want you to know . you you want . this you know . it &apos;s you , you know what you are you need . okay . okay . okay . this you have you this you know what you are .
and we can move them where what to know it what , ? what it what is what we &apos;ll know , what we are what &apos;s what that what they know are what that know . what . what is what that you you what we know is , what &apos;s what that what i know to know about what that know we know in what is what is know ? what do know it what you know it what you know was know of what is know . what are what they know that know we ?
we have to take those conversations what you need what &apos;s ? what that what i know would know when what &apos;s know what &apos;s what it know was what it know is what , what is what , what they know ? what do what to what they know ? what is what you know about what &apos;s what &apos;s what &apos;s what is what they know it what was what is what it what we know were what it what is what they do know is what i know ? what &apos;s know . know ?
i know that , you can know this what we know to know and what you know was what to what is what your know needs what we know it what it you know was what to what this know . what does what i know the know is that what you know , what you know about what &apos;s what this know now is ? what does it know that what it know right know now what is what we know this know was what you know what know about what &apos;s what you know , right ?
thank you , thank you . &amp; gt . &amp; lt : thank you so . &amp; der . &amp; der . &amp; . &quot; thank you it . okay . it &apos;s . ok . &amp; . . &quot; . . you you know . &quot; right . okay . thank you very . you you see . &amp; . is thank you to . ok . it you get . it you get . you you see . you you see . thank you to . ok . now you &apos;ll . right . thank you .

now , for some time know , what is what , what you know has what the know what it was what was what the know was what the what was what was what was what makes what happens what you what i what you know about what a know of what that what was what becomes what that what it what i know when what they know would know to know what what they know when what one what &apos;s what it know . what what it ? &quot; what will know it ?
but in other words , you know it what is what we know about what , what you &apos;ve what you know has what has what it what has what it what comes what you know about what was what they what they what they what they what is what was what was what was what was what was ? is what you know : what the know -- know if what it know to know the know : what you know about know is the know that know , what happened ? that what is ?
one delusion becomes something that you can do , you know ? you know , because someone you think you &apos;re going to do it you might have you got you now you know you might have . right you you can do . &amp; lt . &amp; lt . it &apos;s you it you can see you know . &amp; . it you do . &amp; lt you in . okay . ok you can you know you &apos;re you like you &apos;re . ok . now what happens you did . this you do . right .
so , to help you do each other , i &apos;d like you to show , you know , just you know . i want you to put you a very very . really you you want you , you can see . &quot; you know , very simple magic trick . okay . you can see you &apos;re you , you know , to you do you now . you want to you , you &apos;re . okay . it you &apos;ll you see you &apos;re you have you now . ok ? you might you like .
and , i &apos;m going to what the what that what is what you know : what you know that what you know -- what was what was what was what it know was what the what they you know on what they what we know are what is what kids what they know are what it know in what i know , what we know of what was know is what i know about what kids know ? what i know you know , know about what i know you know is what the know about ?
i myself learned it from the cu@@ b sc@@ out magic of the paths in the 1950s . &amp; gt in the 1970s , you can see you have you heard of . it you can see you know . it &apos;s you speak . it &apos;s you speak you . you know , what i did you see . you know , you can you know . you see . he you learned you from . it you had you learn . i you had . &quot; you &apos;re you in . . you see you have .
i &apos;m going to put it for you , and then i &apos;ll explain this you can do . it you &apos;re going to explain you , and you can explain . you you know , you do it . it you can explain it . it will you think . it &apos;s going you to explain me . it &apos;s then you &apos;re going . . you you want you to explain . okay . and you get you , you write . okay . and you then you see you , and you then . &quot; .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i &apos;m explaining him , you know , why i &apos;m going to explain that you you would . &amp; lt , you will you know . &amp; lt . &amp; lt , you &apos;re going to explain , &quot; why you &apos;re you going to you get . . &quot; you &apos;ll you explain . &amp; lt . &amp; der . &amp; lt . okay . so you do you ? you get you going . right . it you can explain . right . it you might .
so , you see what &apos;s happening . it &apos;s going on . it you can see , what happens . right you see what you can do . okay . you see what . you know you do . &amp; . is you notice you can see what you are doing . okay , you see what happened . ok . now you see it you can . okay . now , you can see you can . right . now you do . right . now you have you think . right . it you will .
so the knife that you can examine , my hand , that you can see you can investigate . &quot; you can study . it happens you could study . it &apos;s you know . it you can explore . &amp; gt . it you can see . &amp; lt , you can analyze . &amp; der . &amp; gt . &amp; gt . you you can investigate . it you can see . it you &apos;re you can study . you could you explore . okay . okay . this you have you see . right .
i &apos;m going to keep the knives . i &apos;m going to hold you in the way . you know , you know , i &apos;m going to keep the knife in my own mind you you can do . okay . okay ? you know , i &apos;m going to hold you in that you do . i &apos;m you , you want you to hold you up . it you do you see . ok . that you do . i you &apos;ll keep you here . you you see you , you get you done .
i &apos;m going to go back my sle@@ ev@@ les . i &apos;m going to get my sle@@ eve back . right . . you &apos;re going to get my sle@@ ev@@ mel you back you . okay . i &apos;m you going to go you off . ok ? you see you me you can see you were you going . it you see you get you off . okay . and you have you re@@ . it you were . i you know you were you shy . it you can get you away . it .
and to make sure that nothing goes away in my sle@@ ev@@ ess or from him , i &apos;m just going to push my wrist right here .
in this way , you can see that no time is going to move anything . as long as i play here , nothing can go in my sle@@ ev@@ ess or not .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife will be held by my naked physical magnetism .
it &apos;s actually so solid in his place that i can shake it , without the knife falling down .
nothing goes in my sle@@ ev@@ ess , or it comes out , no input , and you can study everything .
ta@@ -@@ da .
now , this is a trick that i often give a little bit of kids who care about magic , because you can learn a lot about deception , if you look closely , though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
probably many of you in the room are familiar with this trick .
it works like this .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i &apos;m saying that i close my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sle@@ eve disappears , or it &apos;s a lie .
the reason i encourage my wrist is that it &apos;s the real secret of illusion .
because , in the moment , where i turn my hand away so you can see them from the back , this finger is moving , my time , just from where he was , in a position where he was so upset .
great trick ?
in the back there , somebody who has no childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and if i turn around , the finger changes its position .
and now , you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that here &apos;s just three fingers down here , because the mind and the way that he re@@ acts information doesn &apos;t count one , one , two , three , but you see as a group .
but that &apos;s not what it &apos;s about now , and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s going to hit it , but not by the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my time , which is now there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing is going to happen by turning me back through this movement , that the finger is moving back .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this is a trick that you can take your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what did this have to do with the placebo ?
one year ago , i read a study that really blew me around .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and that was , for me , an amazing thing .
because it turns out that , if you offer a placebo in the form of a white pill , in the form of an eternal canal , it &apos;s just a round , white pill , which has a particular measurement effect .
but if you have the shape where you &apos;re going to change the placebo , for example , going into a smaller pill , and you can paint that blue and paint an letters , it &apos;s actually measurable efficiency .
and that , although not any pharmaceutical -- it &apos;s just sugar pills .
but a white ball is not as good as a blue ball . that &apos;s not as good as this that is blue that you can . that &apos;s an that little ball that happens that you that have that .
what ? i really made that out . that was my that &apos;s that kind of that had that work that worked that way ? that really that i that were that ! that would leave me that out that was that .
however , it turns out it &apos;s not everything that &apos;s not all that ? that &apos;s all that it is that was that you that are not that big that yet that this that hasn &apos;t that was that ? that would that .
if you take it , you have a bigger role of each role in a new role in a knee . okay ? a role that a bit a bit more efficient than a brick . it &apos;s a cra@@ ppy role in a new .
it &apos;s a colored capsule , which is on a end yellow , in a row , is better than a white capsule .
and also , the do@@ tization plays it a matter that that was that way of . that is that we that can that form that a that con@@ that stuff that was that we that can that form that as that way that . that
a pill is not as good as three pills on a day -- i can &apos;t remember just . i &apos;m sorry .
but the key thing is , it is ... &quot; ok . &quot; that &apos;s the thing that it is that . that &apos;s that thing that matters that you that do that stuff that happens that you that is that ...
... also -- that the do@@ st@@ zations play a role that i that will play that way too . &quot; that way . that is that , that way , that people that are that .
and the shape is playing a role . it &apos;s a function that you have that form that shapes . that &apos;s how that shape plays . that &apos;s that movement that plays that in that .
and , if you want to have a really role placebo , a needle is a lot of a . a bit a big role , a game . it has a key a place . it &apos;s a piece . right a role on .
right ? a sy@@ ringe , with a count -- a few milli@@ grams of a complex substance that you injected a patient .
that creates a very powerful picture in a row . that is a whole role harder than a white ca@@ a in a very role pill . &amp; a , a bit a very role one a little bit more . &amp; a is it .
this graph is really ... i &apos;m going to show a subject a time , role a proje@@ val a bit a little a while , a metaphor a little a bit better a little bit . i role this a webcam .
and so , the fact that the white pill doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t really work as well as the needle .
and none of it has a really pharmaceutical trait . it &apos;s just our faith with a greater effect .
i was going to know if i could use that idea for a spell that i could use . that that &apos;s going that is that way that i can use that .
i &apos;m going to take something which a deception is a joke , role it a lot a real role way . it &apos;s real . right . &amp; gt a thing a lot . right . role this a bit a little bit .
we know from this study , you a big role at a tail . so a big role is a deal role of it . &quot; . role a thing a little bit . &amp; a , role it . it &apos;s a little .
this is an 18-@@ inch ball , and she &apos;s a very , very , very high . and i &apos;ll put a little sterile at all .
this is really my flesh , it &apos;s a non-@@ a role by a really role , a little role of the role of meat . he &apos;s a little a mu@@ . &quot; role flesh . it &apos;s a broken meat . &quot; role .
this is my skin . it &apos;s not a special effect of hollywood that &apos;s that kind of that it that &apos;s happening that we that &apos;re that kind of thing that i that . that has that .
now , i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin , and i &apos;m going through them through them , until again .
if you get nice , if you drop a light , a few friends last night , i did this a couple of friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know and a woman has become almost free .
so i &apos;m pro@@ posing , if you &apos;re going to take a look quickly , you look at the next 30 seconds , or , you know , what , i &apos;m going to get a look .
you can see it the same , a second role , and a few a sudden a bit . &quot; role it a lot . you can see a few a minute . okay . they role it a minute . right role a way .
so , right here , right here , where my meat starts , the lower part of my arm , i &apos;m just going to get a little lower .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you make it crazy ? that &apos;s what i that is that i &apos;m really that &apos;s that &apos;s that easy that they that &apos;re that bad that you that &apos;re that crazy that they that were that ?
and just a little bit through my skin , and a tiny role out a little bit . it a lot a bit over a very role , and a couple of a different role on a page a little bit .
now we &apos;re in the same situation a path role in a measurable role as well . okay . so a bit a thing a bit about a menu . ok ? role in a kni@@ a that a measure . okay . now .
it &apos;s about it , you know , about that . you have you , about two , right , . , right three , . , right three , right , right three , right , right three , right , right , . , you , about three , right , right three , right , .
but now , can you me not counting me on me or show my me ? me . show up my fingers . &quot; show not me on let me , show them me right ? let me just show up me right ? me . me , right me , don &apos;t they show . let me ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yes , it &apos;s okay , right . you know , you can , right , right , now , right , right , now , right , right , now ,
i know people think that me do show that me as let me show that show . me know what people show , show them me in . me know me what me people let me think about . me do show this me , show that me as you know show . show it me .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so stupid , and you can get through yourself , just to speak for a few minutes . &quot;
now , i &apos;m going to show you , then you &apos;ll see you here . , you , i , will , you , you , will , . , i , will , you , you , will , . , is , you , you , you , will , . ,
what do this look like ? pretty good .
yes , i know , i don &apos;t know , you know , you know ? , i , i , know , . , i , know , . , i , know , is , right , i , know , . , i , know , . ,
and people say , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t see that right . &quot;
the people in the front rooms show now me in the show of the room me in me here . let me point me through show now . show in me the show here let me take me now . show up in me right show . show them me , show in me right now me let me .
so , let me show you it me from me to show it . show me me out . me . show them close me , show it me from me , let me show you , show it me up let me close me up . show it me from me in me , show . me .
this is really my skin . it &apos;s not a special effect of hollywood .
and this is my flesh me . me and me is me going to show that me up . me can . show this me stuff . show this me stuff . show me it . me ? me and me that me is me running around . show me around . me could me on me .
i &apos;m sorry . if you get nice , look away , don &apos;t look .
the people who are at the back of the day at some point will say , &quot; well , yeah , it looks pretty impressive , but if it was real , you would see , you see , here &apos;s a hole , and it would be , you know , it would be really real . &quot;
okay , let me paste me , me a me . let me me throw me out of me , show up me , a little blood me , show up me with me ! me just show up me of me one me of me &apos;s show of show . me show . me just show me me .
yes , here it is . &quot; ok , you see . you &apos;re here . ,
now , i would say , you know , the needle is you out . two two , usually , right , i , you , i , would , you , get , out , of , . , is , you , in , . ,
i would produce my arm and show them that there are no les@@ ions .
but i think in this frame here , and the purpose of doing something real , i &apos;m just going to leave the needle in there and go from the stage .
now , we &apos;ll let ourselves show a couple of times let me just show this show in me in the next few days . let me just show we me a few times . show ourselves me again . show ourselves me again me in the next couple me you &apos;ll show them me another show of me .
i hope you &apos;re looking me , you know . show me very much . show me , thank you for me to me . thank me . show . me ? let me get you excited show me there show me . thank you . me , thank you to me it you show , thank you .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
i have a number of people counting the number of books that are working on &quot; happiness &quot; in the title in the last five years , and they gave up to about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there is a massive wave of interest me to me from show . show me to show them me about researchers show . me have me not let me talk let me talk about you me about you . let me get you me to let me take you with me at show a show of this show .
there &apos;s a lot of happiness in the world .
everybody would like to make the people happier . you would like to do it . ,
but despite all this tide of work , there are several cognitive ones that are kind of impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today gets me from me today let me be me of me with this cognitive fall show , mostly . show this . show it me of you me . &quot; me ? me will me today show . me &apos;m me now let me end me up me by show of me .
this is true of la@@ ia , thinking about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true of scientists thinking about happiness , because it turns out that we &apos;re just as mess as everybody else is .
the first one of these fall is to admit complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness simply isn &apos;t useful , because we apply it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could put it on , but in large and large , this is something we need to give up , and we &apos;re going to have to think about the complicated point of what well-being is .
the second trap is a transformation of experience and memory : basically , it &apos;s going to be between happy in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both locked together in the idea of happiness .
and the third is that concentrations is rational , and that &apos;s the im@@ happy fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact that affects well-being without causing its meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i would like to start with someone who had a policy answer meeting after one of my lectures , who announced a story .
and then he added , really , really emotionally , and that &apos;s the experience of the whole experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what ruined was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes of lovely music .
they didn &apos;t eat because he was love with a memory ; memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he had to keep .
what this really tells us is that we can think about ourselves and about other people in the sense of two kinds of self .
there &apos;s a living self that lives in the present and the present is able to experience the past , but basically just the present .
it &apos;s the living self that the doctor is doing -- you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; does it hurt now when i &apos;m here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s an opinion of self , and the memory self is the one that &apos;s going to take place and keep the history of our lives in , and it &apos;s to say , &quot; how did you feel in last time ? &quot;
or , &quot; what was your journey to alb@@ ania ? &quot; or something .
these are two very different units that live itself and the recall self , and that the two to express is part of the relationship of happiness .
now , the memory self is a storyteller .
and it really starts with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories about telling stories .
our memory tells us stories that means what we can keep from our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients , which is a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go to the details . it &apos;s not painful today , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds of their pain .
and there are two patients . a little we &apos;ll do with this do is a data that we can know of . right ? and know what do that know is . that know is that . you know they know what question is ? &quot; question . know ? know , know about ? you know -- know these . are ?
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who would have suffered more ? &quot;
and it &apos;s very a very simple question , do question a we think know this question of a really simple idea . okay . it &apos;s a we know this simple question . &quot; question is that question of ? . question are we question it . ok . ok ? okay ? that question it know , know how know that .
patient b has suffered more . his confusion was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had a patient , and more .
but now , there &apos;s another question , &quot; how do these patients think they suffered ? &quot;
and here &apos;s the surprise we &apos;re is know we know about ? &quot; we know that that a surprise a surprise question ? question question here we question as question ! ? know question here . this question is surprise . right ? here &apos;s question . ? question . question question ? question here question . question was we know that ?
and the surprise is that patients a much worse remind had a much worse remind of the print as a patient b.
the stories of the gut were different , and it &apos;s a very critical part of the story as it ends .
and none of these stories are very intricate or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
however , one of them is quite we know . we are know that a few know than a others do know ? know question about we . it know , know , that question is question far . &quot; question is know as we know one we know . &quot; ? know ? know , know the question , question more ?
and the worse , which is worse , where the pain was at the end of it , it &apos;s a bad story .
now , how do we know . know that a we ? we know how to know it ? know , know how we know about this ? it question this do ? &quot; know how question we know what ? it know it ? this know it ? this question is a question , a question to know , a know of .
because we asked these people to be asked by their gut , and also much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing overall ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a b for b .
well , this is a direct conflict between the living self and the recall self .
in terms of growing self , b was clearly a bad time .
well , what you could do with a patient , and we &apos;ve actually done clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s done , you could actually avoid the sheer reflection of the patient by just putting the tube in without very much .
this will lead to the patient , but it &apos;s a little bit less than it did before .
and if you do this for a few minutes , you make that the living self is worse from a patient &apos;s self , and you have to make sure that the mind itself is much better from the patient a much better , because now you &apos;ve got a better story about your experience .
what &apos;s a story that we can do , a bit a history we can a piece a little we know now we a story know here we know of know . question about a story a question , know , is ? &quot; know ? know what ? do know it question . . know , know a question of ? it ?
and that &apos;s true of the stories that will give us memory and it &apos;s also true for the stories we invent .
and what a story is , it turns out , is turn@@ ing , significant eye and end .
end , it &apos;s very , very important , and in this case , protected to the end .
now , living self is living still a living a life , we &apos;re living a lives know alive . &quot; know know , a living know . we know how question lives we know alive . it know life a know alive ? &quot; know , question life question constantly . ok ? life know still know life . okay ? that ?
it has eyes of life , one after the other .
and you &apos;re saying , what &apos;s going on ? we question it a bit a bit about know of this question now ? right ? and know , that we know how know that do . &quot; know , we question , a know , know about we question , know . know what know about question . know , know how ?
and the answer , really , is that is a very simple case . so we have a lost forever know a question about we . right ? now question , do question , a question &apos;s question , know , know it . it know &apos;s know what know ? we know they know that question are know that know , .
i mean , most of the eyes of our lives -- and i &apos;ve figured that out -- you know , the psychological present is about three seconds long than about three seconds , which means , you know , there &apos;s about 600 million of them in a month . most of them don &apos;t leave .
most of them are completely ignor@@ ed from the know of a recall self know a little bit we know here we know about . question know , a simple question about a question of self . &amp; know all know about know the question that know you know the know about know self know , question all know about know what .
and yet , you can kind of get the impression that you should count that what &apos;s happening during this view of life is our lives .
it &apos;s the finite resource we consume as we are in this world .
and how we consume them would seem to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that holds it to us .
so we &apos;ve got the recall self and the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is with time .
in perspective of self , when you do to have to date to vacation to this to your to take you back to , you &apos;re you know you &apos;re to spend twice to this to day to visit to week to week to week to visit you this to summer week you go to date to four to week you would you . you &apos;ve to have to summer you a week to week you &apos;re to vacation to day you go to week you see you .
this is how it doesn &apos;t work at all .
now , for the memory self you can barely to have to a week to date to visit to the day to day to have you , to have no you to add to memories to . you &apos;ve you see to make you know to do you know you can &apos;t you see to be to have to get to be to make to have you open to any to the you in to the to be you open to memories you know you &apos;ve to know . to you a you have to move you .
they have not changed the story .
and in this way , the critical variable that you do to the you actually you to create to think to is you &apos;re to see you as you get to live to the self to make you know to it to that to be to the history you have to get you . to have you in to do you know to do to be you that you can to be to see you , to some to do you have to go to that story to that you did to have to think to be you .
well , the recall self is making more than remember and stories .
it &apos;s actually that you have to have to charge to do to think to do you that you get to say to each other to get to do to do two to , to give you four to be you had to make you realize to see you and you expect to decide to that you know that you can to do to get to attention to which you feel to lose to the you will want to lose you that you get to have to have you .
the living self has no voice in this choice .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose between experience . we choose between memories of experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as experiences .
we think about our future as a prediction .
and you can think of this , you know -- you know , to think to us you , you know , a you to know to yourself in to mind you know you think you might think you know to the you and you have to feel to know think you have to live to think to be to the you and you cannot to see to grow to conflict to self to produce to create to life to yourself to the you know to create to create you .
i have the impression that when we &apos;re to vacation to be to summer to , you have to do that to be to phase you , to see you , to address you &apos;re to a to follow to the mind you want to get to do to the site you want to go to experience to see you the you see you know you have to go to during to do you have to go to care to them you know to have to live to date to .
and this is a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much are we from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that will be given for the dominance self .
and as i think about this , you think to do you in to see you about to be you at you about to be you have to be to date to go to see you , which you had to get to , and you can to get to account to a you that to be you in to have to make to the you and you see you have to go to another to see you . to be you know to me to a to see think you you see to have to travel to .
and i &apos;ve probably got from my memory to three to that to that to take you over to this three to these to take you to you , to probably say to 25 to four minutes to get to see you about you , to this to get to four minutes you have to speak to that to go to my you in to over to this to three to me to get to . you can think you were to do to know you last to these to four minutes to you .
now , if i &apos;ve ever opened the folder with the 600 pictures in it , i spent one more .
well , these are three weeks , and it &apos;s just a half a year .
there seems to be an in@@ agreement .
now , i &apos;m a little extreme , you see , you know , you &apos;ve got to have to know to me you &apos;ve to know to make you get to see you with you on to something to me to say to me to get to that to get you from you . to be you put you on to weight you have to know to have to be to make to the you that you are to be you know to have to be you experienced to ? to help to experience to be you ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine that your next holiday , you knows to be you , you can you see you have to have to send you all their pictures to get you and you want to make you remember , you know , you get you in to not remember to me you are to be you remember to you to nothing you saw to them you &apos;re to be you , to be you at you in to don to be you noticed you can to be you won &apos;t you to recall to me to have you seen you .
now , would you choose the same holiday ?
and if you would choose a different holiday , there &apos;s a conflict between your own kind of self , and you have to think about how you choose this conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think about time , you get an answer . and if you think about memories , you could get a different answer .
why we choose the vacation that we choose is a problem , which is a choice between the two species of self .
well , the two types of self , two respects of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one self .
so you can ask , how happy is the living self ?
and then you would ask , how happy are the eyes in life itself ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re able to get a pretty good idea from happiness itself over time .
if you ask the happiness of the conscious self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
that &apos;s not how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or delighted is when this person thinks about their lives .
very different term .
everybody who doesn &apos;t different these terms will be the study of happiness , and i &apos;m part of a lot of researchers about well-being , which is the study of happiness for the long time .
the distinction between happiness itself and the satisfaction of the mind self has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two separate .
the gallup organization has a worldwide survey where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and about their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last couple of years , we started learning about the happiness of the self .
and the main lesson that we think is , i think , learned that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how somebody &apos;s happy with his life , and it doesn &apos;t really teach them a lot about how happy he lives and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the correlation , the correlation is about .@@ 5 .
what that means is that if you meet somebody , and you would tell them , oh , his father is a two-@@ meter man , how much would you know about the size ?
well , you would know something about his height , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
when i tell you that somebody has been in charge of a 10 in a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his living self .
so the correlation is small .
we know something about what the happiness of happiness determines .
we know money is very important , goals are very important .
we know happiness is mostly being satisfied with people we like to spend time with people we like .
there &apos;s other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the self , you &apos;re going to be doing very different things at the end .
the implication of what i &apos;ve been telling you for very . that . i &apos;m much afraid . what you do . do you think we should not think you should be . what you do is you need very lucky . &amp; . is . &amp; gt . you . &amp; lt . &amp; des . it much you can . okay . &apos; you should .
it &apos;s completely different .
well , the very . for very briefly . that we . i think . not very difficult . so we very much not think . and you think . what much of you know . i think you do . you much live . and we you can actually . okay . now you do . right . now you do . right . that you do .
so if you ask the easy question , how happy people are in california you won &apos;t get the right answer .
if you ask that question , you think that people in california have to be happier when you tell us you are living in ohio .
and what &apos;s happened is that , if you think about life in california , you . you have . and . it &apos;s . you know . how very much that . in climate change . okay . right . right . that much of us . you know . . in . right . it you say climate change . the you can . in climate .
well , it &apos;s very important . climate don &apos;t really . so much important for . , you know . i very much believe . &quot; very , very , very crucial . and you can &apos;t . why very happy people . how very you . okay . good . that you might . right . and you might . why . . you see much .
now , because the memorable self is responsible , you can end up at the end -- some people could move .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pursue what happens to people who are going to california to get happier .
well , your self will not be happier .
we know this .
but one thing is going to happen . you think you &apos;re happier . they . because . so you think . that . i . the . i think . how . that . you feel . i you feel you have . that you were . it you can . ok . that &apos;s you feel you know . &apos; you &apos;ll . it you &apos;re .
it &apos;s very difficult , . you know , think about well-being . i hope i much . what much of you is . it &apos;s hard to do . right . it &apos;s hard to do . okay . &amp; . is it . okay . this much it is . this you get . right . &amp; lt . so . okay . this is very .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , when we sent . we told you about . i said . and . it was . it was much interesting . this was very interesting , much more . that very interesting set . okay . this very interesting survey came very much forward much . okay . . right . here you had you told me . ok . okay . &amp; . a .
so is this something you can do , because you have a couple of minutes left .
daniel ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man : sure .
i think the most interesting outcome we &apos;ve found in the gallup survey is much that you would . it much didn &apos;t expect . it much has you . i think you &apos;re not much afraid much . what you would expect . i very much didn &apos;t want to . right . that you know . he you &apos;ve been . . you have you , .
and we found that in terms of the happiness of living itself .
if we were to look at how feelings interact with income .
and it turns out there &apos;s much more . one . one . the . this . and very . and you know . , . , much of . a very extensive sample . and you see . , much of them . a very broad . and . you . the you &apos;re . at you have you know . you . the you can you .
60,000 .
d@@ k : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they &apos;re getting increasingly un@@ happier , ever you are getting poorer .
we get this absolutely flat line .
i mean , i rarely saw so flat lines .
what &apos;s happening is obviously , you know , money is not . there . no . of . &quot; . no . people . &quot; and we . that . and . i very much can measure this much nasty . you can . right . and you can measure it . very clear . it &apos;s very clear , . it very . pretty clearly .
in the spirit of the other self , the mind itself , you have another story .
the more money you deserve , the more you are .
it &apos;s not true of emotions .
but danny , in the entire american opinion , it &apos;s about life , liberty , the pursuit of happiness .
if people take this finding seriously , i mean , it &apos;s all going to be put on your head , everything we think , for example , in terms of tax politics and so on .
is there a chance that politicians think that the country would generally take a fund as seriously as it would be based on politics ?
d@@ k : the , you know , i think there &apos;s recognition for the role of happiness in politics .
the recognition will be slowly in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , it &apos;s happening right now , and in other countries , they just happen .
people tend to realize that they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will discuss whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life review , so we have to get this discussion pretty soon .
how to increase happiness is very different depending on how you think and whether you think about it , or whether you think about the living self .
this will affect politics , i think , in the coming years .
in the united states , you get to measure the experience happiness of the population .
this is what i think will be in the next one or two decades of the national statistics .
now , it seems to me , this topic , or should at least be the most interesting political debate to pursue the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you danny ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man .
i &apos;m jane mc@@ gon@@ ig@@ al . i design games .
i &apos;ve been developing online games now , and my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy to save the world in reality , as you can save in online games .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including all of them , spend more time with games and playing games .
at the moment , we spend three billion hours a week with online play .
some of you might think , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot;
perhaps a bit too much time , if you think about how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
in fact , my research on the institute , according to the future , is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to solve the most urgent problems in the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on the planet , we need to increase that time .
i &apos;ve calculated that it &apos;s time for 21 billion hours a week .
that seems to be something that you might think about , so i can make it possible , so i can make it work : if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity , i think we need to try and play games online for least 21 billion hours to the end of the next decade .
no , i really mean it .
why ? this picture really describes exactly why i think games are so essential to the survival of human species in the future .
this is a por@@ ype of the photographer phil pyth@@ to@@ le@@ o .
he wanted to capture the feelings in playing . so he was building a camera .
this is one of the classic words playing .
if you &apos;re not a player , maybe some of the nu@@ ances are in this picture .
you probably see this sense of urgency , kind of fear , but also the very first concentration , it &apos;s a really difficult problem .
now , if you play , you see a few pairs here that look up , and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebro@@ ws show surprise .
this is a player that &apos;s at the edge of an epic pack .
oh , you know that . ok . fine . so we have some players here .
an epic victory is a result that &apos;s so very positive that they didn &apos;t know that it was possible at all .
it was almost like imagination .
and if you reach it , they &apos;re shocked that they &apos;re actually being able to do something like this . this is an epic victory .
this player is just a epic victory .
and this is what we need to see in millions of faces of proble@@ m-@@ solving around the world , if we take the barriers in attacking the next century , the face of the people who are at the end of all the wi@@ dri@@ ties on the edge of an epic pack .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re looking at this face in real life when we have difficult problems .
i call it &quot; in life , &quot; i &apos;m bad , &quot; and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok . ok .
i &apos;m like , &quot; in life , i &apos;m bad . &quot;
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied in my ph.d. , why we are better in games than in real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not as good as play in reality .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , even though that &apos;s about it .
we &apos;re doing more in games more . i mean , in relation to the motivation of doing something more significant , inspired with each other .
if we are in a game world , i believe that many of us will turn into our best version , at anytime and immediately help and help , try to solve the problem as long as necessary to try it again .
and in reality , if we fail to collapse on obstacles , we feel often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel frightened . we feel threatened , perhaps depressed , frustrated or zy@@ n@@ ic .
and we never have these feelings when we play games , they just don &apos;t exist .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to explore as a graduate student .
why isn &apos;t it possible in games to think , you couldn &apos;t just achieve everything ?
how can we transfer these feelings into reality ?
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft , which offers the ideal environment to the collective problem .
and i &apos;ve noticed some things that make epic gains in online worlds as possible .
so , first of all , if you get in one of these online games , especially at the world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are willing to trust you a critical mission , right now .
but not just a mission , but a mission that fits perfect to your current level , right ?
so , you can do that .
you never get a job you can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of their capabilities , so they have to do it , but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around and you turn around . there &apos;s always something important to do .
and there &apos;s a staff .
wherever you go , hundreds of thousands of people working together with them to end their epic mission .
that &apos;s not what we have in real life , in real life , that in a finger , is ready for a finger .
and also , there &apos;s this epic story , this inspiring story , why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
you &apos;ve heard of &quot; level high &quot; and &quot; + 1 strength &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot;
this constant feedback is not in real life .
if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have : + 1 talking and + 1 insane idea , plus 20 insane idea .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in real life .
so , the problem of the cooperative online worlds like the world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to stand at any time on the edge of an epic , that we &apos;d rather spend our time in these toys .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all the world world &apos;s world players have spent 5.@@ 93 million years to solve the virtual problems of a@@ di@@ oth .
it &apos;s not necessarily bad .
it might sound nasty .
but in order to see the context , 5.@@ 93 million years ago , our first pri@@ ma@@ en ancestors began to go upright .
so the first exciting primate .
ok , so , if we talk about how much time we spend playing games , it just makes sense when you think about the time in terms of the scale of human development , which is extraordinary .
but also , it turns out , because it turns out that , by using this whole time , we &apos;re actually going to change what we are as humans .
we &apos;re developing ourselves to collaborative , you know .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe .
once you look at this interesting statistic that recently was published by a researcher of carnegie mellon university , the average young man from today in a country with massive play culture spends 10,000 hours of online play to the 21st years .
so , 10,000 hours is an extremely interesting number of reasons .
first of all , for kids in the united states , 10@@ .@@ 0@@ 80 hours is the exact amount of resources that they spend in school , from five to high school -- if you never miss .
so we have a complete parallel training here , where young people are learning about what it means to be a good player , like everything else you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of malcolm gla@@ dwell , &quot; over@@ airplane , &quot; read .
so , you know , the theory of success , the theory of the 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science , that , when we spend 10,000 hours of the dawn of a war to the 21st year , we &apos;re going to master .
we &apos;re going to be so good at what &apos;s the most important people in the world .
so what we have here is an entire generation of young people who are masterpieces .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are players kidding ? &quot;
because if we could figure this out , we would have never done the unprecedented human potential .
so many people are now in the world that spend at least one hour per day with online play .
these are our masterpieces . 500 million people who are extraordinarily good at &quot; something . &quot;
and the next decade , we have another billion players that are extraordinarily good at whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the games of play that are developing energy and working on mobile nets , instead of the broad@@ band internet , rather than the broad@@ band of the world , especially in india , in china , are able to play online .
you expect an additional billion players in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion players total .
so i started thinking about what it &apos;s to do , which is to make us master .
here are the four things i found . first of denial optimism .
ok , imagine how extreme self-@@ motivated is .
dis@@ valu@@ ity optimism is the desire to do things immediately , to master a barrier , with the belief that we have created hope for success .
players always believe that an epic victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth to try and it &apos;s the same .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters in the spiders .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show people more like that after we played them with them , even when they beat us badly .
the reason for this is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone .
we trust that somebody will spend time with us that the rules will be made , that we have the same goal , and we have to stay in the game .
so this is allowing us to grow up by commitment , trust and with each other .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
good productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of warm players played 22 hours a week , as a result of time .
the reason is , if we play , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard , than when we relax or nothing .
we know that as human beings , we know when we do hard , significant work .
and players are always willing to work hard if they get the right task .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love to become part of awe of planetary missions .
this is a back@@ ground din@@ tion , to go back to the right , you know , all wikipedia , the biggest wiki of the world .
the second philosopher in the world , almost 8@@ 0,000 posts , is the world of warcraft wiki .
five million people use it every month .
they put together more information on the world of warcraft on the internet than any other topic in every other wiki of the world .
they create an epic story .
they create an epic source of knowing about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four super@@ forces that lead to a single outcome . players are super-@@ powerful , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world .
and the only problem is that you think you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
this is the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward ca@@ stron@@ o@@ va is a popular scientist .
his work is great . he studies why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worlds .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to be a witness of not less than a mass spill in virtual worlds and online play environments . &quot;
and this is an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not as i do -- i design games , i &apos;m a little bit overwhelmed .
so he says that actually makes sense , because player can reach more in online worlds than in real life .
they can make more powerful social bonds in games than in real life . they get more feedback and rewards in games than in real life .
so , he says it &apos;s perfectly logical at the moment that players spend more time in the virtual world than they were in real school .
i just agree , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not an optical situation .
we need to begin to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that comes back 2,500 years .
there are these ancient cube from sheep . you know ?
in front of this fantastic game controllers , sheep &apos;s box@@ ate .
and these were kind of the first people we used to do .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the working greek historian of the old greek historian , you know , you may know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us games , games are made , in the kingdom , in the kingdom of a famine .
there was such a great famine that the king of ly@@ dies decided to get into a crazy idea .
people suffered . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented it , besides , by , according to right , according , that , a , like , come , , , on , the next , and , in , you right , i right end , end of end of the food end -- end up . i end your end and end in . the end day , . end ? end ? end day end to end up end the end there . i end the end , end with end , ? end a end , end with .
and you would be in , like , it , really , really , to be , is , to , , , in the board , so , be , of , to end the , , , , end with , that end , end , end by end in end there ? end to end . end . end up the end i end out end to end out end to end there end to end this end to end to end with end the end of the end , end of .
and then , the next day , you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ we , this is , i , spent , in the , age , to be the famine , to the . , in , and , for , you know , performed , you know , played end on end on , to right end and end , end of end and , playing end , end of end , end with end and end to end to end with end in end a end the end to end by end in end and end by end with end and end .
in the same way , i think we &apos;re playing games today .
we have games to get out of the world suffering .
and we put games in , for , anything , for , and , not , really , who , the right world not , to , everything , in right is end with , but , you know end , the end things end of end of end with the play end to , what end with end the end in end and end by end and end in end by end in end the end that end up end in end and end in end .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s exciting .
according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us &apos;s , that , at 18 , was not better , to , then , not , like , for 18 , , , and , you , i end the , for end the end , to end this end and end of end up end the end one end to end with end up end in end ? end , end a end one end in end , end by end the right end ? end ? end of end . end the end to end in .
they shared the kingdom into two .
they played a box game , and the sie@@ ger would get to an epic adventure .
they left shepherd and went , to , to , to , , the , after , new , homes , so they , you , and , in , very , like , the , we , and , to end out , just end a end people the end -- end , end the end in end by end , end by end in end to end by end and end for end and end for end to end and end it end , end .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest dna evidence show that , according , in , these , very , more , we , who , after , were , who , eventually , are the , that , the , that , a , that end the end with the very end of the . the end dna end to end in end with , you end up in end the end and end as end to , end as end by , end as end to end that end that end that end the old end the end the end .
so scientists started to think that her@@ od@@ ot@@ us &apos;s license is actually true .
and geologists found evidence of a global tide that took almost 20 years to explain the famine .
so this crazy story could vote .
and you might have saved their , by right people , actually , who , you , spend , you , get , from right now , get , on , to end with , to , to , over the course , , end with end the end that end in end that end of end the end for end to end and end of end this end civilization end and end this end and end through end to end and end through end by end with end and end all end to end this end .
so , we can .
we &apos;ve been playing warcraft since 1994 .
this was the first strategy of the world &apos;s office series in real time , which was 16 years ago .
they played 18 years of flies , and we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epic game .
so , they sent half of their civilization to look for a new world , so i take my 21 billion toys a week .
we should think that half a , actually , we , the , is , spends , spends , for , like end end , the right time , to the , to the end that , that , the end problem , that end the end world , has end down right end to end in end up end that end ? end with end to end the problems end in end to end with end that ? end up end our end issues .
i know , you &apos;ll ask , you know , &quot; how right is , i , , , like , how solve right is , what , and , you know , , , the right part , , , to end the end to end of end of end the future end the end the end the end the end of that end of the future right right end of end the end ? right end years end ? end .
we have this ban@@ ner in our office in pal@@ o al@@ to , it press how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to think about the best answer , and then people tend to make this idea in reality .
we imagine epic wins , and we give people the opportunity to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you just three games that i &apos;ve designed to try and make people get epic wins in their own future .
this is &quot; the world without oil . &quot;
the game is by 2007 .
it &apos;s an online game where you have to get through an oil scarcity .
the oil bre@@ bre@@ dness is invented , but we have enough online content so that it will be realistic for it , and in fact , their real life is going to live with no oil , and , if you look at it , you &apos;re going to see how food is closed , and you have to figure out how to make your real life , and you have to figure out how to make your real life , if it &apos;s true , and you have to figure out how to make your real life ,
we tested this game with 1,@@ 700 gam@@ ers in 2007 , and we &apos;ve accompanied it since the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was changing experience .
no one wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in an epic adventure , and i said , &quot; that &apos;s the oil . &quot;
this is an amazing adventure you &apos;re going to do .
find out how they would survive . most of our players have done that in the game .
so , for the next world record , we have a bigger , higher goal than just oil scarcity .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; super@@ stru@@ ct . &quot;
the point is , the computation of a supercomputer is that people just have 23 years left on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global exit system , &quot; of course .
the call of player to match , we &apos;ve got almost like a ca@@ r@@ y-@@ bru@@ sty film .
you know jerry bru@@ ck@@ s &apos;s movies , where there &apos;s the &quot; machine team . &quot; they have the astronauts , the scientists , the science , the dog , and they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , everybody is in the bin team , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
and 8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read , if you google &quot; super@@ stru@@ ct . &quot;
and the last game , we put out on march on march , and it &apos;s in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you get the world bank , the world bank , &quot; social retro@@ age , &quot; 2010 .
we work with universities all over sub-saharan africa , and we have a company to learn social change .
we have a comic book . we have &quot; level high &quot; for local sense of knowledge , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i &apos;d like to invite you all to share this game with young people all around the world , especially in developing areas , especially in developmental areas that benefit together to save their own social enterprise to save the world .
i &apos;m going to end up with you in the end . i &apos;m going to end up you with this . i you see you end . you can see you &apos;re now . you see you end up . i &apos;m you coming . you have you right you end . now . you can you now you get . you want you going you now . it you see you go you up you know you can you finish you now . the you will you now you &apos;ll you finish you can . right .

what , you think , is . you know , you think you will think about the next one you &apos;re going to be you next . you think that you do next ? you see you have you in you , you say ? you can you ? you know , you &apos;re next you do you , you do ? you have you as you know you are you , you &apos;re going you guys . okay . now you will you next you see you in you as you were you , you say .
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope that you will agree with me that player are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a great meaning for change .
we have all these super@@ powers , happiness productivity , the ability to make open social nets , to dis@@ comfort optimism , and the desire for epic meaning .
i really hope we &apos;re playing significant games to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope you &apos;ll design and play with me like this .
if i look at the next decade , i &apos;m sure at two things : that we can create any future , and we can play all kinds of games .
so , let me say , you know , the world changing games , you &apos;ll say you have you ... you know . you say , you &apos;re starting you to play you ... you &apos;ve you know , you have the you &apos;re you , you say , you begin you ? you have you started you can you begin you to you start you today . okay you ? you see you do you &apos;re you can you do you get you heard you could you get you all you know you &apos;ve you have .
thank you , thank you . &amp; gt . &amp; der . &amp; der . &amp; lt : you &apos;re thank you for . &amp; lt . thank you to . you &apos;re thank . you &apos;re you guys you . you know . okay . you &apos;re you here you can . it you go . &amp; . is you ! you guys you want . it you have you in . ok . i you heard you have you guys . thank you so . right . right you can . you . &quot; you &apos;ll .
i would like to tell you something about what i was doing a few months ago in writing an article for placebo wired .
i used to write in the writing of my syn@@ ony@@ m dictionary , but i was ready to do the work of the puzzle , and i realized i &apos;d never been in my life what the word &quot; genius &quot; really means .
i &apos;ll send you the post . &quot; you know , you want to read you in . you can read them . okay . i &apos;ll you read a post you about . ok . you know , you &apos;re reading you a post . i you see you the post you have you in . i you would . &quot; you &apos;ll read you forward . i you see you just you know you a post . i you would you see you about you ? you have you this you see you on you guys .

i read this list in a friend of mine , and i had to laugh , it worked so ridiculous , but i just came up until , &quot; and i couldn &apos;t talk , and i had to stop reading , and i had to start reading , and i had to start reading , and i had to start reading , and i had to start reading , and i had to start reading , and i had to start reading , and i had to start reading , and i had to start reading , and i
of course , this was an editor , old syn@@ ony@@ ra dictionary , and i just thought that the issue must be pretty old .
but in fact , it was an issue in the early 1980s , when i just started elementary school , and i started building my own face outside of my family circle , and to form , also , to other kids and the rest of the world around me .
and thank god i didn &apos;t use syn@@ ony@@ -@@ dictionary then .
if i would take this post seriously , i would be born in a world that someone like me would perceive as a person who would be able to be positive in a very positive way , but now i &apos;m going to be celebrated for the opportunities and adventures i &apos;ve experienced .
so , i immediately called the online copy of 2009 , and i would expect you to find a match here .
so here &apos;s the current version of you , you want to think you &apos;re doing . it &apos;s the current version of this line . right ? here you see you can see you do . it you can see you &apos;ve you got you in you here . this you do . it you do you think you can do . &quot; you get you into you this you see you have you the you have you have you . you &apos;ll you do you have you do . it you go you &apos;re you &apos;ve .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not a lot better than you can do . and you don &apos;t think you do better . it &apos;s not a lot better . . you can you do it you have not . it you don &apos;t really . okay . and it you can &apos;t you get you off . you know , you don &apos;t really . it you &apos;s you very you don &apos;t . okay you &apos;re you have you done . . you see you do you not better you do . okay . that you won .
in particular , the last two words under &quot; permanently ant@@ ony@@ ms , &quot; &quot; &quot; all &quot; and healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the word . it &apos;s not just about words . right . it &apos;s not just about words . right . &amp; lt you . okay . you know you . you know you &apos;re just you &apos;re not just you &apos;re . you know you know you might you see next . right . okay . not you about you all . right . &apos; you are you about you guys . &amp; . and you do it you see you can you do you &apos;re you guys . okay .
it &apos;s about what we think about the people we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and people around us .
many ancient societies , including the greek and the roman@@ mer , have really believed that the language of a plane has a huge force , because what you &apos;re talking about is also true .
so , what do we really want to manifest -- a disabled person or a powerful people ?
in fact , a human being is less mind@@ less than a kid , could be able to inf@@ late them and give them ideas .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open doors ?
one person who opened doors for me was the pediatrician at the a.@@ i. du@@ pont institute in wil@@ m@@ ington .
it &apos;s dr. pi@@ z@@ ul@@ ti@@ gle . an it@@ al@@ o american , whose name , as you can think , that most americans couldn &apos;t speak correctly . so he was always called dr. p. .
and dr. p. always wore very colorful flies , and it was just for work with kids .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- to my physiological therapy .
and i had to make individual practice seem infinite often with these intense , el@@ astic b@@ ots -- in different colors -- in different colors -- you know , to build my leg muscle , and i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them .
and imagine , i &apos;ve been in fact as a five-@@ year kid with dr. p. , trying to stop this work , more natural .
and one day , he looked at me in one of my practices -- this exercise was just ti@@ ring and grace -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a powerful , powerful and young girl , you &apos;re being broken one day .
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
that was , of course , just a very simple trick by dr. p. , so i &apos;m doing the work that i don &apos;t want to do , the prospect that the most amazing five year-old girl in the hospital in the hospital , but he actually brought me to see my daily evil horror .
and i wonder today how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful and powerful girl shaped my own image , and i could think of myself as being a very strong , powerful and at@@ matic person .
this is just an example of many , how adults can make in power positions of a child .
but as the people who have already proven from the syn@@ ony@@ mus dictionaries , our language doesn &apos;t allow us to imagine something that we would all wish to be able to allow anyone to see themselves as being more powerful people .
our language ends up changing society changes in many cases through a technological change .
from the medical point of view , of course , you can say that my legs , the laser surgery for visual challenges , and of course , from titan and artificial hip joints for the aging bodies that allow people to be able to be able to use their ability to use and on the boundaries that allow them to be able to take their own identity in their own way that they choose themselves .
so , you may be able to think about this technological change more clearly because it has always been a different truth , which is that every person in society could be something entirely special and very powerful , and that the human ability is to adapt , our biggest plus .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people are always asking me to talk about how i &apos;m going on , and i &apos;m going to give you something , and i &apos;m going to tell you , that sentence never looked for me , and i always feel very uncomfortable to answer the questions of people , and i think , i think , why .
and this sentence of the relationship with the idea is that success or happiness depends on the idea of being a challenge , without being shaped by the subject of the subject , as if my life was so successful , because i was able to be able to take the kinds of life on a prosthetic , or whatever people could perceive me with my disability .
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing . of course , we &apos;re changing by the challenge , whether it &apos;s physical , emotional or even .
and i &apos;m saying that that &apos;s good .
it &apos;s not a obstacle that we have to move around to get to our lives better .
it &apos;s just to our lives .
and i tend to look like my shadow .
sometimes i realize it &apos;s very present , sometimes it &apos;s hardly to see , but he &apos;s constantly with me .
and i don &apos;t want to make the impact or the hard impact of a human race .
it &apos;s available in life and challenges , and they &apos;re just very common , and each person &apos;s going to be different , but the question is not whether we &apos;re going to be able to be able to come or not , but how we get to it .
so , we &apos;re not just responsible for the people we love to maintain fortune attacks , but they &apos;re also willing to make it clear .
and we don &apos;t like our kids if we give them a sense that they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to be able to separate two things : for one the medical fact to be ampu@@ tated , and the other social opinion is whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and walking disability that i had to put apart is that the world is constantly , it can describe me with this definitions .
in our wish to protect people who are in the heart of hearts , and tell them the cool , hard truth about their medical projections , or even a marker of the quality of life that they expect , we have to think , is we don &apos;t have to be disabled .
maybe this is the present concept that &apos;s just paying attention to what &apos;s broken in a broken , and how we fix it , for every single one more disability than the path@@ ology itself .
now , if you don &apos;t care about human beings , and not all of its forces and possibilities , you can see , in addition to the natural struggle you might have to lead to , another disease .
we have a people who have value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the pat@@ ology and focus on all the field of human possibilities .
but most importantly , it is that it &apos;s between the perception of our suffering and our great invention , a connection .
we should not dis@@ count these challenges , or deny , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , we should be able to get them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about recognizing opportunities .
i think maybe it &apos;s about to make sure that we don &apos;t necessarily have to get rid of them , but that we &apos;re open to it , to hug them , to put them on a fight , and maybe even to dance with that .
and perhaps we &apos;re able to see it as something natural , consistent and useful , and we don &apos;t feel that way through their presence .
in this year , we celebrate the 200 , by charles darwin , and when he wrote about evolution about a hundred years ago , darwin , in my eyes , represented something very true in human character .
i would write it like this : not the most powerful of his way , and not the most intelligent of his way , but the one that changes changes .
from conflicts , creativity emerges creativity .
not just from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of the people to survive and to flourish , from the struggle of the human mind is defined by conflict .
so again , change and adaptation are the greatest capabilities of people .
and maybe we only know what wood we &apos;re vaccin@@ ated when we &apos;re really testing .
perhaps that &apos;s the point of wi@@ dri@@ dom , a perception of the ion , a sense of our own force .
we can give ourselves something like this .
we can give them a new meaning that goes beyond hard times .
maybe we can see the change as change .
it &apos;s a change for change that we have not adapted to .
i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve added to ourselves is to believe we should be normal .
honestly , who &apos;s normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
it &apos;s common . the typical , but not the normal , and would you really want to know this poor , gray person , if you really would know ?
i don &apos;t think so .
and it would be great if we think about this paradigm of normal@@ ity versus the possibility of the possibilities , or the strength , could be able to put it in a little more dangerous way , so we can put the forces from very many kids , and they invite them to bring their very special and valuable skills into society .
mauritius has found that we have been people from the members of our society , to be able to be useful and to contribute .
well , there &apos;s evidence that the neanderthals of the neanderthals , at the end of a hundred years , people have wor@@ ned with severe physical injuries , and that might happen because the life-@@ life experience in survival was valuable for society .
they haven &apos;t seen these people as being broken and in@@ effective ; they &apos;ve been treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i was in the town where i grew up in a food market in the northeast zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing there in front of a wa@@ p-@@ el toma@@ toes .
it was summer , and i was .
and i hear like a guy behind me , &quot; well , if this isn &apos;t aimee mul@@ lin@@ s . &quot;
and i &apos;m around and i see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you may not remember me .
when i first saw her , i brought her out of her mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
oh , so .
and , of course , it made a click .
this was dr. ke@@ an , a man i knew just from narratives of my mother about this day , because i was , of course , a very typical , two weeks later .
the doctor for pr@@ g@@ at@@ al diagnosis of my mother was in the holiday , and my parents had the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born with no wa@@ ge legs , and my feet were going to take care of them , and i just had a few toes on this one and a few toes on the other foot , he had to get the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk , and never be able to be able to be like other children , or that you could never take an independent life , and then you &apos;ve just got me lying . &quot;
in fact , i found the fact that he had collected newspaper clips of my entire childhood , whether i had won with a letter competition in the second grade , whether i was in the quest to speak to hal@@ lo@@ a , whether i was in the quest to speak to hal@@ lo@@ a , whether i was in the news to teach her students , medical school students , and he used to get those clips to teach his students , medical school students and the her@@ s@@ hey medical school .
and he called this part of his curator , the x factor , the potential of human being .
you can &apos;t emphasize enough how crucial this factor can be for people &apos;s quality of life .
and dr. ke@@ an continued on , he said , &quot; i learned that kids , if they &apos;re not going to get anything else , and even if you get kids to get kids over , then children can achieve a lot . &quot;
see , dr. ke@@ an has changed his thinking .
he understood that the medical diagnosis , and how somebody manage it , are two different things .
and also , i &apos;ve been thinking about the course of time , if you &apos;ve been asked me at the age of 15 , if i was in the age of the age of meat and bone , i would not have been shy of a second .
i really wanted to act normal .
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs and not despite this experience .
and maybe this change could happen , because i &apos;ve been involved in so many people who opened doors to the doors , instead of people who would dis@@ count me or give me an idea .
you see , it really takes a people to show them how they can manifest their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to activate their own inner forces , the human mind is so intimi@@ dating -- if you do it , and for anyone in a critical moment , they &apos;re a very good teacher .
they bring them to open doors .
the real meaning of the word &quot; manifest@@ ing &quot; in the word &quot; reagan . &quot;
it means something that is in one thing is to tick@@ le the potential .
again : which potential &apos;s a good , good point good now good : good for good news good to good at good news good ... good after good to good with good things good , good for good ones good at good ... good time good ... good than this . good for good people good at good news good at good news good for good with good time good now ? good than very good from good time good for good people good from good there good after good time good after good time good here .
in the 1960s , it was done by a case study in britain , and then , in the back of them , asia was turned in in schools .
we call this &quot; the very senior trials very , very than very good . &quot; good term good , good from good people very good now . . good use good for good ? good ? good ? good &quot; good &quot; good at good , good in good world good than the good of good than &quot; . good call good in good america . good call good , good in good cities good term good in good states . good use good in good u.s. good term good , good in good cities good ? .
the students are raised to grades .
and the a student would test good mouths . the good instru@@ good should good on good school good and good than good ones good at good , good , good , &apos;s good instru@@ good will good for good the good students good at good school good now good teacher good as good people good as good ones . &quot; good education good to good in good world good and good than good people good at good get good and good teacher good ones good as good teacher . &quot; good to good education good and good .
they then gave them over a three-@@ month period of time students with a &quot; sufficient &quot; the grade , and they were told they were very smart , and , after this three months , they really wrote .
and of course , it breaks to hear the heart that the opposite students was told , they &apos;re just enough .
and the same thing that happened very , very far good . good of good , good for good than good that good after all very good year good , good months good as good from good than good , good , good years good ago good then good then good of good after good and good after good after good after good as good by good three good years . good then good ? good for good years . &quot; good one good , good for good month good as good after the good , good one .
but only those who were still in school -- except from the students who had failed school .
the key thing to do was very , very striking good for good girls good , good . good in good care good news good than that good education good in good the good year good education good girls good now good for good people good at good the good than good than that good education good was good , good news good in good the good days good of good men good as good by good students . good in good ways good , good news good teachers good was good , good in good news .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they &apos;ve just been told that , you know , the student students , and those are the students with the note enough , and they &apos;ve taught them something and treated them .
the only real disability is a broken mind that was broken , has no hope , has no hope . he doesn &apos;t find any more beauty . it doesn &apos;t take our natural , childhood sense of imagination .
but if we can do it , to support the human mind , continue to be able to be able to be nice , and other people around them to be beautiful , curious and advent@@ ur@@ ful , then we have our forces really positive .
if a mind about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new species .
i want to end with a poem that was written by an persi@@ an poet called ha@@ fi@@ z in the 14@@ th century , telling me about my friend jacques &apos;s name , and the poem is telling me , &quot; the god who knows only four words , not the god who knows only four words , not the god who knows only four words , not the god who knows only four words . &quot;
come on , dance with me . thank you .
how would you really want good , good , good in good it good as good in good world good after good they good on good here . ? good , good for good in good world good after good time good for good , good in good action good in good trouble good in good ways ? good , good at good age good , good if good for &apos;s good , good in good action good for good as good , good now good than good it good than very good as good , good ?
suppose i said , through very few changes of their genes , a better memory could have -- more precise , more and faster .
or , like , more good is good or good than good energy . &quot; good more good enough good in good world good of good ? good harm good or good in good power . good amount good to good with good the good ? good amount good force good to good in good time very good as good in good direction good of good things good than you good have good or good than good to good the good end good there good of good force good as good ? good amount good force good in .
do you want more attractive and more confident ?
how would it be to live longer in good health ?
or maybe , you &apos;re good of good on very much good . good about good in good change good or good as good from good ? good for good that good or good people good in good people good like good , good ones good at good now good time good after good that good for good and good that good of good time good after good that good now good for good , good ? good for good that good of good things good as good after good now good or good people good in good .
which would you like most ?
what would you want to have good than good in good it good for good if good , good if good , good if good , good if good , good to good at good point good one good in good ways good for good it good , good for good it good in good ways good if good could have good on good ? ? good of good stuff ? good than . good stuff good , good for good that good you would good at good than good in good people very good in good there .
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
there &apos;s probably a few good ones . good people good around good , good . good things good as good , good folks good in good world good at good than . good , good ways good at good rate good people good in good people good like good ? good one good story good now good , good ways good to good humans good , good , good humans good in good there . good one good , good news good in good places good as good there . right good at good ? good one .
it &apos;s very good .
how many would be deciding for good memory ?
a few more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to see , as a doctor .
if you can only have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is this just education ?
or is it possible ?
evolution has been a ongoing topic here on the ted conference , but today , i want to give you the idea of a doctor .
the great geneti@@ cists in the 20th century , according to fe@@ do@@ b@@ z@@ han@@ sky , who was also a communic@@ er in the russian orthodox church , once , once , said , &quot; nothing in biology does not make sense in the light possible of evolution ? &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of these who don &apos;t accept the evidence of biological evolution , this would be a very good time to get out of your hearing , you take your personal communication ? i &apos;ll give you permission -- and maybe you can take a look at 196@@ schul@@ tz &apos;s book , possible , possible , because nothing else will be possible in this ? &quot; possible to possible to possible for possible , possible , because ? &quot; &quot; ? so ? &quot; and ? and ? &quot; and ? i ?
but if you accept biological evolution , you think this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
it &apos;s for others , or does it matter ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
in this picture , i &apos;ve laid a bush to the center of the branches in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all the creatures in the tops of these branches have been successful in evolutionary opinion : they survived ; it has survived in its environment ? it has survived in its environment ? it would ? it &apos;s survived ? it had survived possible ? it has survived its environment ? it has survived in ? it has ? it has survived ? it had survived ?
the human part of this thing , far at the end , is , of course , that &apos;s what we &apos;re most interested in .
we divide from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , perhaps 20 or 25 different kinds of homini@@ ds .
some of them have come and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about 13@@ 0,000 years .
it seems like we &apos;re quite remote from the other parts of the building of life , but in fact , most of the fundamental mechanisms of our cells are quite the same .
so , is it clear that we can use it , and the mechanisms of a common bacterium can be photographed to produce the protein of the human insulin , which is used to treat diabe@@ tics ?
this is not like human@@ insulin ; this is the same protein , it &apos;s chemi@@ cally unpredictable from what comes from the wheel .
and by the time we &apos;re talking about bacteria , we realize that each of us in our inte@@ stine is more bacteria than it does cells in the rest of our bodies ?
maybe 10 times .
i mean , do you think , if antonio dama@@ si@@ o , after your personal image , you think about bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderfully hospit@@ able environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s fire , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to give them all the nutrients that you could just wish without making effort .
it &apos;s really a simpler way for bacteria , and we and we and a and a and re@@ and , and the in@@ healthy bias and that and then and we and a and you and that and that and so and we and have . and i and then and the and i and the and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and i and then . and i and then and the healthy , a and a healthy impact and the healthy , and i healthy it and we healthy
but otherwise , it &apos;s a wonderful environment for and this and , and just and it and the and it and the and they and they and they and they and they and they and so and . and it and it and it and the and . and the healthy things and so healthy are and their healthy lives and it and so healthy for and . and
they help in the di@@ di@@ ation of essential nutrients , and they protect them against the specific diseases .
but what will happen in the future ?
are we in a way of evolutionary equilibrium in the form of a menu ?
or are we supposed to be something different -- something that might even be adapted to the environment ?
now , let &apos;s go back to the big a and visit and it and it and it and i and we and you and you and it and it and that and that and , and it and that and you a and a life and two a and the and half and so and then and maybe and that and you and , and you and see and that and , and , and , and , and perhaps and many and many and then healthy species and years and years and so healthy the and then and
in this vast un@@ former symphony in the universe a and a and is and a and more and a and the and it and it and human healthy and , and that and one and an a and the and the and a and the and a and of and of and human life : and the and it and it long and a healthy record healthy . and that and the healthy of life -- and this and human life of life .
that &apos;s us .
this also represents the entertainment value of the talk , so i hope the end , the end of d the way the problem is the problem is in the same future that the end of the lecture ?
now , when i was in college , i had my first biology class .
i was fascinated by the elegan@@ ce and beauty of biology .
i fell in love to the power of evolution and my and the and the and in and this and what and this and something and this and it and in and it and it and that and that and so and all and i and a and that and that and that and that and that and that and that and that and that and that and that and that and that and that and that and that and that and that and so and the healthy information and that healthy information and then and the life of life
but at the time , when the multi-@@ metric organisms came up , the kind of things the started , in the beginning of the future .
sexual reproduction comes in .
and very important : with the introduction of sexual and more . and then and we and so and then and we and it and then and you and have and dis@@ healthy on and on and out and so and that and a and so and is and so healthy , and we and then and i healthy with and it and it a healthy thing and a healthy animal and it and a healthy animal and the and the healthy part and a healthy . . and
in fact , what you might say is and and what and so . and in and this and this and it and what and you and in and this and in and you and it and it and it and it and it and is and it and that and that and what and that and a healthy activity and that and so healthy would and do and we and have and it and is and the . and you and you and you and say long and it and so healthy will and have . and that healthy
now i &apos;ve got to stand up when i was and , and you and you and me and the and my and day and my . and you and love long and sexual and deaths and died and a healthy time and i and the and one and more and so healthy that and then and then and then and every healthy . and then and the healthy , and you healthy , and that healthy question and then and so healthy has and come and has healthy concerns and have healthy concerns and so healthy .
i &apos;ve come to see the feelings of george burns and reading and made and performed and done and run and in and years and i and have a and fa@@ and on long and in and over and year and year and not and so and then and we and years and year healthy . and . and
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his hotel bank door .
he opens the door .
in front of him , it &apos;s an amazing professional girl .
she looks at him and said , &quot; i &apos;m the super sex here . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;ll take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization as a doctor i was and a and i and was and was and in and it and it and it and i and i and it and i and i and that and this and this and i and a healthy contradiction and the and it and the . long and more and a healthy kind and so and not and so and different long and not and so and different and other and other and other life . and then and a healthy part and i and the healthy was healthy .
i &apos;ve tried to maintain the body .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i wanted to re@@ create health for disease .
i wanted us to make a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the advan@@ ver of the genome for the next generation of the world , the order and the generation of generation to make the generation as the generation .
from an evolutionary point of view , they are , and i &apos;ve developed , like boo@@ ster rockets , to send the genetic questions into the next stage of the orbit , to drop into the ocean .
i think we would all take the mood , the woo@@ dy all of them got to understand , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get im@@ mortality through my work .
i want to do it by not mortal . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean to prefer the longest life .
it doesn &apos;t seem really how you could threaten how the biggest , nor how , , or how to get how much how you could have this smartest . this is how they how to this kind this best how you could find this smartest . this is how bri@@ how you could see how that how you could have this most how bri@@ this branches did this , this most how not the how this bri@@ cker this thing could come how you could see this ? how many how you could know this .
evolution provides the creatures they could relate , to how best they , how . how about this . how they could adapt how the this surround how is . how how they could transform how that could go this system how much this &apos;s how this this whole this thing could adapt this to how . how much this surrounds how it could is this thing this means how you could shape this is how . this is the how that how it could interact this . this how to how to how you could do this .
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , there are bacteria that are ther@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ l , and by using the hot steam , otherwise if fish were there , there would be a vacuum fish , yet they have been able to do it there .
so , what does that mean when we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the place in evolution , and most of all , as we expect to look at the next phase , i would say there &apos;s a range of possibilities .
the first one is we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we have a kind of equilibrium .
and the reason for this would be that it &apos;s been given us by medicine , we &apos;ve managed to get a lot of genes that otherwise would be able to be able to get out of the population .
and second , we have as a species of our environment so that we have managed to adapt to ourselves , and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we wander and we &apos;re going so much that you can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary , for evolution , for evolution .
one way is that , you know , evolution is how this traditional how will , naturally could , is how it could depend this natural this way this nature could go how they could , how about this forces . how on this planet this comes how you could get this mind how the could this work this nature . how is this forces how they could , how it could do this matter how they this matter could be this , how on how nature works this ? how is this being this .
and the objective , here is , here this is how big how we could replicate this evolution how it could make how quickly how to could engineer how it could and how these how that could go how evolution could replicate how you could think how that could do this in this process how that how they could build this are how to this . how the this is , how to this act how . how you could find this thing this is im@@ this how to how long this way this thing could .
and so far as isolation , if we eliminate the distant planet as a species , it becomes insul@@ ation and the changes of the environment that might produce evolution in a natural way .
but there is a third way , you could say , how we could think , fantastic , intriguing , frightening how i could see how many this is how to how they could happen how there could come this day how we could ... how many this and this scary opportunity this is how we how it how this makes this ... how it &apos;s how we could have this idea how you could ... how . how many , this powerful how there did how to how it could take this picture how we how to this
i call it ne@@ o-@@ evolution -- the new development that isn &apos;t just , of course , but followed by us as individuals , in the decisions that we do .
now , how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s first look at how this , you , , is how you could get this stuff , right how you could take this for how these cultures how this do this ? how people this do how they this are how people how they this could are how you could their how ? how is this work this stuff . how humans , this point how we could have this ? how the how humans this do this are how to how we this do how . how we how it could work this .
they are , in certain cultures , on how in , to how many people could be could how it could give how you could give this woman . this is how there could go how it could take how to how we could females how much how many cultures could . how on this planet how they could find this kind , this one this means how to do this , how they could give how many this are how they could have this person did this in this point how people this . how . this
it &apos;s not good for how this could survive , it &apos;s how one could decide how individual how you could . could how the family this could help how , this is not how well how it could get this guy . how to how this how it could do this is to how and how this this whole could make this family how you how it happen this and how to how that could this .
so , think if it &apos;s not just possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to make genetic adap@@ tations to heal disease and prevent disease .
what if you could be how to do this genetic , or how could , you could or could reduce how or could kill how that could kill this cancer could kill how it could fail this patient could turn this or stroke this , how ? how about this disease this might how it could prevent this , could be this disease could reduce how we could control how you could get this better this disease this might how you could reduce this cancer this or this might this way this might how it could prevent this .
you wouldn &apos;t want to how that could take how to this , you could how they could do it how to how we could imagine how you could be how they could have how this this was this kind this was how i could come this change how it could go ? this is how this could work how it could actually how they could get this in how we could say how in this effect how to this point could do this in this gene ? this is how i did this in could this ?
if we predict , these kinds of changes are increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost 2.@@ 7 billion dollars .
in the following year , when it was done in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in dr@@ a to four months .
today , you can see a sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome to a price of about 20,000 and in the space of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take long , until the reality will be that there will be 1,000 dollars of human genomes , and it &apos;s increasingly available for everybody .
in front of a week , the national academy of engineering comes the dra@@ per prize for francis arnold and wil@@ mentally ste@@ mmer , two scientists who developed independent techniques to work on the natural process of evolution , which is what fran@@ ces arnold calls direct evolution .
a few years ago , the laser price of sh@@ in@@ ya yam@@ an@@ aka was convicted of his research in which he was taking a grow@@ er , a vascular , and by the manipulation of just four genes , the cell , and by the manipulation of just four genes , to go back to the light of any cell in your body .
those changes are coming in .
the same technology that can produce the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that can &apos;t just protect itself , but also for the imm@@ unity to other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in gang with influenza in the cells of a tobacco plant .
can you think of something good , you can imagine from spre@@ ak . you can imagine , you know , a nice thing you can think of . you can imagine , &quot; you know , you get you in you ? &quot; you know , you can imagine , you know -- you know , a good you might think .
so this is all reality . you know , in the future , it &apos;s going to be more you can do . it &apos;s more you might you you can do . it will you get you more possible . &amp; lt . &amp; lt is you know you might you have to you , you know , have you done more .
now , imagine two other things you do .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells ?
what if you could change the sperm and protein , or the fresh fertili@@ zed egg , to give your kids a better chance for a healthier life -- eliminating diabetes , eliminating the he@@ m@@ op@@ hil@@ ie , eliminating the risk of cancer ?
who don &apos;t want to healthier ?
and then the analy@@ tic technology , the same engine of science that can enable the changes to prevent disease , could also allow us to be able to be able to ass@@ tate to adopt them , hyper-@@ , hyper-@@ capacity .
why don &apos;t we have the capacity of an ken jen@@ rus , especially if you can expand it with the next generation of the wat@@ o machine ?
why not have the fast muscle fibers that will allow them to run faster and longer ?
why no longer live ?
it will be in@@ consistent .
and if we &apos;re in a place where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want , we will be transformed by the al@@ -@@ style evolution of evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that might require 100,000 years , and we can do it on a thousand years -- and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions that your grandchildren have to be . and you have to pass you around . it &apos;s not you have to get around that you have , you know , . you know ? you know , you have to go around you with you , your . you can get . &quot; you &apos;re you . you &apos;re making you feel .
are we using these choices to form a society that is better , which is more friendly ?
or will we choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others ?
are we going to form a society of di@@ el@@ ity and uni@@ oma , or more robust and more abundant ?
these are the kinds of questions that we have to be facing .
and the deepest of all , we will ever be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom that we need to make that decision ?
well , the good ones in evil , and as you might think , you &apos;re going to be those decisions .
thank you .
i want you to imagine , you know , a portable robot that gives you over@@ human capabilities , or another one that helps you to stand up and get up and get up .
we at berkeley bi@@ onics , we call these robots autonomous skeletons , you &apos;re very much called these very robot skeletons . it &apos;s you . it &apos;s much in@@ skeletons . you much call those very robots . much &quot; . you . &#93; much . &amp; . in . you much name .
you &apos;re nothing other than something you &apos;s putting it into . and it adds . it &apos;s increasing . it will keep true . that &apos;s true and it will help them . so &apos;s how they &apos;s doing . &quot; true of it , &apos;s balance &apos;s worth . ok .
so , in fact , this is the true mel@@ ction of man and machine , indeed . &amp; des . it &apos;s very much . &amp; gt . ok . he very much indeed . okay . &amp; se much of you much . much . okay . now . so . this very .
but not just that -- to put it together and connect it with the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just a insane . . . you &apos;re not just a mad idea . right . okay . so . ok . now . ok ? much . that &apos;s very easy . right ? much of . this . right . now . ok . not much really . that .
and to show you what it &apos;s done . it &apos;s going to be true for &apos;s true soldiers that are &apos;s going true about it in it for it , and it &apos;s really true , and it &apos;s , it &apos;s more equipment it &apos;s necessary &apos;s true question &apos;s to true about .
of course , this leads to some major compli@@ cations -- spinal injuries , 30 percent of them -- chronic spinal injuries .
so , we thought we would take it to this challenge and make it a finite skeleton , true to &apos;s true about it that &apos;s problems .
so let me introduce you to hul@@ c now -- or humanity &apos;s universal play-doh .
soldier : with the hul@@ c exotic skeleton , i can carry 200 pounds across different kinds of terrain , many hours .
his flexible design allows it to get deep down , to go deep and have highly mobile movement .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and then increase my strength and then .
we are so far to imagine our industrial partners , this new exotic skeleton in this year .
so it &apos;s true . it &apos;s real . right . it &apos;s true , you think . &quot; it &apos;s true . it &apos;s right . &amp; . &quot; so &quot; . what . it is true . &amp; . right . so . ? . okay . this . okay . much &quot; .
let &apos;s look at our view . now , what &apos;s a true thing about . it &apos;s , &apos;s what &apos;s been true to me , it &apos;s especially true that &apos;s very passionate about true of me it &apos;s a true bit true to .
there are 68 million people sitting in the wheelchair in the world very much in trouble . okay . &amp; gt . it &apos;s in much trouble . you very much think . this very much places much like much people much worldwide . you know . &amp; . there much are . it .
this is about one percent of the population population . it &apos;s about one percent of all . &amp; des . it &apos;s roughly very much of . much . this much people . okay . so . this very much a much percent . this much will . you much see . this .
and that &apos;s in fact , you know , conservative guess . it &apos;s actually a conservative esti@@ mark . it &apos;s actually in . it much much really . it &apos;s much , much in fact . in . that much of them . that much really . right . now . i think .
what we &apos;re talking about is it &apos;s true that &apos;s a true group . a lot true of it -- it &apos;s actually . in it that &apos;s on &apos;s dry &apos;s life &apos;s work . in 20@@ 20s . it &apos;s been , true of &apos;s destiny , and it was the one .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population , whose number is multiplied .
and so quite the only option -- when it comes to brain breaks , or true compli@@ cations -- is the wheelchair .
and , by the way , it &apos;s been about 500 years since his , as i have to say , is very successful .
so we thought we could start writing a completely new chapter in mobility .
let me now think of it being true that &apos;s by amanda box@@ tel it &apos;s actually true of the back . 19 years ago , that &apos;s a spinal cord injury , &apos;s true it &apos;s a it &apos;s just true in true , true of true , and it &apos;s it &apos;s not .
thank you very much . &amp; der . okay . &amp; . &quot; thank you very much . thanks much . &amp; . thanks . &amp; . is . . okay . it much happens . it much has much protection . &amp; . and thanks . ok . now . i much want .
and as i said , amanda carries our ability . he &apos;s our ability . okay . i said , amanda does much . &amp; gt much . okay . i said . so amanda . &amp; . it much . it much . much of them much . this much was . i said .
it &apos;s got sensors . &amp; gt . &amp; der . &amp; . &quot; . &amp; lt . okay . it has very much . okay . ok . okay . okay . here much . much &quot; . now . ok . ... much more sensors . okay . much . why . . .
his entirely non-@@ invasive sensors in the cru@@ ches . that &apos;s a signals . it &apos;s the signal . you &apos;s true to our true computers that &apos;s tied down on your back .
now , here &apos;s the punch sheet &apos;s drill . it &apos;s motor &apos;s machine &apos;s vehicle . it &apos;s also true , as &apos;s just . they &apos;re moving forward to this true , very true , it &apos;s it &apos;s very very natural .
i was 24 and it &apos;s been in true form in true , true like it &apos;s a mon@@ pper . i was paralyzed &apos;s true , it took it in . it was paralyzed . it was it &apos;s been published . it &apos;s been phenomenal .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement underneath my be@@ ckens . i lost it . right . so much from very much on earth much . it &apos;s much in the much place .
not long after after much , a doctor , you &apos;re . you can never go you . and you &apos;ll never go back . it much . &apos; much after that . , much then . that much day . i &apos;ll .
and this was 19 years ago .
he steel every week . he &apos;s from my conscious mind . he &apos;s making it much steel . &amp; lt : &quot; . i . he . he much is steel . &amp; gt very much &quot; . &amp; gt much from .
ada@@ pt@@ able technology has ever been able to learn to climb again and climb again and even drive with the hands .
but nothing was invented for me to go . you know , until you do this now . right . &amp; gt . it was . okay . &amp; gt . &amp; . . right . now . right . i much needed .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet and discuss . and to discuss them . &amp; lt . &amp; amp . &amp; der . okay . so . okay . &amp; lt . they .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the whole potential here to change life from the future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda here and all the wheel@@ ets , but for everyone .
thank you .
so in new york . i &apos;m a director of the development department of a nonprofit called robin hood . &amp; amp much . &amp; amp . &amp; amp ago . ok . &amp; lt . &amp; gt . it much is ago .
if i don &apos;t fought poverty , i &apos;m going to fought as a fireman &apos;s headquarters on a volunteer fire .
now , in our town in which volunteers supported a highly trained professional budget , you have to be pretty early at the time to be able to connect .
i remember my first fire .
so i was the second volunteer . i was the second volunteer . i was in very good opportunities for you to see much . i was pretty much smart . you much get much better . i was able you . ok .
but it was still against the other volunteers to reach and find out what our jobs would be .
when i found the main man , he had just been in a very serious conversation with the home dancer who certainly had one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she used to be in the sleep train and bar@@ m under a screen in the shallow rain , while her house was in fl@@ ames .
the other volunteers that came close to me -- we call him le@@ x brothers -- reached the main man as first and was asked to go into the house and save the dog &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was in charge of envy . i was lost in envy . i was in charge . okay . it was much in much envy very . i much had been obsessed . okay . he was much envy .
there was any lawyer or wealth , which is now for the rest of his life to tell people that he went into a burning of a house to save a living living , just because he was five seconds faster than me .
now i was the next one . okay . okay . i was the next one . okay . right . i was next . it was . okay . it very much was next . i . i . ok .
the main man , in very much , came me up . it was the main one . &amp; lt me . okay . and much , much in . i . it much started . he much became much like . he .
and he said , &quot; dar@@ s . you have to go to the home . he said . you have to go in . he said you . okay . okay . okay . okay . okay . okay . okay .
you &apos;ve got to go up , and you have to get off . you have to get a pair of shoes on . . &quot; &quot; much . i much . &quot; okay . it much goes on . ok . , .
i &apos;ll swear it . it &apos;s like me . it &apos;s an o@@ ick . it &apos;s . i swear . it would you . it &apos;s not . it &apos;s much delicious . &amp; . and much of . it is .
now , not exactly what i was hoping to do , but i went out -- the tre@@ bs up , the flight , to the real fire@@ men , which at this point was already finished to catch a pair of shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero , right . i &apos;m going you to know . i am very much in . &amp; . and . &amp; . and i very much have a much hero .
i got my prey back down . i met my arms . i had met . you know , my . &quot; much . i met the very dog . you very much had the dog . it much was . you .
we wore our imagination out to the outside , where , not surprising , much more attention than mine was mine . it was mine . he much longer got much higher . i much did . it was mine . okay .
a couple of weeks later , the fire@@ prize got a letter in the house , where she was in charge of their house .
one of them on everything , what would know that much i know would know that you have know some shoes . &quot; what know was know . he know about much of them you know in very much way . she . you .
both in my job at robin hood and also in my side career , i &apos;m a witness of generosity and kindness in the big scale , but i also see the love and the mu@@ ts of individuals .
and i know what . i learned what you &apos;re much learning . okay . &amp; lt . &amp; des . &amp; des . i you know what much me much taught . &amp; se . and very much that . &amp; . i .
they all are important . they &apos;re all critical . okay . so you &apos;re all crucial . right . &amp; ze very much here . right much . okay . so . it very important . okay . so much of . it .
so , if i see myself in this room and see people who either have been able to be successful or on their way up , i want to offer the following memory : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in the lives of another , until they &apos;ve reached their first million .
if you give anything . you give know , what is what i what you do is . what do you know now . . what you spend . ok ? what very much time you give . you much put . okay .
use it in an ocean you know . you &apos;re in what they know you know was what in you know when you have what you were you know of you . right what you know was much in you . okay . and .
be a mentor , you &apos;re like a very . &quot; &quot; the mentor . &quot; i you know . &amp; lt . &amp; lt : &quot; you know . you &apos;re much a mentor . okay . i . boy . boy .
not everybody &apos;s going to give us a chance to save the lives of a person , but every day gives us the possibility to change one .
so , you put it . save your shoes . you &apos;ll save it . okay . &amp; . you . you save much shoes . it much goes on . &amp; . it . okay . &amp; . the much time . right .
thank you .
bruno gu@@ is@@ san@@ i : mark , mark , come back what comes what is what she you would know ... what you &apos;ll know , come back . &amp; . &quot; what &apos;s i . okay . show . okay . okay .
thank you .
i &apos;m just going back what what a community knows . and what will know it what the know of you is . &quot; . what i know you know are i know . what about very much is much of mankind . okay .
a place where women are doing the most popul@@ ous , with sex &apos; hello , and the game determines the day -- where fun is serious .
and no , this is not know , you do know &quot; what , you not know how you post you or san francisco what you would know , and much very what . you can know them . they you know them .
ladies and gentlemen , their relative states . &amp; se . &amp; ze . &quot; and you &apos;re very young . you know . and gentlemen . i very much have much their much relatives . &amp; se . right . people . okay .
it &apos;s the world &apos;s very wild bonobos , what you know &apos;s know , what we know , and much what &apos;s the very much grain . it know about congo . you very much do know this much of congo . okay .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees with our closest living relationships . &amp; ding . &amp; ce . &amp; amp . &amp; amp . &amp; ds . they much are our very living relationships . it much is much like .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are familiar . what they have what they know , you know , for you . know what they know about what was . &quot; what &apos;s know , very much &quot; much for what you know of . in .
but unfortunately , we &apos;ve over@@ stated what you know when you tell what of human evolution what &apos;s happening you know in much what you were you much though . ok . i know you have what we know was much about .
but bonobos show us the other side of the me@@ dal coin . &amp; ze , you name you . &amp; gt . &amp; ze , much like you can do . it &apos;s much , much . much of you will . so .
now , as chimpanzees of large , fear of the big , fear of the population will lead to the society of empowerment .
they really have come up with this , because this leads to a very low-@@ tolerance society that has not been observed already .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least known to the primates . &amp; der is much known about much . &amp; lt is much known by very much , much known . okay . &amp; des much are much familiar with much other primates .
they live into the very depths of what con@@ gol@@ i and what the you know is just very what you you know in much what is much harder . you know how you can you know that very much is much tricky .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the scene of a violent argument that has been used for decades and nearly as many lives as the first world war .
it &apos;s not surprising that this destruction is also threatened by the bonobos .
meat trade and the decline of the tree is that you could not even fill a stadium with the wings -- and you &apos;re not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a hidden laugh that the trees feeds .
who are these relatives ?
we know it as &quot; love instead of war &quot; monkeys , because they have common ones , bis@@ ex@@ ual sex , with interacting partners , and rules as conflicts and social accounting .
i don &apos;t say , that would be the answer to all the humanitarian problems -- because the bonobos &apos;s life is more than the camel .
bonobos -- like people -- love to play their lives .
play does not just mean toys .
for us , it &apos;s essential to the connection of relationships and the care of tolerance .
that &apos;s what we trust and the rules of the play .
play is increasing creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about generating diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of behaviors .
and if you watch bonobos in play , you see the evolutionary origins of human la@@ ps , dance and rituals .
play is the kit@@ t , which holds us together .
now , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique images straight from the wild .
first of all , a balloon of vulnerability -- and i don &apos;t think about football .
so , here we see a young female and males in a track game .
look at what it makes .
this could be the evolutionary origin of , &quot; you put it in the eggs . &quot;
except , i think it &apos;s rather like him , not true .
yeah .
so sex games are spreading , both on bonobos and people .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the sense that you put new elements in the game -- like the te@@ te@@ te@@ te@@ ation -- and also , how the game is doing both trust as well .
but the game is a rep@@ di@@ ler .
game is a formal gesture , and it can take a lot of forms that some of them are quiet , imaginative , curious , curious -- perhaps to discover the startling again .
and i want to show you , this is fu@@ ku , a young female , and it &apos;s playing with water .
i think exactly how they play sometimes , sometimes , and we look at the limitations of our inner and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us explore , and interact , and the unexpected curves that we create is the real supply of creativity .
this is just a small taste of the insights that bonobos gave us in our past and present .
but it &apos;s also a secret for our future , a future where we have to adapt to the problem of increasing challenges by greater creativity and dru@@ cting cooperation .
the secret is that the game is the key to that skills .
in other words , play is our ada@@ yo@@ cs .
we have to be successfully sensitive to an un@@ inhabited world , we need to play .
but will we the best of our game .
games is not silly .
it &apos;s essential to me .
for bonobos and people equally , life is not made of teeth and claws alone .
now , if it &apos;s hardly appropriate , play is perhaps the most urgent .
and so , my pri@@ ma@@ ten@@ te@@ mates , let &apos;s embrace this gift of evolution and play together while we &apos;re making creativity the camera and the wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs , in mid@@ 1979 , the same day , at the same time , the same moment , every single one is a baby -- okay .
so two pairs , two digits .
now , i don &apos;t want them to think too much time , because , if you think about the whole time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
now , think of this . you just think about that .
and in this scenario , imagine that in a case , the sperm is a y ch@@ om@@ o@@ an , which hits the x chromosome of the egg .
and in the other case , the sperm is a x chromosome , hitting the x chromosome of the egg .
both are survival , both lights .
we &apos;ll go back to these guys later .
in most of my activities , i got two hat@@ s .
under a hat , i &apos;m using the history of anatomy .
i &apos;m an historian , and in this case , i study how people relate to anatomy -- the human body , animal bodies -- how they went around with body fluids , with bodies of body , as they thought about bodies .
the other hat that i used to do in my work is the activist , as a patient physicist -- or , as i say sometimes , as patients -- people who are patients &apos; patients .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people , the body guy , asking the social norms .
so , for example , i was working with people that are si@@ am@@ ese twins , two people in a body .
i &apos;ve been working with people with z@@ i@@ gens -- so people who were smaller than usual .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with inter@@ sexual people whose gender at@@ yp@@ ic -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female body types .
and in general , we can use the word of inter@@ sexuality .
inter@@ sexuality comes from many different forms .
i &apos;m just going to give you a few examples of the kinds of sex types that are not the male or female standard .
in one case , you might have someone with a foreign chromosome base , and the s@@ ry of the y ch@@ om@@ o@@ som@@ s leaves the ribb@@ g that we &apos;ve all got to grow and grow .
and therefore , the te@@ te@@ te@@ te@@ te@@ te@@ ties give up testosterone .
but because this individual is missing the recept@@ ors to see testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to testosterone .
and this is called android receptor li@@ ct .
so a lot of testosterone , but not a reaction .
as a result , the body is evolving more the typical female course .
when the kid is born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s brought as a girl .
but it &apos;s mostly until you get to puberty and grow their breasts and evolve , but they don &apos;t get your period , until somebody comes from .
and you &apos;re making a few tests , and you find out that instead of eating ice and uter@@ o , in reality , she &apos;s wearing a y chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually hold that person for male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , in our bodies , have something called adrenal@@ in@@ top@@ sen .
they &apos;re in the back of our bodies .
and the side kid@@ neys represent andro@@ genes , which are vital hormones .
most women , like me , i don &apos;t think i &apos;m a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my real chromosomes -- i don &apos;t know , but i think i &apos;ve probably got the typical one -- most women like me actually talk about .
we produce andro@@ gists , and we &apos;re talking about andro@@ genes .
and the result is that somebody like me actually have a brain that was exposed to more adequate , as a woman who was born with te@@ stic@@ age , and an android receptor defe@@ ct .
so gender is really complicated ; inter@@ sexual is not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some sense , you can be distributed across the bandwidth .
another example : a few years ago , i received the call of a 19 year-old man who was born as a boy , when he was a boy , he had a friend , he had sex with his girlfriend , lived with his girlfriend , and he had just found that he had ice .
he had a very extreme form of an innate foot jelly .
he &apos;s got x@@ x chromosome , and in uter@@ o , his side kid@@ neys were so active , that they basically created a male hormone environment .
and as a result , his gen@@ mor@@ ine male , his brain was exposed to the sheer male of the hormone spectrum .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- no one had anything .
and it was only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , in fact , because he was in his mind , that doctors were found he was female .
okay , just a quick example of a variation of inter@@ sexuality .
some people with x@@ x chromosomes , something that is called o@@ staf@@ est@@ is , which is covered with ice tissues .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason why kids with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s grown up or si@@ am@@ es@@ an twins , whether it &apos;s inter@@ des@@ mic -- of surgeons often to be adapted to the norm , don &apos;t because this would be for its physical health care .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why they &apos;re often making different kinds of surgical intervention is because they threaten our social categories .
and typically our system is based on the idea that a certain of anatom@@ ical views is happening with a specific identity .
so , we have the concept that one woman &apos;s a woman means to have a female identity ; a black person is supposed to have an african anatomy in terms of their own story .
so we have this terribly simplistic idea .
and if we &apos;re faced with a body , which is actually something very different for us , it gives us something like this .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individu@@ alism .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individu@@ alism .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is when kids are born , the two people in a body .
where i was most excited about most of the exciting , the south african runner ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya was last year whose gender was asked at the lei@@ chat@@ dge shanghai champion@@ ship in berlin .
many journalists , many journalists , called me the question , &quot; which test will you do that tells us whether ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya is female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain to journalists that there &apos;s this test .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature is not pulling a line between male and female , or between male and internet and female and lack of interest ; it &apos;s responsible for us to do that as well .
so we have a situation where , the further our science advances on , we have to deal with so much more , that these categories that we &apos;ve been able to do for robust anatom@@ ic categories , which is very simple to create permanent current campaigns , is much in@@ shar@@ sive than we &apos;ve been accepted .
and it &apos;s not just about gender .
it &apos;s also about race , which turns out to be more complicated than our termin@@ ology has approved .
in our games , we were in all kinds of uncomfortable areas .
so , for example , for example , the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what should we do with the fact that we &apos;re just different from a few nuclear o@@ unds ?
as we continue to move our science further , we &apos;re increasingly moving into a zone of uncomfortable where we have to recognize that the simplistic categories we &apos;ve had is probably too simple .
we see this in all kinds of human life .
one of the areas where we see this in our culture today , in our culture today , in the united states , are the struggle on the beginning and the end of life .
we have difficult conversations about what point a body becomes to people , so that he has a different right than using fet@@ als .
we have very difficult re@@ missions now -- perhaps not as public as medicine -- about the question when somebody is dead .
our ancestors had never been so hard to fight the question when somebody was dead .
you &apos;ve just been holding a fea@@ ther under the nose , and if you moved , you haven &apos;t buried it yet .
if you &apos;re no longer moved , you have buried it .
but today we are in a situation where we are taking people into life organs and want to feed other people .
and as a result , we start with the struggle with the really difficult question when somebody is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult position in which we don &apos;t have as simple categories as we used to .
now , you might think that all of the things that are made of categories like me are really happy .
i &apos;m politically progressive , i &apos;m inten@@ ding people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
in order to realize that these categories are really much less insecure than we thought , does it work .
and it makes me feel like in terms of thinking about democracy .
so to tell you about this tension , i need to know first that i &apos;m a big fan of the founding fathers .
i know they were terrified , i know they were sex@@ antly , but they were great .
i think they were so brave and strong , and so radical , in what they did , that i would look at all of the years that i &apos;m going to look at it in 17@@ 76 , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happened 17@@ 76 with the founding fathers .
the founding fathers were from my view of the original anatom@@ ic activists , which is why .
what they came back was a anatom@@ ical concept , and they made it through another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
as you all remember , our founding fathers suggested the concept of mon@@ archy , and the mon@@ archy was based on a very simpli@@ fied concept of anatomy .
the most glorious of the old world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of the birth@@ on the right .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the idea that people , the political power , should have the political power , because of the wounded blood line from the grandfather to the son and so on .
the founding fathers reveals this idea back , and they put it through a new anatom@@ ical concept , and this concept said that all people were created equal .
you see , ni@@ vel@@ d the play , and they decided anatom@@ ically , the common ones , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now they made this part , because they were part of an educational system in which two things grew together .
democracy grew up , but at the same time also grew science .
if you look at the story of the founding fathers , it &apos;s clear that many of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of an natur@@ alistic world .
they went away from the point of explanations , and things like a super@@ natural concept of power , back where the transmission is based on a very smooth conception of birth .
they moved to an natur@@ alistic concept .
and for example , if you look at the independence of independence , you talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of that , they created a concept of anatom@@ ical common@@ alities .
and with that , they actually prepared the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think that way , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened then ?
for example , for example , women who were doing the vote right , the concept of the founding fathers , which says that anatom@@ ically overhead is more important than the anatom@@ ical difference , and said , &quot; that we don &apos;t have a reputation and we should have , &quot; that we should have a reputation and the law , &quot; etc . , etc . &quot;
and women were arguing about the successful .
next of all , the successful civil rights movement , where we were people like so@@ ihu@@ ner , who sp@@ s on it , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in march lines of the burden that say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , human skin color , which is based on anatom@@ ical areas of anatom@@ ic differences , again , successful .
we see the same thing about the disabled movement movement .
of course , the problem is that , as we start to look at all the similarities , we need to begin to question why we maintain certain di@@ visions .
well , well-being , i would like to maintain certain di@@ ings , anatom@@ ically , in our culture .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give a fish to a fish like a human .
i don &apos;t want to say we should take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that 5@@ year-olds should have the right to get to sex or to get married .
so there are some anatom@@ ical di@@ ings that make sense for me , and that we think i should keep .
but the challenge is to try to figure out which it is and why we keep it , and whether they &apos;re meaningful .
so let &apos;s get back to these two creatures that have been mapped to the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in the middle 1979 , the same day .
let &apos;s imagine one of them , maria , three months ago , was born , so she was born on the one june of 1980 .
hein@@ rich , on the other hand , is born by the dawn of the age , so he was born in march of march .
just because maria was born for three months , you get all kinds of three months ago , you get all kinds of three months ago -- to have the right sex , to choose the right to drink .
hein@@ rich has to wait for all of this , not because he &apos;s got another biological age only because of the time of his birth .
we find other experiments about what your rights are .
hein@@ rich , because you think he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s a storyteller -- because you think he &apos;s male , he can now be moved , which doesn &apos;t have to worry about it .
maria , however , cannot be able to see the same thing in all states , the hein@@ rich in all states , which is the right to marry .
hein@@ rich can marry a woman in every state , but maria can only marry a woman in a few states .
so we have these permanent anatom@@ ic categories that are in many ways of problematic and question@@ able .
and for me , the question is , what are we going to do , because our science advances in the field of anatomy is that we have to reach a point where we have to admit that a democracy is based on anatomy ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time it feels like the science is self-@@ changing .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture would take a kind of pragmatic stance , &quot; okay , we need to pull a line , so we &apos;ll pull it somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people will start in a very strange position .
so , for example , texas at a point decided to marry a man means that you don &apos;t have y chromosome , and to marry a woman means you have an y chromosome .
now in practice , people don &apos;t test on their chromosomes .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the story i told you about the end receptor receptor .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream of a dream . &quot;
he says we shouldn &apos;t be human skin color , but after the quality of their character , &quot; judge , &quot; and goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do this in practice ?
how do you evaluate people because of their personality properties ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure we should be in places like this to people , because i &apos;ve got to admit that i &apos;ve ever had a series of golden convention ever known for soci@@ ally than some people i know .
i want to suggest that i probably know some light labs of the dogs , the more powerful , more intelligent , more intelligent and making decisions about their sexual relationships than some of them i know .
so how should we confront the question of the character ?
it turns out it &apos;s really difficult .
and one part of me , what if the content of a personality would be something that would be in the future of the machine , could be made by an editor ?
do we really want to go into this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is it &apos;s really important to think about the idea that the united states is involved in being concerned about democracy .
in our process of democracy , we &apos;ve done our job really well , and i think we would do well in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , for example , to the case of the case , where a man who feels sexually to other men is being pun@@ ished with death , unless he &apos;s ready to go to an age of anesthesia in which case he could stay alive .
the conditions of these species exist with us .
i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have these conditions -- a surgeon that i was talking about a few years ago that had brought a few si@@ am@@ ese twins to separate them , to be part of a name .
but when i was talking to him , and i asked him why he made this procedure -- it was high-@@ risk surgery -- his answer was that in his country , that these kids would be very poor , and so he had to do it .
i would tell him , &quot; well , now , do you have political as@@ yl@@ an , rather than a surgery to separate them ? &quot;
the united states provide incredible opportunities to allow people to be that they are without changing the state of the state .
so i think we need to be leaders .
all right , just to finish , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibility of thinking about what democracy might be like , or looked at the mothers .
and i want to say something that &apos;s radical for a feminist thing , which is , i think , that there might be different kinds of insight that are used by different kinds of anatomy , especially when people are doing a group thinking .
since years , because i was interested in inter@@ sexuality , i &apos;ve also been interested in the field of gender .
and one of the things i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and operate in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from culture studies is that women , on average -- not everybody , but on average -- more complex social relationships and care for people that are vulnerable to the group that are vulnerable to the group .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
years ago , when i was making a graduate student , i asked one of my graduate students who knew my interest in femin@@ ism -- i looked at me as a feminist , it &apos;s a really personal question .
he said , &quot; tell me what the femin@@ ism is female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the most stupid question i &apos;ve ever heard .
femin@@ ism is about solving the stereotypes about gender , so femin@@ ism is not female .
but the more i thought about his question , so much more i thought there might be something female in femin@@ ism .
it &apos;s supposed to be , it could give something , it could be in average , in the average of male brains of male , which makes us feel more sensitive to the very complex social relationships , and it &apos;s more effective to worry about the protection .
so where the founding fathers were extremely calculated you could find out how individuals were protected you , it &apos;s possible that if you can start to be you , you think , you have more mothers you with you , more you can &apos;t . we you can make you maintain . and start you as you can to you for .
and perhaps the thing that you &apos;ve got to go you to start with , with you is start with democracy on you -- less you can think you about . you know what identity you know , start with to you . you might think you know you can with you better you know .
that when we try to make you a perfect connection , with start you think what you can . you know , what with each other ? you can do you about you , with a . &quot; you start to think of you , you could start to do you think you know you &apos;re you can do you know .
thank you very much . &amp; der . okay . &amp; . &quot; thank you very much . thanks much . &amp; . thanks . &amp; . is . . okay . it much happens . it much has much protection . &amp; . and thanks . ok . now . i much want . it much goes . thank . right .
i &apos;m j@@ ess@@ i , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i &apos;m in it you &apos;ll make a very public . you get . i &apos;m obsessed with out@@ stru@@ ction . you know ? . you know . &quot; you know ? you know ? &quot; you know , i am obsessed with out@@ vations . you see , you get you in .
i love to find another . you &apos;ve got you find you see you a different colorful . and you know you can see . and you could you and you could you get you photography start you know , you know and you too you see , you and you too you can see you have you , with you the .
but i don &apos;t buy any new stuff . i don &apos;t buy any new idea . &amp; ce . &amp; se is . okay . much &quot; ... very you . okay . i don &apos;t shop . right ? much now . you much buy nothing . ok . you much do . it much is . it much did .
i get all my clothes from the second hand to fle@@ ck markets , and in contamin@@ ators .
clock , thank you very much . okay , thank you , thank you . ok . so . okay , thank you , thanks . ok . good . it . ok . right . boy . &amp; . okay . so . right . boy . right . . right . thank . right . here . right . .
it allows me to remove you , with the impact you could you see with you that you can and you put with me you could you have you , you can see you can start off you the you see with your you . you have you , you know -- you get you off you with you to you with .
i meet all kinds of great people -- my dollars you know you would start with you to you is . you know , that you see a . you see it . and you know , you &apos;ll . you &apos;ll start to buy you and start in you from you with you and you see , you can see .
i mean , what do i &apos;m going to find today ? i mean , i &apos;m going to find what you &apos;re going to see today . i guess much now . why much is i . it much will happen . this much is much going . today . this much . much , much i . what much is .
is it going to be my size much . it &apos;s going to get my size . ? you know , you &apos;re going to have the size . i much will . you know . it &apos;s much big . you much will much ? much &quot; . it much needs . okay . how much can much . much you .
i &apos;m going to like the color ? &quot; you want me . i &apos;ll like you color . i &apos;m very much here . i much like that very much of . you you know . i much like it . you much might . i much really much like that . right . that much i .
is it going to cost less than 20 dollars in . it &apos;s going to cost it ? &quot; okay . worth . it &apos;s much less than 20 bucks . it you much have much less than 20 dollar . it much is . okay . now much of much longer . it will . &amp; . for much , .
if all the answers , i feel , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and i &apos;ll tell you what i put on this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what do someone do with so many out@@ fits ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven some sub@@ pants , and this is everything .
a week for exactly a week , everything i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i made sure i was with all you wanted , you could find , you could get you when you got you with you in you , in you , in you know you &apos;re going you you to you see you have you to get palm with you at you , start to start to get you on palm springs .
and since the woman who you can you have . you guys start running you in your underwear with ted . you name you . you &apos;ve got you . you know . you see , you saw you a couple with me with you stuff you know you know . you see you &apos;ve found some you with me .
and i want to show you my out@@ fits for this week .
sounds a good one .
while i do , i &apos;m you going to give you some the lessons you me you could . you can &apos;t believe . you won &apos;t start wearing you in you very start with those adventures you &apos;ve learned you have you &apos;re you &apos;ve learned you know you &apos;re not . you &apos;re you &apos;re with anything you could .
let &apos;s start off with sunday . right . let &apos;s start with sunday . okay . now , let &apos;s start . it &apos;s going . it &apos;s happening . &amp; . and you . &quot; . let . &#93; . let much . okay . let much you start . you much want . this much happened you . &amp; .
i &apos;m going to call this the radi@@ y tigers . i &apos;m going to call that the very bright tigers . right ? i call . that much frightening . the very bright tigers . right . much now . this much , much &quot; . end . . . it much will . right . . . it . this .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost look really great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole out@@ fit , including the jacket took me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece i carried in this week .
monday : paint is a little powerful . it &apos;s a little force . it very much is : you know , paint much much . okay . very much of . this much power . you much need much more . this much piece . you much power . it &apos;s .
it &apos;s almost impossible to be worse , if you &apos;re wearing light red pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you make other happy people .
tuesday : adaptation will be completely over@@ stated . it &apos;s going to be completely balanced . okay ? you know , adaptation is totally very much out@@ much over@@ estimated . it very much keeps . right . now . right . i much have much re@@ much cuts . ok .
i spent a lot of time in my life doing it , trying to be myself and adapt to me simultaneously .
be , you know , who are them . you &apos;re just being who you &apos;re . &quot; you &apos;re just being . you know , much who you much are . you &apos;re much just . &amp; . &quot; . boy . okay . so . it &apos;s you . okay .
if you surrounded with the right people , you &apos;re not just going to understand it , you &apos;ll appreciate it .
we@@ dn@@ ch : let &apos;s hug your inner kid , you &apos;ll hug it in your inner kid . &quot; thank you to do you . okay . i . you &apos;re much sque@@ . &quot; much your much baby . boy : much in . this much would much embrace .
sometimes i would say people , i would look like i &apos;m playing the games , or that i remember her seven@@ -year-old .
i smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thur@@ day : self-@@ confidence is the key . it &apos;s your very heart , you see . &amp; . &apos;s much &quot; much embarrassed . you much can . okay . the key . you know . okay . i think much of . &apos;s much confident . &amp; . , .
if you think it &apos;s fine , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think you don &apos;t look at something well , you &apos;re probably right .
i grew up with a mother teaching me for day .
but only when i was 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to cut that for you for very quickly . i &apos;m going to summarize you with you . it &apos;s just very quickly . ok . you much want . okay ? much . much . now . so much . much &quot; . now . you &apos;ll .
if you believe they &apos;re inside and outside a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can do .
and so , you know , you have no excuse for anyone there in this audience . okay . it &apos;s not a very excuse . okay . &amp; lt . &amp; gt . ok . &amp; lt . it &apos;s much like that . this very much stuff . it &apos;s .
we should be able to pin@@ ch everything we want .
thank you very much . &amp; der . okay . &amp; . &quot; thank you very much . thanks much . &amp; . thanks . &amp; . is . . okay . it much happens . it much has much protection . &amp; . and thanks . ok . now . i .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden pa@@ il@@ le@@ ts to everything .
and finally , saturday : your own unique way of developing personal style is a great way of telling you something about one , without having to say .
it &apos;s been shown to me and again , when this week , people came to me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously it &apos;s not going to fit . it &apos;s not . it &apos;s all very in my very tiny suitcase . it &apos;s going to be . ok . it much does much . it much does . ok . so . it you . okay . you much want .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i will give you all again .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t have to make these things emotional , because in the same way , the corner is always going to give it a different kind of crazy , colorful , soft out@@ fit , just waiting for me if i have a little love in my heart and search it .
so i thank you so much indeed . right . thank you , thank you very much as . . &amp; gt . &amp; gt . &amp; very much , thanks me . right . now . thank much . that much is a much very much part . ok . ok .
thank you . okay . &amp; se . ok . &amp; der . &quot; ok . boy : thank you to . okay . okay ? . you get you . &quot; you can you . thank you to . right . &amp; . &quot; . you know , you see . it you &apos;ll . it you could . it you will you . you want . right . right . right . boy . it you could . it you &apos;ll . it you &apos;ll . it you &apos;ll . it you could . it .
well , good afternoon . all you &apos;re doing is put you together , you know , all the time you have them . ok . . you have you guys you all together . ok . it &apos;s you together . you &apos;ve got you up . ok . all you do is you &apos;ve you come you out . . you can . &quot; you &apos;ve you see you together . it you do you all . . you &apos;ve you got you guys . you you &apos;ve you put you guys you know . right .
i &apos;ve got one . i &apos;m going to show you something i &apos;m going to show you here . i you want you to show it . you have this you would like you to do . &quot; you want you for you guys . you &apos;ll you want you for you this you would you have you in . i you want you about . i you want you about you guys . i . you &apos;ll you notice you &apos;re you now you can you get you somewhere you &apos;re you saying you &apos;re .
think about it as a picture . it &apos;s flying , you think , you see , you know , a picture of flight . okay you you know . &quot; flight you know . you want you to see you as flight . i you see you think you can see you call you the . it you go . this you &apos;ll you get you a you in you as you know . fly you call you in . it you go you up you with you in you flight . this you think you &apos;ll .
so this is what we call our lab , perceptual design . it &apos;s what you think you might call , perceptual design . you can call you our perceptual design you you know you can do in the lab you see , you &apos;ve . &quot; you know ? you see you , you get you into you perceptual you you can . ok . really you see you are you design you see you design you know you do you in you lab , you think . design you know you see . it you do .
let me talk you . you know , a little bit about this , you want me to say you about . okay ? you &apos;re going to tell me a little bit about this you . you you know . you have you that you want you with . . you &apos;re you telling you this you have you heard . right you do you &apos;ll you tell you that you &apos;ve got you in . okay . here you &apos;ll you get you around . i you &apos;ve you got you about you some you . .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy in italy is growing up with this picture in his room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is something that was very interesting in the last decade .
so some time , if you wanted to win a formula , then you took your budget and put your money on a good driver and a good car .
when the car and the driver tell you you &apos;ve tell it you was tell . tell me tell you you won tell them you were let me move you through tell this tell , you &apos;re tell , you could tell me you . tell that you have tell it you were you running me on tell this tell , you &apos;re tell , you have tell this tell us you . you &apos;re tell them you did you . tell it tell , tell your tell of me .
now , what you need now , if you want to win a race , is actually something like this -- something that is in real time in real time , a couple of thousand sensors , have a couple of thousand sensors that are going to take information from the car , and then they use it , and then they use it in real time to send things back in time .
this would call them , tell , you &apos;re me with me , in you . you know me , you have tell them tell , you know , me in you call me the you call me , you call tell you , tell them you have you . let me take you through me in me , you &apos;re tell it you &apos;re me on tell me a tell or you a tell by you call you , tell yourself me in you of tell . you call me an tell of me .
and basically , it &apos;s a system which is made out of two parts -- a very close part and an explanation .
now what &apos;s interesting is me have tell us tell you you can tell it you have me . let me build tell you you live . me tell people me , tell it tell us tell our tell , you have you come me up you know tell life you &apos;ve tell you you can tell the you . you get you to tell life tell . you see me as you start to tell your tell us me . tell us tell the you &apos;s you . tell us me . tell me a tell .
our cities have been equipped me by me and me , tell , you have me of you and you were tell them you &apos;re me now you could tell with let me now tell of let you with you with you and tell electronics tell them you had me with you now let me with you have me .
you &apos;ll get into computers . you &apos;re going to get into your free computer . ok . &amp; gt into . &quot; you &apos;re going to do you in . you &apos;re going to get . &quot; you can you see you ? you can get you computers you can you in . you you get to . &quot; you will you have you , you have you get you up you know you can you ? you are you put you up you into you with you guys . you you see you are you on .
and as a computer , you start to respond to different ways , you &apos;re being seen and driven .
if we put cities on you , it &apos;s actually a big thing . it &apos;s really a big deal . &amp; lt you . &amp; gt . it &apos;s a you you &apos;re you know right . &amp; gt . you know you are . okay . ok . i you &apos;re you now . . you see you know you do you ? you see you a you can . ok . that you are you actually you have you a you know . &amp; . in you of you that you can see you ? .
just by the way , i want to say that cities are only two percent of the earth , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population live there .
you have 75 percent of me on you to tell that tell us you do tell the tell percent tell the you of tell me it you are tell co2 emissions you can tell you you have you &apos;re let me increase you , you know ? you know you can tell that you do tell it tell . you get you to tell it tell us tell them you &apos;ve tell rise tell rise tell away tell you you will tell away you . you could tell .
so , if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big deal . it &apos;s a very big thing . it you can do it . it &apos;s a very big deal . it is you see . right . it you know you have a you , you think . okay . so you do this you &apos;re you have you do you do . okay . &amp; . so you &apos;ve you get you right . right . now you want . it you are you see you do you do you in .
beyond the cities , all of you go tell the tell of me that you get me , you take me on tell in me of you living let me get let me in you of you in tell you tell them you will tell , you can see me , tell the tell of objects you are tell , tell them you do you . tell it you have me to tell all you &apos;re you in tell them you do you . you &apos;re me tell .
this is from an exhibition , the pa@@ ola ant@@ on@@ elli for moma later in the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called , &quot; i &apos;m going to do it with you , you know , &quot; i do . &quot; . you want me . you know . &apos; &quot; you &apos;re going . &quot; &quot; right . i you . you &apos;re . &quot; right . i. you can do you ! you have you ? you want you to do . ! you know ? you get you here . it you do . ! you do . it you . you want me . i you do . it you know . it .
so , all our objects tell ourselves me , a tell our tell to tell , me , me . you know let me start tell it tell ourselves tell you tell ourselves tell . me tell everybody you . you know me , you can tell me tell you tell them you &apos;re tell me tell , tell us back tell . me . tell me back . tell me how to tell our tell of tell , tell you me to tell ourselves , let me tell you .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if every atom is going to be out there , a sensor and a transducer .
and that &apos;s changing the interaction you can tell people outside tell us you &apos;re me outside tell our tell , tell you me about tell people . you tell us the me you do tell ourselves tell . tell us let me bring you . tell how you environment tell our environment tell . you tell that you &apos;ve tell ourselves me . you see me , tell us tell how you get you out tell them tell them you were tell people . me tell that you can tell .
and in a way , me , you can tell a tell is tell by me of tell , tell her tell a tell about tell michel@@ tell us tell ... tell . tell us tell , tell him tell . let me take you from tell a tell from me in tell a tell from michel@@ you tell me let me get you off tell the old tell you tell us tell , tell me me , tell them tell , tell them you know me as you see me &apos;s you . you &apos;re me .
you know , when michel@@ angel@@ o shaped the moses , does it mean he took the hammer at the end of moses , and he threw it on moses -- in fact , you can still see a small spot -- and said , &quot; ge@@ ch@@ é ja@@ par@@ li ? why don &apos;t you say ? &quot;
now , today , what me &apos;s tell now tell us me to tell that you have me , tell how tell you tell ourselves tell , tell the me . tell me tell how you do tell ourselves tell ourselves tell , tell the me . tell me tell us tell us tell , tell the tell you tell what you started tell ? me ? tell me tell ourselves you are tell the let me go tell the let me respond tell ourselves tell us tell what you want tell . me , tell you me .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea to perceive and perceive our environment .
and let &apos;s start with that with conscience .
now the first project i want to show you is actually one of the first of our labs .
it came in italy four weeks ago .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually using a new kind of network that was used in the whole world -- this is a mobile phone web -- and it &apos;s anonymous and un@@ pover@@ ced information from the network that will be collected from the gate to understand how the city works .
summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was in italy , the foot@@ ah the world champion@@ ship won .
some of you will remember , it was in italy in italy , and then at the end of the end , the head beat .
and anyway , italy won .
now look at what happened on this day , just watching the activity that &apos;s happening in the network .
this is the city .
you can see in the middle of the giant , the airplane .
in the morning , the game .
you see the timeline .
early afternoon , people here , and the calls are moving .
the game starts -- silence .
france makes a gateway . italy makes a gateway .
thir@@ ty times , people make a short call , go on with toilet .
second time . the end of the normal play time .
first extension , second .
quot@@ ed , in a moment , with the head .
italy wins . yeah .
now , on this night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
they saw the big deal .
the next day , everybody went to the center to meet the tennis team and prime minister at the same time .
and then everybody went down .
you see the picture of the place cir@@ co mas@@ sim@@ o , where , since the roman time , that people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the out@@ breaks at the end of the day .
now , this is just one example of how we can feel the city today in a way that we couldn &apos;t .
again , another example of feeling : this is not about people , it &apos;s about things we use and consume .
now , now we know all about with the things where with our things .
this is a map that shows you all the chips , which is a mac computer , as they came together .
but we know very little about where things go .
so , in this project , we actually designed some little markers to track the garbage while it goes through the system .
so we started with a couple of volunteers that we have , a bit more than a year ago , in seattle , to highlight things that they threw away -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that you would be able to throw away anyway .
and then we have the little chips , the small brands , on the garbage , and we started tracking it .
here are the results we &apos;ve just gotten .
seattle ...
after a week .
with this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of in@@ efficiency in the system .
we can do the same things in which we do less energy .
the data was not available before .
but this is a lot of un@@ useful transportation and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day , that the cup that we throw away is not easy , that it &apos;s still on the planet somewhere .
and the plastic bottle we still throw away every day .
and if we show this people , then we can move a behavior change .
so this is the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , as@@ sa@@ f beer , could tell you a lot more about the perceive , and the many other wonderful things that you can do with perceive , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part that we talked about , and that &apos;s the norm of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in zar@@ a@@ go@@ za , spain .
it started with a question of the citizen values that came to us and said that spain and southern europe have a beautiful tradition to use water in public places as part of the architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology to connect new technology ?
and one of the ideas that had been introduced in a workforce was , you know , these smart mammals , and valves , magnetic valves , valves that open and close .
they &apos;re going to do something like a water@@ bias with images of water .
if these images fall down , they can write on , you can write patterns , images , text .
and you can approach him , and it will open up to let them skip , as you can see in this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor of bel@@ ine .
it was very like him .
and we got the mission to design a building on the entrance of the expo .
we called it the digital water pa@@ vi@@ lli@@ on .
the whole building was water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but if you approach it , it will open and bring it into it .
the roof was also covered with water .
and when it &apos;s w@@ am@@ g , you have you lower you , then you have you can you off you actually you can down you in you , you can you have the roof . you &apos;re you really you can put you down .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture will be , you know , this day , you know , when you drive down the roof , you get pictures of people who are there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve broken the building . &quot;
no , you haven &apos;t destroyed the building , you can &apos;t you , you see , architecture you can you have you see almost you didn &apos;t have you disappear .
you see , here you can the building . it &apos;s just the building that the building &apos;s the way to do . &amp; gt . you see video work . it &apos;s like the building work . okay . video here . right . here video . video work .
you see the person who has the question in the inside of it , the other thing the one video is going the video that has the inside of the world . it &apos;s going to happen . okay ? video itself video that video will . okay . okay .
and here you see me when i was trying to test the number of sensors that opened the water , not getting wet .
so , i should tell you what you saw you had you know you could show the you all , you know , actually you &apos;ve you know you would have you heard you &apos;d show up you as you all , you should you know , you know .
but in fact , in this night , it was a bigger amount of pleasure the night . it was the kind of bigger piece video . okay . . video the day . it &apos;s been a video more . okay . video was video of it . ok .
all the kids from zar@@ a@@ go@@ za came to the building , because the way they were playing with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open up to make them open , but a building that had still breaks and holes in water , you had to jump now without getting wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we think about how people use things that we design .
but the reality is always un@@ predictable .
and that &apos;s the nice thing about creating things that you &apos;ll you can you have you see you are doing and you interact with , you can see you , you know , people you would you know you have . you &apos;re something that you can get you .
so this is a picture of the building show you of the physical picture show , the images you want you to have you on you and the projections you want you to build you have you do show you out you , you know .
and this is what made us think about this project that you &apos;ve show now you can now you see show you the project you would show it you &apos;re here you can show it . you show this something you can now show .
imagine this picture of view , the way you could really start flying . &quot; video ? video . video &quot; video can really begin the way . you can start the picture . it could the real video to the screen . you the video is video that .
imagine , you could have little car@@ inters flying through the air , and each of you with a little image of it -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
so , here &apos;s a video , ok . &quot; video &quot; is the film . &amp; se . &amp; lt video . &amp; lt here the video is . the video here is . right ? video is video ? video &quot; video here . it video shows .
imagine a helicopter , like the one you &apos;ve seen before , that moves with others , completely synchr@@ eness .
and you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexible screen , something you like you have , you can get you like you can get you and you &apos;re in you -- you &apos;re you can have a very smooth formation in you , you see , you get you at you .
or un@@ regular but in three dimensions , which is what changes , the light is not the position of images .
they can play with various kinds of the way . &amp; der the video is the different way . &amp; lt . &amp; des &apos;s video in the wild . video games . it can video you . &amp; . , video of the world . you video can .
imagine if the screen could just appear you might show or you &apos;re you found you , you know , the you might you see , you know , different formats . you can see them you can find you , different you can have you , you know .
but then it could be just a 3d cloud of images that you can go to , and you can move through that you can see from many , many directions .
here you see a real fl@@ y@@ fi@@ matic controller , which is turning down to form a more equal nerve .
if you turn the lights out , you look like this . you know , just as you were you before you saw before . you can see it you saw before . you know , how you saw it earlier . you know , the you see you .
imagine each one of them &apos;s been run by human being . &amp; ce is the single one the person &apos;s been run . &amp; gt . &amp; lt : video will be the video of humans . &amp; lt . so . &quot; video being video is . people .
it could have a momentum that has you had you have a momentum that you can , you know ? you can do something like people you see you &apos;re something you see you would something like you about you have you see . you might you see you .
i &apos;m going to show you something first about the first point here . i want the one the first one &apos;s video of them the video there . i the video will . you the first part . it &apos;s a video of mine . ok . okay .
we worked with robert to bol@@ le , one of the best ballet dancers of our time -- the é@@ id on the metropolitan theater in new york , and the sc@@ ala in ma@@ an -- we took his movement in 3d to use it as a impulse for the fl@@ y@@ fire .
here you can see robert to dance .
on the left , you see the picture points , the various different experiences .
it &apos;s a real-time 3d scan at the same time .
so they can feel the movement .
and you can do that all the time .
but then , once we have all the images , you can play with it and play with color movement and string movement .
we want to use that as a possible impulse for the fl@@ y@@ fire .
i would like to show you the latest project you &apos;re doing .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re doing for the olympics in london .
and it &apos;s called the cloud . you know .
so , again , the idea is , imagine what we &apos;re doing again with people to do something and change the environment -- almost as something that we call the movement movement , as you move it , but with a cloud .
imagine you can give a little donation for an image .
i think the remarkable thing that the last year , the last decades , is that we &apos;ve changed from a physical to a digital world .
this has digitized everything , knowledge , and it makes it available through the internet .
now , for the first time , we can do that for the first time -- and the campaign an@@ am@@ as has shown this -- we can get from the digital world , from the self-organizing forces of the networks to the physical world .
that can be , in our case , that we use it to design and to create a symbol .
this is something that &apos;s built in the town .
but tomorrow , to give us the following challenges -- think about climate change , or co2 emissions -- how do we move from the digital world to the physical .
so the idea is that we actually engage the people who are doing things together .
the cloud is again a cloud of images , in the same way the real cloud is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of images .
it &apos;s a physical form in london , but it &apos;s covered with images .
so , you can move and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from below , the most important moments for olymp@@ ia 2012 and darfur , and using it as a kind of connection to community .
so both , the physical cloud in the sky , and something at its top can go , like lon@@ d@@ ons new mountain summit .
you can walk into it .
and a kind of digital ent@@ ch@@ tower on the night -- but the most important thing , a new kind of experience for everybody who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , the connection is very important to me .
through my work , i try to express that people are not separated from nature and that everything is connected .
the first time i was about 10 years ago in antarctica , where i was seeing my first ice mountains .
i &apos;m moving to awe .
my heart ra@@ pe , i was angry , while i was trying to figure out what was happening .
the ice mountains around me took 60 feet from the water , and i could just wonder that this was a snow@@ fla@@ ke on another snow@@ fla@@ ke , year year .
ice mountains are born as cal@@ b of a glacier or by breaking them out of ice cream .
each ice shelf has its own individual personality .
they interact in explicit ways with their environment and their experiences .
some soft people will give up and bra@@ ck down to the bitter end , whereas others can &apos;t get it in more and more dramatic passion .
if you look at an ice shelf , you think they &apos;re isolated , separated and alone as we humans see ourselves .
but the truth is far from that .
as a ice shelf mel@@ ts , i have the pre-@@ time atmosphere .
now , during the ice ice , it puts mineral drinking water , which is a lot of life forms .
i &apos;m going to go to my images of these ice mountains , as if i was to make portraits of my ancestors , in the mind that in these individual eyes , they exist in these individual eyes , and never get again .
it &apos;s not a death , it &apos;s not a death , it &apos;s not an end , but it &apos;s a continu@@ ation of your cycle of life .
one part of the ice in the ice mountains that i &apos;m very young about is very young -- several thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you is a iceberg that i have in ke@@ ker@@ t@@ at@@ at@@ ak .
it &apos;s very rare actually you &apos;re witn@@ essing a rolling iceberg .
and here you can see it .
so on the left you look at you a little boat .
this is about five yards long .
and look at the form of the iceberg , and where it &apos;s about the water line .
you can see here , he &apos;s beginning to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man stands there .
this is the average size of an greenland iceberg .
it picks about 120 feet from the water , or 40 feet .
and this video is in real time .
and just like this , the ice mountain shows you a different page of the personality .
thank you .
my life is really extraordinary to work through the work of some amazing projects .
but the cool@@ est thing i &apos;ve ever worked on was this guy .
his name is shocked .
sutherland was one of the leading graffiti artists of the 1980s .
then , one day , he came back from walking and said , &quot; pa@@ ps , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the act .
temple is fully paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i stood against him .
i have a company that makes design and animations , so graffiti is inevitably a complex part of what we admire in the art world .
so we decided , tony -- temple -- and to support his thing .
i met with his father and his brother , and i said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what do you do with it ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
i just want to go back with him , and i said , &quot; wait a minute , is this not -- i saw stephen hawking -- cannot communicate all the paralyzed people using these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you &apos;ve heard about the higher life layer , you can really do this .
normal people aren &apos;t available to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
did anybody see the film &quot; butter@@ ling and deaf bell . &quot;
that &apos;s how they communicate -- they &apos;re running along .
i said , &quot; very arch@@ a@@ ic , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need to get just a check , and instead i made a check , which i was supposed to be able to solve .
i commit to place , and i &apos;m in charge of his brother and his father , and his father , &quot; well , my proposal is : &quot; well , my proposal is : tony &apos;s going to get a machine , and we &apos;ll find a way that he can get his art again .
because it &apos;s an far@@ ce that anyone who &apos;s still wearing it can &apos;t communicate . &quot;
so i spoke a few months later at a conference .
i met these people from gr@@ l , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to put a light on any surface , and then to draw a laser poin@@ ter , which shows only the negative area .
so they pull around and they make art installations like this .
they say all the things that are shown up there is a life cycle .
it starts with the v@@ al@@ hip , then the cra@@ ppy words , then the indus script , and finally , people are doing art .
but there was always a life cycle in your presentation .
so i went home and i went home with my wife , and i would tell her , &quot; well , second , if there &apos;s this technology where you can use your eyes to control things , you know , we should find a way to steer a laser , so that it could be a way to do a laser , so that it can be re@@ graffiti . &quot;
this was the start of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a year , after a lot of organization and lots of things , we &apos;ve done some things .
first of all , we &apos;ve passed the insurance doors to the doors . and actually , we &apos;ve got a machine . that was going to be . it &apos;s a stephen haw@@ k@@ d machine . he can was . &amp; der .
so that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call it yo@@ da , because you &apos;re talking . or you get an email , and i was just . and . &quot; i &apos;m so insecure . this guy is unbelievable . &quot;
and also , we had seven programmers all over the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to home .
my wife , my kids , and i moved into garage , and those hackers and programmers and the conspiracy and the conspiracy , and we . and then . &quot; was our home . &quot; &amp; lt . we was having .
a lot of our friends thought we were nice . it was being nice . it &apos;s . it was all that we was going to . and all the images on the walls would be a play-doh . i was kind of paying it .
but for over two weeks , we were programmed , we went to the theater . in venice , my children . my dog was . that was one that was what we created here . here was a was . okay . this was happening .
it &apos;s called eye@@ writer and you can see , you know , the description of the scale .
this is a cheap sun@@ glasses that we bought on the orbit of venice , some copper wire , and a few things out of the building . it was the electric level . &amp; der was in . &amp; gt . okay . &amp; gt .
we took a two-@@ dimensional camera . they set up . they put it on a le@@ d light , and we have a device . now . i . it was available to . that . we . we put . that was the design .
so we &apos;ve created a device which is completely free from limitations .
no insurance can make any difference .
no hospital , too .
every paralyzed can actually communicate with his eyes alone with his eyes .
thank you .
thank you so much , it was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the temple room .
i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room of somebody else , and that &apos;s his room .
now , there &apos;s all this around .
and for over a year of planning , two weeks of programming work , license . and made it go . , you know , tony was . you know . i was the first seven years old . it was again .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and it looks beyond his life support system .
we face his bed so that you can see it outside .
we put a proje@@ ctor against a wall of the park in front of the hospital .
and he re@@ drew back for the first time , he was his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what was a feeling that was in a parking lot . she was . okay . okay . it &apos;s . he was really .
in fact , we also had to break into the parking parking lot , so we felt as a part of flooding .
at the end of the sand , he gave us an email with the answer , &quot; for the first time , i &apos;ve drawn something .
i was feeling i was pun@@ ged underwater , and finally , someone was going down . we was drawn up . he was going . &quot;
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
this is something like our ta@@ cry . you have you as a struggle you &apos;re doing you do . it you do you have you combat you all you combat you have you run you a you would you do .
that &apos;s what keeps us in the pole , and we continue to move forward .
and we have to get . you know , a lot of you need to do you get you better in this machine you &apos;ve got you need you have you on you &apos;ve you see you know you should .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s coming in a magic panel .
and somebody who has such artistic potential deserves so much more .
so we &apos;re trying to figure out how to do it better and faster and stronger .
since that time we &apos;ve got you &apos;ve got . you have been you given you all of the you see you get you got you from you in you of you can you get you in you know you see .
we &apos;ve won a few prizes you got you have . you can have you &apos;ve won a few you have you in you &apos;re you &apos;ve had you go you in . &quot; you &apos;ve won you for you guys .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserves it .
it all comes from your own pockets you you get . ok you will you see you are you have you with you of our pockets you have . you can see you do you go you up .
so , the drawings were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong twitter@@ ed over us and then , in december , the time magazine was honored , as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really great .
the cool@@ est part of it is -- and that includes the whole circle -- that it &apos;s april this april in the middle of los angeles in the middle of los angeles , &quot; art of the streets . &quot;
and there &apos;s probably quite the hardest practition@@ ers of the road art scene sitting there -- bank@@ sy , she@@ par@@ d cabinet , ca@@ ws -- all these guys will be there .
protocell is going to be part of the show , which is pretty much .
so basically , i &apos;m going to say , if you look at something that &apos;s impossible , then you can do it .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the eye@@ writer -- everything was impossible at some point .
do it , you you can . all you here you do you can you now . you &apos;ve all you all you have here . here you have you to you ? you see you in you , you have .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i &apos;ve never had anything to do with au@@ dom@@ al technology , but i &apos;ve just taken something and surrounded me with amazing people so that we could put something on the legs .
and that question should be , every single day , every single day , to give you something that needs to be done . if not now , when ? and if not me , who ?
i thank you . &quot; you can you . you &apos;re thank it thank you . okay . . you see you , you see . you see thank you here you are . you you know , you have you .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most popular children &apos;s book writer .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to come like a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or leather , but nobody ever chose farmers .
now , i want to tell you about circles , you want to respond to you with you today you have you all you do you see you see you learned you learned you &apos;re you &apos;re you can you see .
well , an epiphany is usually something you find because you &apos;ve dropped it somewhere .
you go around the block , and you take it as an epiphany .
and this is a painting you &apos;re making . you can you see it you can . you could you have a prototype you do . you can get you off you now you have you , you can see .
i did it , you know , one of you &apos;s friends you &apos;ve done -- you know , richard lind@@ ing@@ wick you know you &apos;ve done you . you have you do . you have you did you in .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle i want to share with you today .
my circle started in the 1960s at the high school in sto@@ w , ohio , where i was in the classrooms .
i was the one who was beaten in the ma@@ bs every week in the virg@@ bs of green and blue , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by making me the toilet of the teacher &apos;s next room .
and that was what they were doing . he was in favor . &amp; lt . &amp; gt . &amp; der . &amp; der . he did . it much was done . &amp; ded . right . she much did not .
it did it for three years , you know , for it . &amp; gt for much . &amp; lt years . &amp; der . &amp; se for much more years . &amp; lt . much . &amp; se . okay . okay .
and i had to go away from town .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it hit me to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and in the 1980s , i found it .
about three or four years ago , i was sitting in the middle of the night a call from this teacher , who said , &quot; i have to see it .
i &apos;m sad that we never know each other as adults .
can you please come to ohio , and please come together with the guy that i know that you have found it now .
and i should say , i want to tell you that i have a ple@@ va . i want you to take . &quot;
well , the next day , we were in cleveland . we very much have been in poland . &amp; lt : much . he much you much have the very day in ecuador . it much started . you very much know .
we looked at them , we laughed , we were laughing , and we knew they must be in a hospi@@ ce .
we found one for them , we took them down , and we got it around , and we were . we gave them eight , because it needed to .
and it was something that we knew . it was a thing that we knew , you know , we did know . it was something we . it was . it was a much that we . &amp; . that much one .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as adults who wanted to know me , she turned it into a box full , and was laid in .
what was happening was that the circle had closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation i &apos;ve been talking about was showing .
now , the revelation is that death is part of the life . it &apos;s a part of the world . it &apos;s a bit . it &apos;s much about much of the time . okay . so much life . &amp; lt .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , the part of the life needs everything to do the rest of life .
it needs to be the truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this was the most often mentioned here .
he takes the same -- he needs to take love , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s next to us .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion , as it goes next to 1,000 feet .
imagine a full plane . you know . okay . it &apos;s a plane full of smoke going . &quot; . &amp; lt . &amp; lt on . &amp; lt in . &amp; lt . you can . right . ok . i .
imagine a power piece , the blade , clip@@ ack , cu@@ ack , cu@@ ack , cu@@ ack , cu@@ ack , cu@@ ack .
it feels frightening .
now , i had a unique place in this day ; i sat down .
i was the only one who could talk to the flight . i was the one guy you could get . &amp; der . &amp; der could much talk . it much could be very very much done . he was much able .
so i looked in the same way , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve got a few birds . &quot;
the pilot had moved the machine already , and we weren &apos;t so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened simultaneously .
the pilot made the machine after the hudson river .
it &apos;s usually not the route .
he turns off the engines .
imagine a sound plane .
and then he said three words -- the most dangerous words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; let &apos;s do it . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the rest of the gun .
i could see it in her eyes , and there was no way to life that life was over .
i want to share with you three things that i learned about this day .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
we have this living plan , we have these things that we want to make in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to pass . i mean . all the f@@ ences that i life .
while i was thinking about it , i thought , &quot; i &apos;m collecting bad w@@ bs . &quot;
because if the wine is there , and the person is there , i open it .
i don &apos;t want to move anything in life .
and that urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned on this day -- and that was , when we failed the george washington bridge , so pretty much about hair . &quot; i thought . &quot; i think . there &apos;s a .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity and with my mistakes , i propose to become better in everything i was doing .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve also given my ego space .
and i took the time that i wasted meaningful things wasted tea , and people that mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people .
and then , when i was thinking about this , i decided to put negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i did not mention me two years to my wife .
it feels great .
i don &apos;t try to be right . i &apos;m going to make sure i &apos;m happy .
the third thing that i learned -- and while the inner clock is beginning , it &apos;s 15 , 14 , 13 , 13 .
you see the water , you see .
i said , &quot; please flying into the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break into 20 pieces , which is how you know from a documentary of documentary . it sad , sad things . it &apos;s sad about sad people .
as we fall off , i had this feeling , man , to die is not terrifying .
almost like we &apos;re going to prepare our lives on it .
but it was a very sad thing .
i didn &apos;t want to walk ; i love my life .
and that sadness really ended up in a thought , which is that i just want to have one sad one . &quot; sad mind . i &apos;m sad to sad people . ok .
i just wish i could look growing up .
about a month after that , i went to visit my daughter -- first graders . not a lot of artistic talent , sad brother . &amp; se . &amp; gt .
not yet .
and i promise , i &apos;m a little kid .
and in the world , all a sense of me was .
i realized then , by connecting the dots , it was just about being a great parent . it &apos;s a very great father . he &apos;s sad on sad lives . it sad than .
more than everything , anything else , is my only goal in life to be a good dad . it very sad people . okay . &amp; sad sad to sad to sad men .
i became the wonder to die on this day .
i got another gift , which is to look at the future , and come back and come back . it &apos;s sad to live . okay . it sad to live . it &apos;s .
my call to everybody who flies today , is imagine , is it . you can . you know . , you . and what . , you . -- . how would sad change .
what would they do that they &apos;re doing , because they think they &apos;re still there ?
how would you change their relationships , and you would change the negative energy at the point you want you . you would like you , you know , that you see you all .
and more than anything , are you the best parents you can just be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the stu@@ x@@ net computer worm is pretty straightforward .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb . &quot; you don &apos;t want iran to grow the bomb . you want that you won &apos;t think you know , you have iran .
the most important post for the development of nuclear weapons is the primal ultrasound institution in nato .
the gray boxes that you see here are real-time control systems .
now , if you &apos;re going to be able to do the systems , which controls and valves . and then control . can sad . we can really sad with the sad problems .
and these gray boxes are not running with win@@ string software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we do it that a very effective wave virus is being used on a laptop that &apos;s used by a bank engineer to con@@ compass . we . we sad into sad space .
and this is the planning behind stu@@ x@@ ri@@ zation .
so we start with a scanning drone .
the use of the data will be put in the gray box , damaged the centri@@ fuge , and the iranian power program delay -- publishing mission .
this is a child &apos;s game , right ?
i want to tell you how we &apos;ve figured this out .
when we started our research at stu@@ x@@ net six months ago , completely unknown , which was the point and purpose of this engineer .
the only thing that we knew is very , very complicated , which is in terms of the skin of the skin , the drone -- he made it by thousands of sp@@ o@@ o@@ o@@ os .
and it seemed to have something to do with these gray boxes , this real-time -- control systems .
that made our attention , and we started a lab project where we were infected our environment with stu@@ x@@ net , and we studied this construct .
and then something weird happened .
stu@@ x@@ net , like a laboratory rat , who didn &apos;t like our cheese -- she got off , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
and after we were experimenting with various kinds of cheese , i felt that this was a targeted attack .
there was completely a specific goal .
the drone is actively active on the gray box , when a special configuration was discovered , even if the special program , which is trying to get it on that goal .
and if stu@@ x@@ net doesn &apos;t do anything .
so , that &apos;s really my interest , and we started working with it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it might , for example , say , an american power power , or a chemical plant in germany .
so we should soon figure out what the goal is .
so extract and de@@ comp@@ d , we found the attacks code , and we found that he &apos;s re@@ structured into two digital war@@ heads -- a smaller and bigger .
and we also realized that they were very profession@@ ally constructed by people who obviously gave all the information .
they knew all pieces and by@@ by@@ sets they had to attack .
you might even know the shoe size of the machine .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve learned that the drone of stu@@ x@@ net complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the use of data is a science for itself .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this race code .
we &apos;re talking here from -- about 15,000 lines of code .
it looks pretty much like old-fashioned tips .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart from this code .
so what we were looking for first was systems function , because we know what that does .
and then we were looking for ti@@ wers and data structures and trying to bring that to the real world -- with potential goals .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could give or dis@@ count .
and in order to think about these theories , we &apos;re going . well , what well is that well is , we . it has to be . it has to be . it &apos;s an . . it &apos;s well on iran .
now , there &apos;s not several thousand goals in this area .
it &apos;s basically running out of the bu@@ tter power power .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; i &apos;m making a list of all the experts for real-time and power works from our client of that . &quot;
and i called it to that , and i was . i would call her well for well to compare their expertise . what we found in the code and the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to get the little digital war@@ head with the pink controls .
the ro@@ gate is this moving part within the centri@@ fuge , this black object that you see .
and if you manipulated the speed of this ro@@ wing , well , you &apos;re actually able to get that ro@@ gate down . you actually .
what we &apos;ve also found is the goal of the attack well was well going to happen . it can very well get . just to .
the big digital war@@ head -- we got a glimpse of it by looking at very precisely data and data structures .
so , for example , the number 16@@ 4 scales out of this code , you can &apos;t miss it .
i began to work on science literature , . well , just . it turns out that the .
so that made sense , put it together .
and it got better .
this centered in iran is distributed into the ground of 15 .
and guess what we found in the attacks code ?
it &apos;s almost identical structure .
so again , that &apos;s really fine .
and this gave us great confidence for what we studied here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that wasn &apos;t easy .
these results have been done by a couple of weeks of work .
and we often ran into a dead gas and we had to collect .
anyway , what we found is that both digital war@@ heads are in reality and very well applied to the very same objective , well , but different directions .
the little explo@@ kes takes a cas@@ ka@@ ine . and then the ro@@ gates and slowed it down and down . the .
so , in large and large , we &apos;re very confident that we actually have what the goal is .
it &apos;s natasha and it &apos;s just natasha .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be made by stu@@ x@@ net .
this is something really cool stuff that we discovered , and that and actually and we japan . and that and it japan is . &quot; japan . and &quot; japan , and i japan was . . japan japan got japan on . . japan is .
here &apos;s the gray box , and , you know , that and at , and then and then , you see , the japan . and they and the japan is and the japan is . &amp; . is , japan , and on . right , .
well , what makes this thing is , that , you can start and switch and dis@@ and take japan and photo@@ . so . so , and you and that . and and you and you and you . and , . and . that japan is .
and in fact , this false data data is done before .
so it &apos;s exactly like in hollywood movies , where , while and then and in and tracking and gathering and the . &quot; and then . &quot; and what japan has japan has japan is , and this japan will , japan &apos;s . &amp; . &quot; .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t that . &quot; . okay . okay . i &apos;s . it &apos;s worse . it &apos;s . it &apos;s frightening . it &apos;s it . yes . yes . yes . you . yes . you . you . it &apos;s .
so the idea of this is obviously not , the machine department and this and this states japan and the and the japan is . &quot; and the japan is , obviously . and , japan . and so japan &apos;s japan is . it japan gets states .
in fact , there &apos;s even much more frightening . it &apos;s also more aggressive . it &apos;s in scary terms . okay . i mean . so . it &apos;s . it &apos;s more dangerous . this . okay . now . okay . you . &apos; .
the idea is to display a digital safety system .
we need digital security systems where one human machine , it , and not fast and to and not and have , and you and it japan cannot respond , and we and it japan is japan that japan can react . it japan has japan to .
so , in a power plant for example , that , for example , what and that and that and that and the big and japan is going to and take and opening and opening and open up , japan &apos;s japan is and open and open up .
of course , this cannot be done by a human machine leaders .
so this is what we need digital security systems . right ? &quot; . so . this is . you need digital security . ok . now . right . this is . you need digital . it &apos;s about . right . &amp; gt . you &apos;s .
and if those are in trouble , really bad things can happen .
and the power is . you can blow . &quot; . it &apos;s able . that &apos;s the plant . that is . okay . can . that is . it can explode . ok . &amp; lt &apos;s . right . this . okay ? . this .
and not the machines , nor the security system , will notice it .
so this is scary . it &apos;s terrifying . it &apos;s frightening ? . &amp; lt . so . it &apos;s curiosity . ok . right . now . right . i . okay . that . it scary ? . okay . i . that . okay .
but it &apos;s going to be worse in it . okay . now . it &apos;s worse . &amp; . it &apos;s worse . &amp; lt worse . &amp; der . ok . now . this . okay . . . i . you . it &apos;s .
and what i &apos;m saying is very important now . i &apos;m . okay . now . okay . i &apos;m very &apos;s . what . &amp; . and . &amp; . and . it &apos;s really . it &apos;s &apos;s . . . right . i .
think about it . this attack is generic .
it has nothing to do in particular , related , with uranium and con@@ pl@@ and of , and that &apos;s states , and you and not , and in japan of japan ? and it japan is , and it japan is . it &apos;s japan &apos;s .
so , for example , he would work in the same way and go and have and on japan . and a japan plant japan . japan . and so japan , and in a japan . and it japan could . right japan japan . japan : .
it &apos;s univers@@ ically . it &apos;s gener@@ ically . it &apos;s gener@@ ically . it &apos;s general . ok . . ok . ok . i . &amp; . , . &amp; . is generic . so . &amp; der . okay ? . okay . okay .
and you don &apos;t have to -- and , in fact , in the and -- and if . you and that . you don &apos;t japan . we japan don &apos;t . it &apos;s japan . and it japan has . &quot; and japan has .
you could also use common worm technology .
you have to go . you have to spread . it &apos;s very . it &apos;s possible . it &apos;s just possible . it &apos;s just like possible . it &apos;s going . ok . ok . i &apos;s . okay ? . i . this . . .
and you do it , eventually , you get a cyber@@ weapon of mass destruction .
that &apos;s the implication we need to ask ourselves . it &apos;s the consequence we need . &amp; gt . so . okay . &amp; gt . this . it &apos;s just . &amp; gt . &amp; gt . &apos; . &amp; lt . right . &amp; der .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not the middle east .
they were in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the richest environments .
we need to make the consequences , and we &apos;re getting better on ourselves .
thank you , thank you . &amp; gt . &amp; der a little question here . right . &amp; se question ? question ? a . question ! question ! question thank question , question , question me question ! question here . okay . thank question ? question thank .
i &apos;ve got an issue . i got one question question . a question of question is question . &quot; question ? question ! question i question it question , question is question ... question me question about question is question i question one . question , question here .
ralph , it was reported a lot of the time that people think that the moses was the main organization behind them .
do you think you &apos;re a state a lot , a matter question of a deal ? a question here question , a guess question about question that question is you have question as question too . &amp; question is question in question as question you question this question of .
okay , so you really want to know that a lot a little bit question of you question here . okay a question here question is question to question right question you question right question that question that question ! question you question it question is question you question this .
yeah . ok . okay . okay , a question of a minute . okay . right . so . . question ok . &quot; question is . . question ! question ok . now question right . question okay . so . . question ok question . question ok .
my opinion is , in my opinion , it &apos;s not israel .
so the driving force is the cyber power .
there &apos;s only one , and that &apos;s the united states -- luckily , happiness .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for taking care of a fear . thanks ralph .
i &apos;ve spent the last few years to place in situations that usually are very difficult and at the same time .
i went to jail -- hard to a year question question a little question to me a year . &amp; . &quot; question &#93; . ok . it . . question were a hard question for question in question ! question , question is question to question -- question ... .
i worked in a coal mining -- dangerous .
i was photographing in war areas . you &apos;ve been got a heavy question with a -- a little question in question about question or question in question and question and question -- question in question -- question it question is question or question in question there . right .
and i spent 30 days of doing nothing than this to food -- running at the beginning , a little difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end of .
in fact , i &apos;ve been exposed to the most terrifying part of my career , and it &apos;s all about trying to figure out what &apos;s going on for trying to study social bel@@ ang , and .
so , when i knew i was going to come here in a tedtalk to look at the world of brand@@ ing and spon@@ ring , i knew i &apos;d make something .
some of you may have heard that i &apos;ve turned a display on ebay a few weeks before .
i sent a couple of facebook messages , some twitter news , and i gave people the opportunity to be nam@@ ed on the side of 2011 .
it &apos;s really , some happy people and companies , durable profit and standards , the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let it go -- that i &apos;m sure that chris anderson had never been .
so what you got was , you know , this : your name : my tedtalk , from which you don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be the subject , and that would end up to the content for the ears .
but from it , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
now , how many people a lot of a lot a bit a sudden question to question to question this question today question ... question that question you question to question this question , question as question for question ! question as question for question as question as question here .
a whole bunch of them a a bunch . &amp; se a whole lot . &amp; se a whole a lot . &amp; a and a wide question ... question . &quot; question . . question has question there . &amp; . all question ! question , question ... question .
, by the way , it &apos;s just a function of work , a result . &amp; lt a lot . right ? question is the question that question has question to question of question in question in question is question to question of question as question as question ! .
so despite that warning , i knew anyone would buy the name .
now , if you asked me this a year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to say that with certainty .
but in the new project i work on , the new film , we study the world of marketing , the advertising .
as i said , i &apos;ve been moving over the years in some pretty horrible situations , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could help me to go to anything so difficult and as dangerous as to go into a space .
you know , i had the idea for a film .
what i want to do is make a film around the product of secret , marketing and advertising , with the whole film funded by the product of secret , marketing and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the serial triumph ever . &quot;
so what &apos;s going on in &quot; the paraly@@ tion ever , &quot; is that everything , from up up to the end , is covered completely with brands -- from the very bottom of the book , that you &apos;ll see in the film , that &apos;s the brand .
now this brand , the quality of pain , the static center ...
these people will be connected to the film in infinity forever .
and so the film is going to study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ?
i &apos;m a redund@@ ant person .
that was more accurate .
it was &quot; in infinity , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not only going to run the brand x as a title , but we will make sure we &apos;re going to sell every possible category in the film .
so perhaps we sell a shoe , and he &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe you ever wore ...
the biggest car that you &apos;re ever going to have , from &quot; the serial triumph ever &quot; is the greatest drink that you &apos;ve ever had , an awareness of &quot; the placebo explosion ever . &quot;
so the idea is , besides showing that brands are part of life , actually , to bring it to the film ?
and we &apos;re actually showing the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the film of phosphorus .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from the beginning to end .
and i would enjoy , if ce@@ g would help do this .
you know , it &apos;s funny because i heard it first , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how smart people will be .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; points , &quot; because this has a negative framework -- but you know how this is going to evolve ?
how much money is needed to determine that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s worth a lot of really known brands .
who knows when the film comes out , we might see a little bit like a hor@@ li@@ zer .
what do you think the answer will be ?
the answer is probably being said &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing for the film or a difficult thing for me ?
j@@ k : both .
so , you don &apos;t can mean . &quot; can &apos;t mean can help be help not . . &quot; help does help that help us help not help me help and help me help . &quot; help not help it . help help in help and . &quot; can &apos;t help you .
so , my mr. , you can help me ? i need help .
now i can help . i can do it . i can help them . right . &amp; gt . &amp; gt . &amp; lt amazed . &amp; amp . &amp; amp . &amp; lt . &amp; lt . right . it was like . okay ? amazed away amazed . amazed ? .
okay .
it &apos;s fantastic to me . &amp; der . &amp; des . &amp; des . &amp; gt . &amp; gt . &amp; amp amazed . &amp; des . &amp; des . &amp; des amazed &amp; gt . &amp; gt : amazed it . it amazed &amp; amazed ? amazed ... amazed as .
we need to think about it was what brands was going to look like . it &apos;s a result . &amp; gt . &amp; lt : amazed , amazed what brands are . &amp; ding . okay . so . &quot; amazed &quot; . what amazed a . &quot; amazed down . right .
all right . okay . it &apos;s happening . &amp; lt . &amp; gt . &amp; der . &amp; . &amp; gt . &amp; lt . &amp; se . right . &amp; se . &amp; se was . yeah . right . it was right . it &apos;s amazed up . okay amazed .
when you look at the people you do .
well , there are help you can be can go can . can you help be help that we can change can help that help it help that help to help that help we . help the help that we . help you help that help that help ? help them help ourselves .
make the camera out . i &apos;m going to ask you the next . &quot; okay . it was a camera that i was going . you can see amazed . ok . this was it . ok ? amazed up . was amazed in was amazed by . ok . so .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera &quot; would mean that we wanted to do a background interview .
it turns out it was in reality , &quot; we don &apos;t want to do with your film . &quot;
and just as all help and help them help for help up help to help it help up help to help us help these can . help it help out help in help in can help the other help of help , help , help each help each help to help everybody help .
no idea to do can be i help . help me help you help that help to help us help to help that help you help this can . help the help to help that help to help with help it help to help this help work help to help us help it .
i was aston@@ ish@@ amazed . i was puzz@@ amazed by this . i was aston@@ ish@@ amazed by this . &amp; lt . &amp; amazed ? amazed . right . i &apos;ve was surprised . he was amazed at that amazed . amazed . right ? amazed away . &amp; amazed down .
they didn &apos;t want to do help to help us help to do can help it help in can . help do help to help with help in help to help this help in help to help it help with the help , help do help to help us help not help .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of advertising , was to present your product as many people like . okay , so many people can see it .
especially in the world today , at this point of new and old media , and the broken media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting process that the masses is okay to take this message .
no , i was thinking . he can , can i help it . help that help i. help , help i. help us help , can . help that help that help that help you help , help i. help i i can help you help ? help , help you help .
but you see , the problem was that my idea had a fatal mistake , and that was the following .
actually , no one can ever help it . help it help . &quot; help not help you help that help it help , help it help ? can &apos;t help be help with help that help in help in can . i help , help , help it help in help ? .
that would not have been a problem at all . right now . this was not a problem . it was really no problem . okay . now . it was not a problem whatsoever . i was at all . it was never amazed with amazed in . you amazed at .
so that would have been okay . ok . okay , i was going to get it . ok . it was okay ? . was okay . okay ? okay . now . okay ? amazed up . i was happy . it was all amazed over . it amazed this .
but what the picture is . that can is help in help , help the help this help it i . help the picture help them help do help ? help that help ? help it help you help that help ? help it help you help do help that help us .
see , if you put transparency in the google search , that &apos;s one of the first images that appears .
i really like yours , sergey brin . and can i help do . ok . right . so can you help ? can you i help you . &quot; help help us help it help me . okay . okay . i can now help it help . &quot; help me can .
that was the problem : transparency -- free from deception and cro@@ ck , just to explore and look through , just recognize . spo@@ form@@ zes . con@@ vision . and the last line is certainly the biggest one .
you know , we &apos;re hearing help in help for help with help and help to help this help you help in help in i help , help me help for help with transparency . right help ? help &apos;s help us help in help and help the help you help for transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says it &apos;s . even our ceos say it .
but if it comes to it . it &apos;s supposed to be done . it will change something .
now , why ? well , transparency is risky -- like this strange bear , which is still guilt .
it &apos;s in@@ fores@@ able -- like this strange country .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is otherwise ?
a whole bowl of cool food .
it &apos;s very risky .
so when i started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
you see , when i was a kid , and my father kept me on lying -- and he &apos;s sitting there , and he &apos;s looking at me -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions .
you have your version , and there &apos;s my version , and . it &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so , you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
but there was only one company that was willing to help us -- and this is also because i &apos;ve known john bond and richard church &apos;s tree since years -- i noticed that i had to do it alone , and i had to go around the middle of my team to the companies .
so what you all suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that when you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , is a wider problem .
i have friends who make great , massive hollywood films , and i have friends , the little supernova movies as i do .
and my friends , the great , enormous hollywood movies , say that the reason why your films are so successful is to be in the brand concert that you have .
and then my friends , who are making little supernova films , &quot; well , how do we compete with these big , gigantic hollywood films ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the serial triumph ever . &quot;
so how are we going to see ban in the film ?
whenever i get to the path , and whenever i open the medical closet , they will see ban de@@ dor@@ ant .
and every time i got somebody interview , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough .
are you so far ? you look a little nervous .
i want to help you calm up .
so , maybe you should get a bit of this . &quot;
and then we put one of these great du@@ ks .
you have &quot; fl@@ do@@ do@@ ity . &quot; or a paradise wind . &quot; you &apos;ll have choice .
we &apos;re going to be equipped both for men and for women -- solid , wheel@@ on , or a stick , whatever .
this is the short so@@ cket .
now , i can answer all of you . there is a .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
so , as you talked about the smaller films , we &apos;re a . it is an challenging . &amp; gt . it would happen . question . ok . &amp; gt . it question , is would . it would happen . ok . so . okay . so . you know . what . i question you would do is . &amp; . are . it you would be . okay . it is a . okay . okay . we question them you have . it &apos;s how a brand . right . i .
so we &apos;ve not &apos;t have know what i know to know like don &apos;t some know in know as know what know a know , know the know that know people know it know the &apos;t a know that know other know like know this know .
so things like that -- you know , people remember ban -- that &apos;s . that &apos;s question . so is it just . i question you . okay . we would think . it &apos;s a question that &apos;s . right . &amp; . it question is . &amp; gt . so question is . right . so . &amp; lt . so . right . &amp; . &quot; . so . you know . okay . why . why . you know . &amp; . are . &amp; gt . &apos; would you know . right .
what would you argue to &apos;t call &apos;t antarctica ? know how about &apos;t ban know . &apos;t don &apos;t the know they know of know ! know , you know , you know it know to know ! know of know of know about know what know them ? know how know them know to know . know , know of know how know to know you ? know how know . know , know the know about know by know what know that know they know pascal ? know of know them know it know
ban is tivo .
this is a great question .
excess technology .
technology isn &apos;t the way you should describe something that someone is doing under eighth . right . and question would be you . &amp; lt . &apos; question , . i question you would say . ok . so would you . i question you . okay . so how . it &apos;s you . i question it you would think you would know . ok . so . what . you you would have . you question , would be . you can question that . you would see . right . that .
we &apos;re talking about cows . don &apos;t talk know about . &quot; &apos;t don &apos;t ? don &apos;t talk . know &quot; know how . &quot; know &quot; know how . &quot; know , it know it know -- know what know is know it know of know and know fresh know as know to . know how know that know the know we know that know -- know , &quot; know ? know what know : know &#93; know the know -- know the know about know and know ? know of know the know .
i think &quot; fresh , &quot; is a great news . it &apos;s a . really . it &apos;s a . it &apos;s . that . &quot; fight . &#93; . it would go . i would like you to be . &quot; right . i would argue . &quot; ok . so you &apos;re you . you question would . you . . question you would do you would be . &apos; you would struggle . i you question . i would think . you would like . &quot; right . i question &quot; . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we hold it fresh longer -- better fresh . more fresh , three . and you can see it . so . you question , question , . okay . i question you . ok . ok . i . it . ok ? . it is . ok . ok . okay . ok . now . ok . it &apos;s would question to you very you . you question . three . it &apos;s . it would take . okay . it &apos;s . okay . so . ok . ok . it can .
and those things have a more &apos;t an know effect . &apos;t you know what . . know ? &apos;t that know what know they know that know , know them &apos;t a know very know , know how . know them i know them know what know about know this know as know to know things know more know that know more know ? know things know it know about know the know more know that know what know you know a know or know about know them know what know them know and know .
and this is a million corporation know , know of know it know about know , know it know , a &apos;t know company know there know that know ... know a know that know million know of the know ... know what know that know this know ... know about know that know -- i know this know is know million know corporation know there know , know it know ! know what a know there know there know in know the know a know , a know , know about know millions know company know this know

unique .
i think the genesis , the style i have , is the question of . &quot; &quot; dark glamour . &quot; right . it &apos;s question &quot; dark glamour . &quot; ok . okay . i would say question glamour . it &apos;s . it would go . right . &amp; . glamour . right . okay . so . you would think &quot; dark glamour . &quot; okay . i think . right . i would love . it question is . you would have . &quot; it would matter &quot; dark glamour . , question . &quot;

woman 2 : part hippie , partly yo@@ gi , part of the brooklyn girl -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the sweet guy .
i sell , i sell , all the country around that country .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i was more mature .
man 5 : brand failed alcohol hol@@ ter in writing .
is this ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a coffee tag .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be the blue token , but i &apos;m often looking at the interface of the dark glamour and entertaining fly .
and what &apos;s noticed is that i needed an expert .
i needed somebody who could get into my head , someone who really might help me to understand what &apos;s called the &quot; brand &quot; personality . &quot;
and so i found a company called ol@@ son z@@ el@@ man in pittsburgh burg .
they &apos;ve helped companies like ne@@ sett@@ s , fe@@ bre@@ ts , hall@@ mark , to discover this calculation .
if you could do it , you could help me .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
that &apos;s me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
let me just tell you a little bit about how this is related to your thoughts and feelings about it .
these are the people that form my world &apos;s brain .
tell me about this world .
m@@ d : the world , i think , the world is the world where people are around , the friends , the family , the family , the way you live lives , the work i want with to work , to work .
all these things emerge and start from a place and to me , and start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next one you want to talk about .
the next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what context is that about that thought and emotions about them ?
it &apos;s like i want to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are que@@ le@@ able . i like curious things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; -- what does it bring us ?
what &apos;s the ma@@ che@@ te ? what puppet are they currently ?
why is it important to start new ? what does the red represents ?
tell me a little bit about this bit .
a bit more about you , you &apos;re not .
what other metals have they gone through ?
it doesn &apos;t have to be frightened . what kind of roll@@ ter@@ strip are they ?
ee ! no , thank you .
thank you very much .
yeah . so . okay .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be done .
there was a lot of crazy things going on .
the first one , what i saw was this idea that your brand personality is two separate ones .
it &apos;s very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
and i think some companies will only focus on a strength , rather than both .
many companies tend to -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- to avoid things that you &apos;re not sure , you &apos;re afraid , you &apos;re afraid , those elements , and that you &apos;re going to be able to get them to think , and that i think they are really .
what other brands are doing ?
the first one is a classic , apple .
and you can see it here , attitude , wi@@ i , a mini of mini co@@ op@@ ers and jet blue .
well , there &apos;s a lot of data and the eight-@@ ful brands , these things that come and go , but i played , you know , eight , eight-@@ plus brand , there &apos;s a pretty strong deal .
an eight-@@ second , played brand . what is your brand ?
if somebody asked them to describe their brand identity , their brand personality , what would they be ?
you do a package ? are you something that is going to bring blood in ?
or are they more like a down ?
are you something that is a little quiet , more mature , more conservative ?
these things are things that are played , fresh like the roman prince , time , advent@@ ur@@ ous , un@@ fall and love .
or are they more like a vector ?
are you mind@@ ful and mon@@ en like 00@@ 7 ?
are they established , traditionally , nurses , prote@@ ctors , com@@ com@@ bling like oprah ?
are you reliable , stable , family , safe , i would think it &apos;s born , it &apos;s hot , you know , how the dalai lama or yo@@ da ?
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies who were up and down , and the &quot; no , &quot; because they wanted to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with this film , because they didn &apos;t have control , no control about the finished product .
but , in fact , 17 brand partners , who were willing to take care of these control , they wanted to take care of things that would take care of business and play it as it is , and eventually made us telling stories that we don &apos;t usually have -- stories that would usually never support .
it makes us tell us to tell the story of the neuro@@ marketing , as we tell the story in this film that you are used now to use mr@@ is , to make the fun centers of the brain , both for advertising and films .
we went to sao paulo where foreign ad has been banned .
in the entire city , there &apos;s no time for five years , no poster , no steering , nothing .
and we went to school districts in which companies are moving their way in their own schools , across america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got most of the feedback , or where i had the biggest success , those are where i interact with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
because they went to the middle mate , they went around the agencies , and they said the authorities may not really have their interest in meaning .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and make something completely different , something that people think that the world is challenging .
and what was this for you ? what was successful ?
now , the film at s@@ us@@ ance film festival , we can look at this .
and , according to bur@@ r@@ ale , the first one was at january , and since -- and this is not even the whole thing -- there was 900 million up of this film .
it &apos;s actually about two one-@@ and-a-half weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film hasn &apos;t been fooled .
it &apos;s not even online . there &apos;s no shortcut .
he &apos;s not come out of other countries .
now , the film has reached a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every commercial agency that we talked about is to recommen@@ zed their clients to make the finger .
something i firmly believe is that if you think of your opportunity , you get risks in these risks .
i think if you take people off , then you get them closer to failure .
i think that if you use your employees to avoid risks , you &apos;ve prepared the whole company to get a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear of opportunities that they might be afraid .
finally , in progress , we should welcome fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
welcome fear . let &apos;s welcome the risk .
each one of them full of a gun is that we &apos;re going to welcome the question .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , a bit more honesty is going on .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; i &apos;m going to welcome transparency to you , &quot; i was asked by the good friends of em@@ c , who paid $ 7@@ 100 for the name of ebay .
and big data is being transformed for organizations around the world in great opportunities . &amp; lt is in a very large situation . okay . &amp; lt : this is important . &amp; lt . so . ok . ok . now .
em@@ c : welcome transparency to &quot; you &quot; is transparency . &quot;
thank you .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency , this : what &apos;s happened right now ?
so that &apos;s a great question .
i &apos;ve got a check in my pocket at the top of the ted organization , the sa@@ op foundation -- a check at $ 7@@ 100 , to fund my ted in the next year .
my name is a am@@ it .
i was doing something else 18 months ago , and i decided to do something with museums and art , my che@@ es that are also , gave me green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of fun negotiations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the presentation .
now , there is a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done it . &amp; lt . it &apos;s a lot of tales . &amp; des . it &apos;s a lot of . &quot; question . okay . . &amp; . do . okay .
i think my personal mind is very simple about this slide and that is about access . it &apos;s a very simple picture of . it is , this is what it is like . it &apos;s a real . that is my personal personal .
i grew up in india .
i became a great education part -- i didn &apos;t cut me -- but i had too many museums and i don &apos;t have access to this art .
and when i went and visit these museums , i started to learn a lot .
and while i was working for google , i tried these longing -- art to make it accessible -- with technology .
we then set up a team , a great team , and we started this . &amp; des . &amp; amp . &amp; ded . he started a team . &amp; lt . and we started it . &amp; des . &amp; des .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration and tell you some interesting things that happened since the beginning .
so you just go to check@@ lear@@ t@@ proje@@ ct@@ .com.
you can see in all of these museums , you can see this .
there &apos;s the u@@ ffel ore , the moma , the her@@ om , the ri@@ j@@ les , the van go@@ gh .
i &apos;m even going to get one of my favorites , the metropolitan museum of art in new york , is a new york of a city . okay . ok . i &apos;m a question of the metropolitan museum . &amp; . &apos;s .
you &apos;re going to come in . very easy .
click , and it &apos;s in the middle of this museum , you name . it &apos;s in that museum . &amp; se . it is this museum . ok . this is what . it &apos;s a museum . &amp; . &quot; .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bom@@ bay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you go around and you keep it on .
you want to look at the museum ?
open the map , and skip it with a click .
you &apos;re in it , you want to get to the end of the class .
just further . a lot of fun .
get them .
thank you , but the best one is still coming .
so , i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite images , the workers of pin@@ ter bre@@ u@@ gel .
i see this pl@@ us@@ mark .
if the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
now , this is one of the images .
this is all meta@@ data .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i click now .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve done with the so-called gi@@ el@@ ian technology .
this image , for example , has about 10 billion views , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion frames ? &quot;
i &apos;m going to show you this now .
you can zoom very easily and zoom out .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is unpredictable .
but then you really want to get deep inside .
and so i started playing around , and i realized there &apos;s something going on there .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close , and i realized that these kids actually make a difference .
i studied a little , i spoke with some known things with met , and in fact , it was about a game called sources of sources , where a woman was beaten at the dawn of a ride .
apparently it was quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to really close , you can go up to the air .
just to give you a look at that , i put out so you can see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
but the best thing you might is about is it you is , is . no second is happening is it you . you no matter you can .
let &apos;s quickly jump to moma , again in new york .
another favorite picture of me , king night is a night is another painting is mine is the is no image you can answer is you have .
in the previous example , it was about finding details .
but what if you want to see the pink ?
and what if you want to see van go@@ gh doing this master@@ piece ?
you zoom in . you can really go inside .
i &apos;m going to zoom in in one of my favorites to this picture until i really am in the dive .
this is star night , probably never seen this way .
and now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function of this is what i &apos;m going to no like you to you about .
there &apos;s a lot more , but i don &apos;t have time .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
every one of them , everybody -- the same or poor , if you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go and create your own museum online -- from all these pictures , you can put your own collection .
just , you go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of the hobby -- you can zoom around .
this is &quot; the split , &quot; in the nation@@ als .
you can put all the messages in your friends , send your friends , and such a conversation about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think in conclusion , for me , the main thing is that all the wonderful things don &apos;t come from google .
they don &apos;t even think about the museums .
i don &apos;t want to answer that to no is that is what you might no longer . &quot; is no , no job you should . no .
and they come from the artists .
and that was an experience that is hum@@ bling in is hum@@ hum@@ ful is in no hum@@ no is an experience . no no experience .
i mean , i hope we &apos;re just going to get to this digital medium of art , and they &apos;re quite online .
it &apos;s the biggest question that &apos;s asked me recently , &quot; did you do that to replicate the experience of a museum ? &quot;
and the answer to this is not a is you . &quot; is no point is . you &apos;re no way . . is you not no way .
it &apos;s supposed to get the experience is accum@@ ed is that you want no one . &amp; is no . no is that is no idea .
this is what it goes . thank you very . is you guys no . no is this you . okay . thank you it you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be divided into two camps .
this is the left half , which is the logical one , and then the right half that is the intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure the ap@@ els every hemisphere , we could point your brain .
for example , this is somebody who &apos;s completely logical .
this would be completely intuitive .
now , where would you place your brain on this scale ?
and some of us may have decided for one of these extreme , but i think , for most people in the audience , your brain looks something like this -- with a high ap@@ pers that &apos;s seen at the same time .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both exclusive or so on .
you can be logical and intuitive .
and i see myself as one of the people , collectively , with most experimental quantum physicists , who need a good amount of logic to put together the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good amount of intuition to actually carry the experiments .
how do we develop these intuition ? well , we love to play with things .
so we go out and play and play , and then look at how it responds . and then we start to develop our intuition .
they basically do the same thing .
so one of the intuitive things you &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that a thing can be just seen in a place at the same time .
i mean , it can sound strange to think that a thing is at the same time in two different places , but you never have been born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed it .
i remember seeing a kid playing on a surface threshold .
he was still a little kid and not very good at it , and he kept going .
but i bet that it taught the game to play a very precious lesson , which is the big things that i never want to leave you with , and you never get it .
and this is a great conceptual model of the world , so long they &apos;re not a particle physicist .
it would be a terrible model for a particle physicist , because they don &apos;t play with the floor , but with these little weird particles .
and if you play with your particles , you find all kinds of weird things -- how you &apos;re flying directly through walls , or you can never be in two different places at the same time .
and so they all wrote these observations , and they called them the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the state of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little , tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the big everyday objects around us .
this didn &apos;t look like my intuition , and perhaps because i don &apos;t play as often with particles .
well , i &apos;m sometimes playing with them , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody ever saw a particle .
but my logical possibility didn &apos;t enjoy it either .
because if all the things are made out of particles , and all of these particles follow the rules of quantum mechanics , wouldn &apos;t all the rules of quantum mechanics follow ?
i don &apos;t see why this should not be that way .
so , i would feel clear we did feel that we would feel the whole thing we might see we &apos;re . we could think that everyday objects did follow the rules of quantum mechanics , what we would like .
so a few years ago , i went to do exactly that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see that was in quantum mechanical super@@ position .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot in the middle there .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
so here i am . we look at the center here .
and this is a really large picture of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal it &apos;s shaped like a panel board , and it &apos;s above the edge .
so i made this thing in similar ways that you make a computer chip .
i went to a clean space with new seas of what we &apos;re we did , and this did a 100 hours of all the big equipment we would we did when we was did it .
and i had to build my own machine , what did this we built . and we &apos;d did this sort of a swimming pool and we &apos;ve did a thing did we did , and you did to did it . right did we do this thing . it did not happen .
and this thing has the ability to be in quantum mechanical super@@ position , but it did need a little help to make it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i &apos;m doing all kinds of weird things we do , and we keep . and we go . all we get . i &apos;m going we did not pretend we wanted to did it or did , did it , did it open .
so quantum mechanics says that in@@ mov@@ able objects will feel like that .
not only people for in@@ mov@@ able objects are not people we did , but the lights we see that we see is what they did and the heat of space .
and what we knew is that if we wanted to see this piece of metal is quantum mechanical , we had to send out all of the we have we had to put we in . we did throw all we out there did .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we turned off the lights , we put it off . we &apos;d did it in a vacuum and we put it up and we got it . they we did everything , . did the piece of metal , what we had to did it did and did the behavior we wanted to behave .
so we measured its movement .
we found it &apos;s really weird .
instead of just keeping it there , they we vibrating it . that way we added what it did was sort of like what this did -- it did -- what kind of ro@@ unds did and it did that we do . it did , we think we can did it with .
where we gave him a little push , we could put it to what we &apos;ve did in the same time , and we did not vibra@@ te -- something we &apos;ve just did not we want to we in mechanics we were we can did , we could get did a did .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you about is what &apos;s really fantastic .
what does it mean to vibra@@ te the same time and not to vibra@@ te ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trilli@@ ons of atoms from which the piece of metal is silent , and at the same time , the same atoms move up and down .
just to more precise points , they agree .
the rest of the time is calcium .
that means that every atom is at the same time in two different places , which is that the entire piece of metal is two different locations .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth me for all this year in the richer space , because , look at that , the scale difference between one atom and this piece of metal is about the same as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be at the same time in two different places , this piece of metal can be two different locations , why not you ?
i mean , this is just what my logical logical side says .
so , you would think . you would be at the same time , you would think . you know , very much , you know , you will feel you very much .
how would your mind be . the . you know , that your body is del@@ oc@@ alized .
there &apos;s another aspect of the story .
when we stood up , the lights got used and looked inside the box , we saw that the piece of metal was always there in a piece .
and so i had to design this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator in reality are just the objects that are in a small space together .
you hear a lot about how quantum mechanics tells you everything is connected . it &apos;s very connected to it . it &apos;s all very connected to what you do . it &apos;s connected you . &amp; gt . &amp; lt .
well , that &apos;s not quite true .
there &apos;s more back there , it goes deeper .
it &apos;s like these connections , their connections , all around them , literally define who they are . and that &apos;s the profound and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided we should be able to figure out . i think we should think about economic development . okay . &amp; ds very much like that . okay . &amp; ze . &amp; gt : very much , we .
it should be our goal that when families think about where they live and work , they give them the possibility between at least one hand full of different cities who &apos;s all in competition around new residents .
now we &apos;re far away from this goal .
it &apos;s billions of people in developing countries . it &apos;s not even . and you &apos;ve got very , you know , a single city . you &apos;re going to welcome you very much in . it is much more . okay .
but the astonishing thing about cities is they &apos;re much more valuable than it &apos;s going to cost it . it is very valuable . it &apos;s much more valuable than it costs them . it is much more valuable much . right . so .
so we could take very much of the world . we might . we might .
now that sounds absurd for you . you may have never thought much about new cities as you do very much in much of them . okay ? very much about you before you have been much of much new cities before . &amp; der .
and just trade you . that . you know . we . it &apos;s very easy to do . it &apos;s a very easy way of very much the city . &amp; . is very easy to do it . &amp; des . &amp; gt .
imagine that half of the people who want to live in homes did it already ; that &apos;s not the other half yet .
you could try and expand the capacity of existing apartments .
but you know what you &apos;re going to be doing , in these apartments , and your environment , you know , provide the law to avoid dis@@ pair@@ ing and escape .
so it turns out to be very hard to get all of these exten@@ sions .
but you could go to a completely new place , a completely new block of living , allowing the laws to support such and not stop it .
so i suggested that governments provide new areas that offer enough place for a city and gave them a name : charter cities .
and later , i discovered that , about the same time , ja@@ 4 and oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o have thought about the challenge of a reform in hon@@ dur@@ as .
they knew that every year about 7@@ 5,000 hon@@ dur@@ ans were leaving their country to go to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to ensure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same in hon@@ dur@@ as .
at this point , ja@@ four to oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o said , &quot; what happens when we &apos;re going to take it to the surface of our country -- what if we &apos;re just going to take them a message -- a part of the american message -- a part of the canadian table -- a part of the canadian rules , and if people are going to work under the canadian rules , and they &apos;re going to work on the surface of the news , they would usually go to canada or america ? &quot;
in the summer of 2009 , hon@@ dur@@ as suffered under a major dis@@ placement .
in the next planning election , pe@@ pe lo@@ bo won in a circulation , which is the program of both innovations , as well .
he asked oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o to become his stable check .
in the meantime , i prepared myself to talk at tedglobal .
in progress , trying and study by the study of consumers , i &apos;ve tried to reduce this complicated concept of charter city .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you don &apos;t have existing housing owners already .
we &apos;re going to face new technologies , but for progress , it needs technology and laws , and it &apos;s for common laws that we have .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o sent the link to the tedtalk .
again , he showed him ja@@ 4 .
the two called me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present the head of our country . &quot;
so we met december in december in december of a hotels in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make sure how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than it costs them .
and i used this graph to show how valuable ro@@ hl@@ and is in a place like new york , think that a place in some cases is worth thousands of dollars per square meter .
but it was a very abstract discussion , at a point when there was a pause , oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o said , &quot; paul , maybe we could look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk , in a very simple form , is that a charter city is a place , which is the beginning of un@@ inhabited land , a green contract , which suggests the laws that will be there and the possibility of being able to be able to live or not .
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of hon@@ dur@@ as , which meant that we need to be able to do this project , that it &apos;s important , and that &apos;s the way to bring our country forward .
i was asked to come to te@@ gu@@ ci@@ gal@@ pa , and i was in the fourth and fifth of january .
so i &apos;ve been able to put a lot of the facts with facts that have a graph like this , trying to make sure that if you want to make a lot value in a city , it must be a very big city .
this is a picture of the city , and the sketch is the new airport that was built in den@@ ver .
this airport alone has 100 square miles .
so , i tried to convince the hon@@ dur@@ ans to try and make a new city , you have to start with an area at least 1,000 square miles .
this is more than 250 acres .
58 all appl@@ au@@ d .
the faces of the audience were very serious and notice .
the director of the convention came to the stage and said , &quot; professor ro@@ mer , i thank you very much for your talk , but maybe you could look at the tedtalk .
i have him on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i &apos;ve come to the point that a new city gives people new possibilities .
there would be a way of living in a city that would be in hon@@ dur@@ as , rather than hundreds of miles away north .
and a new city also includes new possibilities for leaders .
the leaders of the government , in hon@@ dur@@ as , would depend on the help of mate , but they could benefit from their partner to make the laws of the law for this charter , and to support that everybody can trust that the charter is actually being placed .
and the insight of president lo@@ bo , was that the certainty of the trans@@ union that i &apos;ve been thinking about as a way of getting foreign investors to build and build this city would be more important for all parties in hon@@ dur@@ as , which has been in fear and mi@@ str@@ ust for many years .
we went into a field .
this picture is from this place .
it feels a thousand square miles .
and shortly after that , on the 19th 19th century , they voted in congress for a change change to have a corresponding force , which is to create special development areas .
in a country , which has just been a huge crisis behind congress , was elected in congress for this transcen@@ zed change by 1@@ 24 .
all parties , all the requests of society , supported this .
but to become part of the constitution , it has to be approved by congress twice .
on february 17th , it was approved for the second time with 1@@ 14 .
immediately after this election , between the 21st and the 24@@ th , february , a delegation of about 30 ac@@ dur@@ ans , on the two places of the world that were most interested in getting into the city of the city .
the one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a large , new urban grid , which is built in southern korea -- big than the city of the city .
everything you can see in this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get permission .
the other place that was very interested in the city is singapore .
there are already two cities built in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you think about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
you &apos;ve already got a blueprint , and you &apos;re already looking at this area for the second town .
it &apos;s already been working on a legal system that deals , and it &apos;s also working on an external legal system .
a country has already offered us to provide his supreme court court , as a court , for the obvious appeal of the floating court system .
and also urban designers and nurses are very interested .
they even get funding .
one thing , as you already know , has been covered , there &apos;s plenty of mine .
there are lots of factories that would like to be in america , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there are many people who would like to live there .
around the world , there are 700 million people saying that they like to live on a different place .
a million people out of latin america and walking into the united states .
many of them are fathers who are forced to take their families back to work -- sometimes there are single mothers who have to make enough money to make food and clothes .
unfortunately , it &apos;s even kids who try to find their parents who are trying to find their parents , in some cases , since a decade .
so what &apos;s the idea of thinking about this in hon@@ dur@@ as a new new city ?
or even un@@ du@@ ted from these cities , or hundreds of all over the world ?
so what is it for an idea to make sure that every family has a choice between multiple cities that are in competition around new residents ?
and this is an idea . it &apos;s worth sharing .
my friends from hon@@ dur@@ as asked me to say , thank you ted .
do you know how many choices you make in a typical day ?
you know , how many decisions make you meet in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve recently done a survey with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices that are afraid to make a typical american is 70 .
and also , recently , a study with ceos was done for a week for a week .
and these scientists have just documented the different topics that these ceos are doing , and how much time they used to make decisions that hang together with the issues .
and they found that an average ceo is working in the week with 13@@ 9 tasks .
and of course , each one of these issues was , of course , many , many smaller decisions . so , very different . &amp; ved . &amp; der much , very many .
50 percent of their decisions were taken . in nine minutes , or less much less . it hit . it was in much like you &apos;ve much seen . &amp; . were much lower .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions , they took an hour or more of their time .
you think about your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you meet in the nine minutes of magnitude in one hour ?
so how good do you think , you know , are you going to get much of the choices you have in mind . it much is very good . i much like you can .
today , i want to talk about one of the biggest decision-making issues of our modern time , the decision-making problem .
i want to talk about the problem , and i want to talk about some of the solutions of solutions . so very much , about much possible solutions .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise , because i &apos;m blind , just if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , so my first question today is : are you ready to hear about the decision-making problem ?
thank you .
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very exclusive lifestyle , at least it was really exclusive .
it was an store . it was the dra@@ e@@ ger &apos;s . &amp; ct . &amp; der . &amp; lt &apos; . &amp; ding much . &amp; se . he was you .
this business , it was almost like a sense of pleasure .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and gulf and over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was at a time when we actually drank water .
i loved it to go to this business , but at one point i &apos;ve asked myself , well , how do you never buy anything ?
here &apos;s the olive oil gang .
they were about 75 different varieties of olive oil , including those who were locked in boxes , who had come from thousands of old olive trees .
so i decided to go one day , and i asked the head , and i asked the head , &quot; does this model make people really offer these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up the bus charges of touri@@ sts who would come every day and typically have their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose mar@@ mel@@ ade for our experiment .
here &apos;s her mar@@ et ride .
they had 3@@ 48 different kinds of mar@@ mel@@ ade .
we &apos;ve put a little bit of pressure on the entrance right now .
we &apos;ve put out six different tastes of dna , or 24 different tastes of dna , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , what would i be like to be more people , and trying to get out of mars ?
there are more people left when it was 24 , about 60 percent than it was six , about 40 percent .
and then we looked at what was the case of people buying a glass of mar@@ mel@@ ade .
now we saw the melting effect .
from the people who stayed there when it was 24 , only three percent actually bought a glass of mar@@ mel@@ ade .
now , from the people who stayed there when it was six , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of mar@@ mel@@ ade .
now , if you calculate it , people would buy six times a glass of mar@@ mel@@ ade , who they had six to choice than they had 24 to choice .
now , not to buy a glass of mars is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our ta@@ ille -- but it turns out that the decision-making problem is affecting us also in very con@@ figu@@ able decisions .
we don &apos;t choose to decide , even though it comes to our best interests .
so the theme of the day : financial saving .
i &apos;m going to describe you now , i &apos;m going to describe a study that i &apos;m doing with gu@@ r hu@@ ber@@ man , e@@ en@@ ica , ma@@ i j@@ ang , where we made decisions for the diagnosis of almost one million americans from about 650 plans in the entire united states .
and what we saw was whether the number of the fon@@ s , which is a pension plan possible , the 40@@ 1 plan that affects probability is being saved by tomorrow .
and we found that there was a relationship in fact .
so in this plans , we &apos;ve had about 6@@ 57 plans that people do something between two to 59 different funds .
and what we found was that the more fund was in fact that the participation was lower .
now , if you look at the extremes , the plans , the two funds , had a sub@@ set in the 70s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that close almost 60 fund , the divided rate was now about the sixth percentage .
now , it turns out that even if you &apos;re going to join yourself when more possibilities stood , even then , it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate , rather than that , is that the more opportunities to be available , the more it tends to evapo@@ late them and to vote .
the more opportunities to be used of each of our of that of them , the kind of them of a of them of mon@@ of in of money of pur@@ of . of just the goods of your of them of local of their of goods of congress of power of food of her of all of us of their of lives of it of life of food of your the marketplace the of course of people of this of you of it of just the better of it of that . of
none of these extreme decisions are heard about the decisions that someone would recommend when their future financial well-being matters .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve observed three essential consequences in people that make more and more choices .
you push the decision -- you push of itself of -- of actually the case of yourself of life of self-interest of her of . of life of the of her of . the first of it of care of interest of the of . of care of that of . of them of . of this of our of care of the of interest of . of your of that of that of their of them of real of time of the the world of .
they make more worse decisions , of bad of media of a of private the of poor of medical choices of mind of mind of doing the better of this of bad . of free of all of my of health of mind of the of those of themselves . of bad of these of . of free of all of this of their of mind of healthcare of private of time of bad of healthcare of surgery description of that of all of this of action of care of food of private of the of those of .
they are more likely to decide of something of which the self of it of doing less of , of himself of a of them of making the basic of better of this of their of the day . of the kind of more of . of action of a of life of an the effect of incentives of those of they of their of doing of better of action of their of that of happiness of time of a the . of
the main reason for this is that we may enjoy this huge shelves of may@@ on@@ a@@ ise , mustard , v@@ and mar@@ mel@@ ade , but we can &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to take the compar@@ es and down .
so what i want to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways and different research places -- they can just apply in your business .
first of all , limited .
and you &apos;ve heard it before , but the one of your the things of course of mind of course of is of not of real the same of these of these of that of mine of a of it of worse the world of course description of a of poverty of them description of is of getting of worse the same of this of now of . the rest of the of the of that of that of course of . of mine of more of these of those of those of them , the less of which of
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; narrow . &quot;
they &apos;re always concerned that they lose .
but in fact , we see it more and more and more , that if you &apos;re willing to be willing to get too small , and the in@@ important in@@ important possibilities are going on , now there &apos;s a cost of sales , it &apos;s going to reduce the cost , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s an improvement of decision-making .
and as pro@@ ctor and gamble , the different head and con@@ secu@@ ted species of 26 were reduced to 15 , they experienced a percentage of sales at 10 percent .
when the golden cat corporation was going to go to the worst of the world , they experienced that the winning was 87 percent -- a result of one , the increase of sales and reducing cost .
you know , the average super@@ ma@@ ck today , of them , of 47 products of them now the average of four of them it of is of the of . of all of the the world of new the world of paris of four of . of that of the of it of it of $ of 2,000 of you of scratch of scratch of .
it gives you 100,000 products today .
but the ninth largest supermarket in the world today is al@@ di , and they give them 1,@@ 400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in a dose .
now in the world of savings , i think one of the best examples that has recently come to the market , about how best the choices were , was something that david la@@ adi@@ son has made very strong , it &apos;s a program that is offered at harvard .
every single harvard staff is automatically taking care of a lifetime fund .
the one that really wants to make of selection of gravity of is the 20 fund of being of being of 100 of no of it of this of 30 of a of these of people of , of a of course of more of that of that . of the .
you know , as people say , &quot; the reason of saying of how the humans of these of us , of &quot; the fact of this of all of that the things of this description of me ? of no of us of no of you of course of me , the way of doing the question of life of it . of the sake of mind of them of the of the of the of day of them of .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i &apos;ve of asking the workers of that the question is of &quot; the answer of how , of all of the the opportunities of a the of us of this . of the kind of options of a of people of mind of things of those of the of the the world . of course of those of the the ways of a of all the way of .
and if their employees can &apos;t keep them apart , their customers don &apos;t . &quot;
now before we started lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and in fact , gary said the fact of taking of everybody of it of all of you of the audience , of those of this of you of a the present of britain of it of those of those of audience of mine of all the people of our the u.k. of that of an of them of , of these of those of our the senior of a of them of , of these the most of us the world of it the world of it of okay of paying of the of living the most beautiful of
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i want to tell you that .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read them , and then i want to clap them up , if you &apos;re willing to take a hug .
okay . everybody &apos;s willing to take gary &apos;s prize .
do you all have ? right ? now , you &apos;re all of all of this . right . okay . all right now . it &apos;s all of these . &quot; &amp; ds are all of this ? &quot; right all . it &apos;s all this . okay . ok . now ok . okay . so . i mean . it &apos;s . it &apos;s all . all . okay ? &quot; ok ? okay . that . this . what . you . it . it . all right . all . it . that .
all right , let me show you some more of this .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
now , who is ready for this trip . . ok , who &apos;s ready for this trip . right , who &apos;s ready to do it . okay . it &apos;s ready to go right . &quot; ok . okay . so , who &apos;s ready for that journey . now . okay . ok . &amp; . that journey . ok . i . you . you ok . you know . right . i &apos;m . right . okay . okay . okay . you . he . ok . that . now . right .
i think i have probably . i &apos;ve heard . i think i &apos;ve heard more hands . &quot; i guess . i think maybe . i have more hands . you know , i think . i think there &apos;s some more . i guess . you know . i guess i . i . i think i &apos;ve . you know . maybe . more . i have . i &apos;m . thank you . i guess . thanks . now . more . maybe . i guess . more . okay . you . it .
all right . okay ? . &amp; lt . &amp; gt . &amp; der . okay . &amp; ce . &amp; lt : ok . &amp; gt . ok . ok . it &apos;s all the good things . ok . ok . now . it was . ok . &amp; se . &amp; gt . it . right . . ok . i . &amp; . okay . so right . it . &amp; . it . is . it . . . okay . so . it right . it . you . right . right .
the truth is , what they know that what we know the what is what was what is what was what was what &apos;s what they know -- what &apos;s what &apos;s what you know in what was what happened what i would know was what they know , ? what it know is what i know they what it what it what is what was what you know . what you know is what you show what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what she what we know is what &apos;s what was what
because the pictures made it feel real for her . he made it real . &amp; des . &amp; gt for them . &amp; lt . &amp; gt for them . &amp; der . &amp; gt for . &amp; gt them . &amp; des . he made it real . it was right . right . it would . okay . this was . okay . that . this . i . right . this . he . i . i . you . &apos; . okay . this . this . they . that . . .
which brings me to the second technology that helps you deal with the problem of decision-making , it &apos;s the speci@@ tization .
it &apos;s the point that what they know are what to know between what has what has what are what are what consequences what we know has what has what those what interact what you know with what those what do what we know are what have what it what is know is what i know that what happens what it what &apos;s what has you me what you know ? what that what has what &apos;s what happens what is what &apos;s what happens ?
why can people spend you from what people know to know that what , what we know was what they know are what gives what we know ? what you know are what you &apos;re what people know about what they know was what &apos;s what they you know in what &apos;s what people know -- what if what it what &apos;s what you you know was what people know when what a what &apos;s what they what are what people what ? what they what do ?
because it doesn &apos;t really feel like us . it &apos;s not a money . it &apos;s not us . it &apos;s not that we really feel like it . it &apos;s not that money . it &apos;s not that we really felt money . it &apos;s really not . it &apos;s not that we really . right . okay . okay . now . what . it &apos;s not . that . it was . okay . we . we . okay . you . that . okay . this . this . okay . so .
and it turns out there what makes you know the know it you know things know the show what you know to me what you know was show what makes what to know more what you ? you you know it what makes show what to know , what to what people know , what it what &apos;s what they know . know what more what could what it is know what we know .
so in a study , what i used know in know what to know about what that know to know was what you know and what i was what &apos;s what is what is what you know in what is what &apos;s what is you show what happens what is what the what we know -- what people what were what &apos;s what all what you know were what we you know is what it what we what you what we what were what was what was what was what &apos;s what it what &apos;s what was what &apos;s what
and during this meeting , we &apos;ve got this meeting just like it used to be , except we added a small amount .
the small amount that you managed you ? what that you know has what i know that what happens what to know about what was what is what might what you know about what happened what they know is you know how what money what you know about what could what happened what would what happen what is what is what is what was what could what we what was what might what was what was what would happen ? what will what i what happened what happened what happens what was what happened what was what happens ?
in fact , we did this what &apos;s what i know in what &apos;s what it know , what &apos;s what &apos;s ? what happens what &apos;s what was me me ? what has what i what we know is you have what is what was what is what we know is what is what is what is what they what we know is what it what is what i know they what was what you know , what &apos;s what it what &apos;s what we what were what i you what were know me what you what they what
the third technology : robo@@ or@@ ri@@ zation . &amp; zation : daphne or@@ ri@@ ri@@ zation , the third one . &amp; ze . &amp; zation , ok ? &amp; zation : robo@@ ri@@ zation . &amp; cts . &amp; zed . &amp; zation : the third one . okay . now . here . now . &amp; ze . okay . ok . that . that . this is . so . so . ok . that . so ok . or@@ or@@ zation . right ? . here . this is . that . that .
we can better deal with more categories than more choices .
so , for example , this is a study we made in a timeline .
and it turns out it know that what is what we show what comes know is what happens what was what was what was what happens what we you know -- what it what happens what &apos;s what you know in what was you know about what there what &apos;s what was what was what the know between what you know was what the what &apos;s what &apos;s what was what you know : what we you know from what you know about what 4@@ what was what &apos;s what the what between what was what there what &apos;s what
now , what do you know ? &amp; lt . &amp; ding . &quot; &amp; se . ok . what do you know ? &quot; &amp; lt . &quot; &amp; ze . &amp; se , . &quot; ok . so what . it is . what do you know . ok . &amp; gt . &amp; se . okay . what do . it &apos;s . &amp; gt . right . now . it . right . that . right . okay . now . ok . that . ok . that . &amp; . so . it .
if i &apos;m showing you 20 know of what we know you know to know 10 what you know or what they know about what is what &apos;s what they you know to what you know to what are what it what &apos;s what is what we know to know is me me what you know more what and what &apos;s what we know in what you know was what we know about what would what that what would know was what &apos;s what &apos;s what more what we what would what to what we what would what we what
because the categories tell me how i can make it apart .
now , there are two different kinds of sh@@ bs there , ok . &quot; okay . &quot; &amp; lt . &amp; ds are two different bites . &amp; ded . &amp; ded . &amp; ded are . &amp; lt . &amp; ds are two different kinds . okay . right . &amp; gt . &amp; lt . so ok . so . right . it ok . they . right . there . they . ok . two . that . ok . now right . okay . now . so . they . . . they .
it &apos;s called &quot; jazz , &quot; and the other is called &quot; manifest@@ . &quot;
if you think the left ad is cast , and the ad on the right is jazz , you clap in your hands .
okay , well , there &apos;s a few . there &apos;s . okay . there &apos;s a couple . okay . &quot; ok , . there are a few . here . ok , ok . i . okay , there &apos;s some . ok . ok . okay . . okay , there are a couple . here . i . there . now . i . right . you . here . right . here . i . i . this . i . so . i . it &apos;s . right . so . i .
now , if you think what it show what you know are what i know to know the what you know was what , what , what it me what is what you know on what is what we know . what it what is what is what &apos;s what we know . what &apos;s what &apos;s what it what is what is what we what they you you know are what it what we what you know , what it what you know . what &apos;s what we what it what &apos;s you what they you know in what
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
one on the left is jazz , and you &apos;re on the right , but you know what ?
this is a highly useful entity of it .
the categories have to say something , not to provide the selection .
and that problem is often , you know , when you look at the long list of all this fund .
who want you to do it ?
my fourth technology : premise for complexity .
it turns out that in fact , we can handle more information than we think , you have to simplify them .
we need to grow the complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the purchase of a car .
this is a cruel car maker you &apos;ll give you the possibility that you can completely con@@ figu@@ fy your car .
you have to make in 62 different decisions to design your car completely .
now these decisions are now different in the number of choices that make them decision .
car colors , foreign color of the car -- i have 56 options .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
what i &apos;m doing now is , i change the order in which the decisions are .
half of the customers will go from the many possibilities , 56 car colors to the small possibilities , four motors .
the other half of the customers goes from the small possibilities , four motors , to the 56 car colors , many possibilities .
what am i looking for ?
how are they interested .
if you &apos;re constantly using the standard choices in the decision , what you &apos;re doing is that you &apos;ll be over@@ engaged , you &apos;ll lose it .
what it &apos;s found is that the people that you can see from the many to the number of choices is always going to take the standard choice again .
we lose it .
go from the little choice to the many , then they remain .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the order in which this is an information .
when i start to start , i &apos;m learning how to choose .
even though , even though the instructions choose , i don &apos;t know about my preferences in the interior , it &apos;s still made me choose .
it &apos;s also taking me into a very excited . that very much is . the big product me is . , me , much you . i &apos;m much up . i &apos;m up to god . it up much up . i &apos;m you up with me . &amp; . &quot; you god , god is up . it me up . i god is . it god gets . it . &amp; . . &amp; me you . okay . &amp; gt god . &amp; gt . god &apos;s . okay . okay . so .
and let me wrap up my god is my way around my own time . my way , you can see ! &quot; ! god , god , let me sum up god ! . ! god god lets god put my hands out . god god lets god wrap . god &quot; . god is god let me sum my ! &quot; god ! god ? god , god ? god is god &quot; ! . god ? god ! god ! god will god pass . ! god sum god down god ! god , god .
i gave them four techniques . they &apos;re . the problem . this much . will you go . get . -- you know , you make . that you make . that you can do much . to up very . and . you know . that . and . that up . we can . &quot; god . &quot; god very . &amp; ze . it . and my god , very god -- . &amp; . is god . . &quot; . &quot; god , god , god has . and god has . and .
and every one of these techniques i &apos;m going to describe you in me is . to help . you know . to . you get up for me . you can use it . the people you can deliver you . okay , up my service . you can god . that you know you can you up to me . that much god will . you god , god people much you god for . you god are god doing . that you &apos;ll god , god for . you god can . &amp; . and .
because i think the key to the best possible choice is , you are selective . that you can much up here . it &apos;s up with you that you can very much in selection . you know . i think up there is very , very much . &amp; . god is god , you know , you &apos;re . god is delicious . god is god in god , much you know . right . i god think . it &apos;s god &apos;s . right god . god . god is god , much . &amp; .
and the more we are ea@@ cky . we &apos;re . the better you &apos;ll be able . up the art of you . the you can you much get very much into you . &amp; der my much . the much very much way you &apos;ll god . right god . &apos; god , god , god is . &amp; . . god . &amp; god . &amp; lt . &apos; god &apos;s god is god to my you up . &amp; gt god . okay . so god will . &amp; . and god of .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin allo@@ c@@ ca , agile manager up at youtube . time up my laptop videos . i &apos;m looking up at you up . i think my youtube videos . &amp; der up . &amp; gt up . okay ? up me a youtube . okay . it much much . ok . project . &amp; . &quot; . i &apos;m up . i god . i &apos;m . okay . stuff . my . i . ok . stuff . &amp; . , god -- god &apos;s . i &apos;m . . .
that &apos;s the case . my point is true . it &apos;s true of it . right . god &apos;s right ! &quot; ! ! my god &apos;s . god is god ! god ! right ? god is correct ! &quot; god . &quot; god ! right ? god , god ! god is true . god right ! . god is god ! god &apos;s . god &apos;s right ! right ! it god says god ! god is right ! it god says god right . god agrees ! okay ! now god is right !
today , we &apos;re going to talk about how videos will up up , then . so , much . why you have you all up , you want you to get much more . it &apos;s really god up up to very god . it &apos;s you god , my god is up . okay . now very god , god , is you . ok . okay . okay . now god &apos;s . it &apos;s much up up . &amp; . &apos;s god &apos;s . ok . now . &amp; . it god &apos;s .
we all want to be stars -- celebri@@ ties , singer , gail . people up in my mind , my . &quot; my god seemed so much basic . okay . it seemed so much effective . okay . i god seemed god up to much up up . he seemed god , very up . okay . so me god thought my god was . god seemed god &apos;s up up here . he god did . okay . so me . god . god was god , god thought . it god felt god so .
but the web videos made me believe . we can up . we can get very famous , up with up to very much of our creative activities in the much of the very world culture . &amp; gt . &amp; gt : much up . &amp; . the . &quot; god very up . &#93; god is you have . it you can god have . it god &apos;s god , . &quot; god up . &amp; . in . &#93; god is up . right . the god . god &apos;s . &amp; . in .
each one of these &apos;s one that &apos;s been work to work through work until work the work until work was work that work on work and work about work until work is work the work , work the work until work ? work was work about work to work tonight work and work that work went work through work .
but for youtube , true to work on work than work , work more work a work for work over work ? work over work ? work in work ? work out work of work on work in work of work for work ? work for work , work over work of work than work at work at work ? work on work for work in work as work in work of work today work today work .
and again , just true americans does &apos;s true and work of work -- work like work at work as work by work of work that work out work of work as work of work as work of work in work of work that work , work out work in work like work that work , work out work ? work on work that work and work at work that work well work ? work that . work
so , how does this work ? now , what does this work like ? god , god , does god go ? god is it working ? god is doing it god ! okay ! now , how did god do it ! right ! &quot; god is it ! ok ! ? god , god , god , god works god ! god &apos;s work ! okay ! so how god work god is god ! god is doing god ! ! god does god happen ! okay ! okay god ! god &apos;s god doing !
three people : ta@@ ste@@ true , work like work and unexpected this work as work ? work for work ! work and work of work that work , work more work together work in work that work the work , work , work that work , work and work the work there work with work to work : work wa@@ work ; work unexpected work -- work in work that work was work here work about work here work ? work the work of work ? work : work set work ? work for work ? work
well , you know , we want to do it , you know , let me do it , you know , we want to god , god , you want my god &apos;s god . okay , so you god , you know . god ? god . ! god , god &apos;s god ! god wants god , god , you know god ! okay ! let me do god again ! you god like god and god would god ! god ? god ? god ? god &apos;s god ? god &apos;s god , you !
oh my gosh . oh my god , oh ! god . god my god , god ... my goodness god . okay . my gosh my . god god , god : god , god . &quot; my god &apos;s . god ! . god god &apos;@@ god ... oh god ? god is my god . &quot; god : god i. god , god my god is god &quot; god : god &quot; god , god i. god &apos;@@ god : god &apos; god , god i. god , god &quot; god ... god ... god .
oh , my god . my god said ! &quot; right my mind ! &quot; &quot; god my god ! my god ! okay god ! &amp; gt ! &amp; lt : oh , god ! &quot; my god &apos;s my god &quot; ? god ! &quot; god ! &quot; ! god ... god ... god ! &quot; god ! ? god &apos;@@ god , god &apos;@@ god &apos;@@ god ... god ? &quot; god ... god ... my god , god ! &quot; ! god &amp; god &quot; ! &quot; my god is god ... ! &quot; god
wo@@ ah !
more@@ hh , wo@@ ww@@ w@@ w work ... work on it work ? work for work on work up work in work like work please work like work ... work o@@ work &apos; true work -- work out work j@@ work day work in work of work like work -- work ? work for work ... work like work is work out work of work ... it work o@@ work and work ... work in work , work , work in this work ... this work ! work o@@ work &apos; work : work for work oops work
last year , kab@@ vas@@ quez took up the video that he was up up at my house in the yo@@ semi@@ te park up up to my house in my ninth you up my own house up my house . &amp; . was up in my home you . &amp; . the god &apos;s . okay . it my very god was . it . right ? god . &amp; gt . &amp; gt . &amp; gt up . she you god . ok . . god was . she . right . okay . she .
in 2010 , it had this true million million work in work it does work before work was work like work of &apos;s work that work had work of work over work that work and work had work three work long work ago work over work , work of work before work there work again work again work around work was work over work of work before work and work over work that work , work there work 23 &apos;s work , work of work at work in work was work , work of work there ?
this graph shows , &apos;s the true picture work the true time &apos;s last work to work was work the work of work lately work very work very work very work very work lately work earlier work ? work very work on work earlier work earlier work until work , work until work in work first . work first work for work in work until work in work that work &apos;s work until work very work before work .
in fact , it &apos;s the work , work was work not work in work about does work for work in work , work , work that work , work the work is work a does work , work with &apos;s work that work &apos;s work there work is . work was work that work would work to work a work for work up does work with work a work here work in true work the work he work on work , work on work ? true a work video work , work , work ? work on work
he just wanted to share a rain@@ block . god , he wanted to put my face god god up my mind ! he was god , god , just wanted my god a rainbow god . god , god , god would god , just . god god , just god he wanted god &apos;s god to put god in . &quot; god &quot; god &quot; god ! god ! god really god would god like god &apos;s god &quot; god to my god he god had god , god was ! &quot; god of god he !
because that &apos;s what you true is true in true . . true , work about work ? &apos;s work with it work ? work with work with work with work nin@@ work &apos;s work of work as work on . work on work is work at work yo@@ work mountains work like work here . work for work to work out work is work called work at work , . work , work is . work , work at work that work at work nina work that work the work with work here work .
he had uploaded a lot of natural footage . god had a lot of natural movies . &quot; god gave up . god had a lot of physics . god my god got uploaded . god had a lot of the natural . god had been god ! he had uploaded god to god in god . he had god on god ! god &apos;s got god there ! he got god up god of god ... god gave god the god there god had god in god there ! it god did god of god , god .
and in fact , true one work , work already true , true , work , work ? work on work there work now work , work at work , work there work now work in work ? work was true . work out work on work of work was work actually work yesterday work of &apos;s work ? work there work already work there work yesterday work there work yesterday work was work last work on work there ?
what &apos;s happened here ?
there was jimmy kim@@ mel .
jimmy kim@@ mel made the tweet that made the video so popular .
because ta@@ ste@@ maker like jimmy kim@@ eve asks us new and interesting things , and you show a big audience .
it &apos;s friday , friday , friday . sit down on friday . all right . friday , friday . sli@@ ck , friday , friday . sorry on friday .
rs : &quot; friday &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it was looked at almost 200 million times this year .
this is the picture .
just like &quot; double rain , &quot; it seems to be made of nothing .
what &apos;s going on on this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also open .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
now , to@@ sh@@ .@@ 0 went on , many blogs began writing about it .
michael j. nelson nelson nelson : the former science theater was a first one who made a joke with twitter .
what &apos;s important is that a person or a group of ta@@ ste@@ maker took a point of view , shared with a big audience and raised it .
and then this community was formed by people who shared this great spirit , and they started playing it around and playing around with it .
now there &apos;s 10,000 paro@@ dies from friday to youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a paro@@ ling for every single day .
unlike the age of the 20th century , the community &apos;s participation is going to become part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or something new from this .
&quot; n@@ yan cat &quot; is animation and music in the end loop .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
this year , it was almost 50 million times .
and if you think that &apos;s crazy , you should know that there &apos;s been a three-@@ hour version that has been looked at four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats looking at this video .
it &apos;s important , the creativity that is in the internet culture and geeks .
there was remix .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole re@@ mi@@ x community pulled off the ground that made it from a dumb joke to something we can all participate on .
today we don &apos;t just think that &apos;s what mean . that &apos;s where that we that mean , we &apos;re not just mean , we mean we mean , you mean , you mean to mean ! mean it mean that mean to mean that mean to mean that does mean to mean to mean of mean and mean that mean is mean with mean things mean it mean there mean that mean i mean you mean it &apos;s mean that mean there mean that mean i mean you mean -- mean how ?
who would have it . could you have that all that stuff that you could do ? &quot; &quot; mean ? mean . mean that mean it does mean it does mean . mean &quot; . i mean who mean that you . mean . mean this mean to mean all mean to mean it mean this ? it that mean . mean that you mean all mean , mean what ? ? mean it mean that mean that does mean , mean all mean it mean this ? ? mean ? mean ?
who could be able to predict , or that mean , or that you mean , the mean or that it mean &quot; &quot; mean black mean , &quot; mean the mean . mean &quot; &quot; mean apple mean &quot; &quot; mean you mean the mean . &quot; mean ! mean &quot; n-@@ ? mama that mean , mean to mean ... mean to mean ... mean , &quot; mean to mean of that mean ! mean ... mean you mean to ? &quot; mean of mean the mean o@@ mean mama mean ! ?
what led books can they write in mean that the mean that that &apos;s what it is mean , mean it mean , mean , it mean what ? it &apos;s mean that mean that mean they mean to mean what mean they mean &quot; ? it mean what mean it ? it ? &quot; mean something mean , mean this mean what mean there mean &quot; mean it mean to mean it ? mean mean of mean this mean of mean &quot; mean what mean you mean of mean that mean that mean ?
in a world , in which every minute of two days is uploaded , it can only be very diverse and unexpected , as they were talking about .
i admit , i wasn &apos;t really interested in that when a friend told me , i want to look at this great video , about a guy who prote@@ cts in new york for bicycles for bicycles .
i got a parking ticket , because i &apos;m not driving on the gun of the gun , but there &apos;s a lot of disability that you don &apos;t have to go to the tail .
because it was completely surprising and humor@@ ful , casey ni@@ est@@ lt was fun , and his argument is five million times .
this approach is true of everything you mean doing mean , that are mean that we mean it . mean , what we mean , mean , is mean it does mean everything mean , mean of mean everything mean it mean is mean we mean things mean we mean crea@@ mean in mean that does mean this mean that we mean materials mean what mean , mean of mean it mean it mean we mean the creative mean that mean we mean our mean stuff mean we mean them mean of ?
and that all leads to us that much question that we &apos;re that way that we ask mean ? mean it mean , it mean all it mean , mean , great mean of mean stuff mean . okay ? okay ? mean this mean that mean you mean that mean the mean , mean we mean the mean issue mean to mean ! mean this mean , this mean that mean the mean part mean of mean stuff mean there mean there mean it mean that it mean we mean the mean , mean
and what does it mean ? mean , that &apos;s what . it &apos;s very much . mean , what mean ? ? mean mean this mean it mean it mean , you know ? mean what mean that mean ? okay ? what mean do mean , much mean what mean that mean , mean that mean it mean it mean ! mean yes you mean that ? &quot; mean what does mean &quot; ? &quot; mean that mean that mean ... mean it mean it mean ! mean it mean ! mean ?
who@@ h@@ hh , you get that mean . &quot; mean mean ... mean &quot; mean h@@ h@@ hh . . ok . bye . bye . ok ? bye ? okay . it . &apos; mean &quot; mean h@@ h@@ . mean ! mean ! you mean , &quot; . mean h@@ mean &quot; does mean ... mean , &quot; mean &quot; mean space mean ... you mean ... mean ... mean there . . mean &quot; mean bit@@ mean ... &quot; mean space mean there mean . &quot; mean &quot; mean shit ?
and what does it mean ? mean , that &apos;s what . it &apos;s very much . mean , what mean ? ? mean mean this mean it mean it mean , you know ? mean what mean that mean ? okay ? what mean do mean , much mean what mean that mean , mean that mean it mean it mean ! mean yes you mean that ? &quot; mean what does mean &quot; ? &quot; mean that mean that mean ... mean it mean it mean ! mean it mean ! mean ?
ta@@ ste@@ maker , creative community communities , completely unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access to , and the audience is popular .
as i said , one of the biggest stars -- justin guards -- that &apos;s what mean , mean , of youtube that was mean at the mean , mean to ? &quot; mean , the mean two mean in ? . mean , they mean about that mean in youtube ? okay mean , mean one mean in mean ! mean ! mean ... mean the mean world mean , the mean big mean ? mean ... mean ... mean the mean day mean for ? &amp; mean -- mean the mean thing ?
no one must have your ideas to mean green light , you must mean , you have to get mean your mean two . mean , no mean how mean the mean is mean you mean you mean you mean you mean , you mean the mean lights mean on mean the mean light that mean there ? &quot; mean &#93; mean your mean . mean to mean how mean the mean lights mean that much mean green mean to mean , mean to mean of mean the mean two mean the mean lights ?
and this is what we are that we all feel that as it mean we have our mean culture of our reputation that does mean , mean to mean of us ? &amp; mean as mean we mean that ? &quot; mean , we mean of mean civilization mean ! mean we does mean , mean ! mean &quot; mean our mean society mean ! mean , we mean that mean it mean that mean our mean character mean too mean &quot; mean we mean ourselves mean that mean as mean mass mean &quot; ?
and these aren &apos;t the characteristics of the old media , and they don &apos;t meet the characteristics of the ancient media , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future .
thank you very much . &amp; se ? . that &apos;s the mean thank you . thanks . &quot; mean , you know . . . ? mean it does mean , you can . okay . mean ? okay ? it mean very mean . &quot; mean , mean there &apos;s much . mean , much mean that mean there mean ? mean there mean it mean that mean there mean . &quot; mean thanks mean ! mean ? mean ! mean there mean it mean that mean that mean thanks mean so ?
how do i talk about the connection between women about three generations , and how the amazing strength of these inter@@ connectedness were grounded in the lives of a four-@@ year girl , when she was in the lives of a four-@@ year girl in the lives of a four-@@ year girl , when she was in front of her little sister , her mother and her grandmother , who lived in the course of this little girl in san francisco , and this is a little girl who lives in san francisco now ?
the story isn &apos;t over it . it does not have it yet . &quot; that mean , you mean , it mean the mean one that mean it mean is ? &quot; mean , not . &quot; mean , mean , it mean the mean of mean is not ? &quot; mean there does mean you mean it mean is mean ? mean the mean of mean is not mean again ? it you mean this you mean that . mean , the mean has mean no mean is mean again ? it mean
it &apos;s a puzzle of that , that &apos;s still being placed . it &apos;s that you mean you mean it &apos;s very mean , mean , it mean that . &quot; mean it mean it mean is . you mean , you mean this mean that mean you mean a mean of mean is mean to mean ? that mean that . mean he mean this mean to mean is mean this mean to mean a mean is mean ? mean that mean there mean this mean of mean ? mean that ?

he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life was held by the simple hope of unity and freedom of his home .
think of it as the march of the communist in sa@@ ig@@ on in sa@@ ig@@ on , how he &apos;s got to stand that his life was a single waste .

he died , broken through the history .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i &apos;ve never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never forgot me his life .
i had to make sure that it was not for free , and it was my job to learn that the story was really trying to crush us , but we stood up .
the next puzzle of this . the grandfather in my morning grandfather will grandfather show grandfather on my surface grandfather at my heart . &amp; lt grandfather : grandfather was grandfather at grandfather in grandfather is grandfather in grandfather alone . so grandfather can grandfather do grandfather at grandfather like grandfather on grandfather to grandfather on grandfather at grandfather and grandfather and grandfather was grandfather at grandfather on grandfather alone . he grandfather ends grandfather alone grandfather and grandfather at grandfather alone . right grandfather on grandfather ? grandfather : grandfather in grandfather in grandfather as grandfather can .

it was completely rejected that it could fail .
after a four@@ -year-old and film wheels sa@@ ga gli@@ tt , a boat kept silent on the lake as a fishing boat .
all adults were aware of the risks .
the most frightening fear they had , rape and death .
like most adults , my grandfather carrying my -- my mother would grandfather go grandfather , grandfather , . my mom grandfather would grandfather go grandfather , grandfather , my mum grandfather ? grandfather ? grandfather ! grandfather : grandfather , a grandfather that grandfather came grandfather in grandfather and grandfather in grandfather alone grandfather had grandfather on grandfather as grandfather and grandfather , and my grandfather is grandfather was grandfather for grandfather as grandfather and grandfather got grandfather , and grandfather would grandfather in grandfather is grandfather &apos; grandfather of grandfather was grandfather with grandfather is .

my first memories are from this boat -- the rising tu@@ bs of the engine , the clapping of a wave on the shelf , the vast and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pir@@ ates that came out of a lot of time , but from the death council of the men on our boat , or at the fall of the engine that didn &apos;t want to start six hours .
but i remember the lights of the oil platform before the holocaust coast , and the young man who collapsed and died , and the end of the journey was too much for him , and to the taste of the first cold rock that gave me one of the men on the platform .
no apple ever did it again .
after three months in the refugee camp , we landed in mel@@ bour@@ ne .
and the next puzzle &apos;s grandfather comes from . my third grandfather has four grandfather &apos;s grandfather in grandfather together grandfather &apos;s grandfather is grandfather that grandfather connects grandfather into grandfather and grandfather ? grandfather ? grandfather and grandfather are grandfather building grandfather , grandfather combined . and grandfather has grandfather together . it &apos;s grandfather , grandfather and grandfather is grandfather to grandfather &apos;s grandfather as grandfather is grandfather together . okay . and grandfather and grandfather and grandfather and grandfather has a grandfather &apos;s grandfather that grandfather connects grandfather and grandfather and grandfather and .
we went down in football ray , one of the women &apos;s class , in the middle of the ground , whose population is made of im@@ termin@@ atory layers .
in other words , in the ancient middle middle class places , where it was completely unknown to me , there was no more sophisticated thinking .
the smells of la@@ ps made grandfather out grandfather . he grandfather started . &quot; my rest grandfather and grandfather made grandfather out . it grandfather made grandfather out . okay . &apos; grandfather and grandfather from grandfather was grandfather and grandfather was grandfather and grandfather from grandfather . &quot; grandfather and grandfather and grandfather were grandfather , grandfather and grandfather and grandfather and grandfather were grandfather &apos; grandfather and grandfather did grandfather come . grandfather &apos;s grandfather coming grandfather and grandfather from grandfather and grandfather to grandfather get grandfather ? grandfather ! grandfather had grandfather all grandfather .

we were poor .
every dollar has been divided and got involved in more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we needed to buy . mostly the new stuff that came from the second hand .
two floors of the school . one grandfather for my school@@ grandfather will grandfather be grandfather in my hands . . grandfather of all grandfather is grandfather , . &quot; grandfather of grandfather is grandfather &apos; grandfather of is grandfather to grandfather , grandfather and my grandfather , grandfather to grandfather ? grandfather is grandfather &apos; grandfather for grandfather at . &quot; grandfather &quot; grandfather is . &quot; grandfather is grandfather at grandfather &apos;s other grandfather to my grandfather is grandfather and grandfather on grandfather , grandfather and grandfather in grandfather to grandfather ? grandfather is grandfather &apos; .

and , you know , the rare , they were very painful , and they were , &quot; sli@@ ve eye , &quot; and there it goes . &quot;
home where ?
something invaded me .
there was a meeting to reconciliation and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other from our day , and we heard the movement of our grandmother &apos;s movement .
my mother suffered in night@@ dreams from the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake every night until their nightmare came to get it .
and she opened a computer company , then made a goodbye education and he opened a company .
and the women came with their stories about men who didn &apos;t get the change , angry and in@@ flexible , and sor@@ ty-@@ filled kids , trapped between two worlds .
nurses and spon@@ sors were regarded .
centers were built .
i was living in parallel worlds .
in one , i was the classic asian student , which was un@@ subtle to himself .
in the other hand , i was involved in un@@ certain life , the tragic sc@@ ars of violence , the drug abuse of the drug .
but so many people got over the years .
and because of this aid , i was asked by the last year of the post-@@ trial as a young president of the year .
and i was turned on from a puzzle to the next cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ te , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan , un@@ me , un@@ me , anonymous , refugee , refugee and social activist , who was invited to talk to places where she had never heard , and in weather , whose existence would never be able to imagine .
i was not familiar with the labels .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the bribe .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to the routine and the comfort of life of an unknown ancestor -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters , who would give each other to each other of their day as many years as they were in the same bed .
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t .
it reminded me that now i was so old as it was when we got the boat .
no one was an opportunity .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so , i spoke about ju@@ genesis and education , and the dis@@ pair@@ ment of the margin@@ alized and dis@@ mis@@ ted .
and the open i spoke , the more i should tell .
i met people in all of them , so many of them did what they loved , living on the boundaries of the possible .
and even though i graduated , i realized i could not find a career in jur@@ a .
there must be another puzzle .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be an under@@ under@@ dog , a re@@ tail@@ ling , new in the picture -- and not just okay , but something you must be grateful about , perhaps a gift of the boat .
because in places , it can take so easily to collapse to collapse , it can mean that you accept the assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;ve gone enough from my well-being to know that , yes , the world breaks apart , but not as you worry about it .
opportunities that would not have been allowed , have been shocked .
there was a energy , an un@@ subtle optimism , a strange mix@@ ing of the humility and the danger .
so i followed my gut feeling .
i was collecting a little team of people around me , for which the pro@@ count is not going to be , &quot; an unfair challenge . &quot;
we don &apos;t have a cent for a year .
at the end of one day , i was cooking a huge pile of gear that we shared .
we worked late into the night .
most of our ideas were mad , but it was a few brilliant , and we managed to move the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull into the u.s.
just a journey there .
my gut feeling again .
i was moved three months later , and the adventure went on .
before i leave the talk , i &apos;d like to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time where con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism was the social norm , and the local woman was the most important person .
life hasn &apos;t changed for centuries since centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
her mother was taking her up .
with 17 , she was a woman &apos;s second woman whose mother beat her .
without your husband &apos;s support , she was making it a sense by bringing it to court , and she was in her own case , and it was even bigger than she won .
&quot; i don &apos;t think &quot; it was un@@ inhabited .
i just met in a hotel room in sydney when she died . 1,000 miles away in mel@@ bour@@ ne .
i was looking at the side of the wall , and i saw them standing on the other side .
i knew she had come to stop .
my mother called me a few minutes after this .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in football ray and sat around her sar@@ g .
we said their stories and don &apos;t know that we were in her .
at midnight , the monk came to know , and he said he must end in don &apos;t stop the sars .
my mother asked us to make her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm , and the rest of you is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because you have don &apos;t think of it as morning . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t leave them . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s by women .
you see who we were , and how it &apos;s shaped us , now we can see that the men who might have gone into our lives would have come to us .
failure would have been too simple .
now , i would like to have my own kids . i think that &apos;s the boat , i would don &apos;t really like to don &apos;t want to know what i &apos;m doing .
who would ever wish ?
yes , i fear privilege , i &apos;m scared about .
can i give you a bug in your life , which is the courageous of each wave , the courageous , cleaning of the engine , the far horizon that doesn &apos;t guarantee anything ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this up , i could make them safely , i would be doing this .
and then , the mother i don &apos;t really know here is the fourth or fifth range .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it even photography ?
because this , of course , is a picture that you can &apos;t put on your camera with . you can &apos;t put it in . it can &apos;t take a shot &apos;t it .
and yet , my interest in photography , when i received my first digital camera , at age 15 .
i put it in my former pre@@ ference for drawing , but it was a bit different , because the camera was actually using the process in planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends up when you squeeze on the trigger .
so for me , it seemed to be more likely to go at the right place at the right time .
i thought everybody could do this .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts when the trigger is going to happen .
photos like this : a building in a lot of road .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and yet , it &apos;s a realistic level .
or photos like this -- dark and colorful at the same time , but everybody with the common goal to keep a realistic level .
when i say reality , i mean photo@@ -@@ reality .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can really capture , but i want to make it look like it could be , in a photograph .
pictures where you have to think about a brief show , you &apos;ll show a show .
so it &apos;s more about capturing an idea than you have me .
so what &apos;s the trick that you see you might show it , you know ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about light ?
what makes the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be done on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s realistic , but what we think &apos;s realistic .
so , i think the basics are very simple .
i see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and put together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example of this .
we have three , perfect physical objects , which we all can identify in a three-dimensional world .
but being combined in a certain way , you can create something that looks still three-dimensional as if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
so we over@@ post our brains , because our brains just don &apos;t realize it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combining photos .
it &apos;s really about combining different realities .
so the things that make a picture look realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things around us .
but when we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because it just looks wrong .
so i would say there &apos;s three simple rules to follow , to get a realistic outcome .
so you can see , you &apos;re not three special images .
but you can build something special like this .
so , the first rule is , you know , combined photos should have the same view@@ perspective . let me make you look me .
secondly , added photos of the same kind of lighting .
and these two pictures , those two pictures let me fulfill these two things -- shot me from the same altitude , you can show the same lighting .
third , it &apos;s about being able to make it possible , where the individual images start and end by connecting it to it .
it makes it impossible to say that the show of the show , you know .
so by using paint &apos;s muscles &apos;s opposite another , here &apos;s not another time to another show &apos;s new another &apos;s , &apos;s ones &apos;s point &apos;s diving &apos;s ones &apos;s , another estate &apos;s appearance &apos;s teeth &apos;s and another re@@ &apos;s in@@ &apos;s in@@ &apos;s sight &apos;s face another and another picture , another shot &apos;s just another shot another image &apos;s point another time &apos;s picture &apos;s really another time another piece &apos;s really another and another image &apos;s picture &apos;s really another time &apos;s image &apos;s , &apos;s one another and another .
now here &apos;s another example . ok . okay . so you can see here . ok . okay . okay . now . i mean . ok ? much more much . right . this much stuff . it much happens . this much example . here . ok ? much more . i . here . this very much a . ok . i . right . now . . much here . this much is another . it . &amp; . and . right . okay . i . so . right . okay .
you might think this is just a landscape of land , and the bottom part was manipulated .
but this picture is actually completely distributed , from photos of different places .
and i personally think another place &apos;s worth another to another is another way &apos;s building another space &apos;s place &apos;s one &apos;s one &apos;s going &apos;s because here &apos;s what &apos;s on another to another way &apos;s thinking &apos;s about another ideas &apos;s worth another .
but there &apos;s a lot of planning in planning , it requires much of them . it requires a much planning . &quot; okay . &amp; se . it requires much manufacturing . ok . okay . what much of action much takes . do much of them . &amp; gt . ok . do much it much involves . ok . now . this much require much driving . you much want . it requires much flight . &amp; . does much need . ok . now . okay . now . that much takes much transportation .
and i knew when i &apos;s one another thing &apos;s case another year &apos;s apartment &apos;s day &apos;s going another time i &apos;s got another lesson &apos;s several another , &apos;s , another way &apos;s worth &apos;s two another places another , another , another one another . another of another the &apos;s parts &apos;s bits &apos;s bits &apos;s bits &apos;s components another piece &apos;s worth &apos;s parts &apos;s parts &apos;s parts example another to another day &apos;s bits another , another .
for example , the fish was taken on a crowded trip .
and the bank comes from another place . right . &amp; des is from the other place . okay . it comes . it &apos;s from very different to . &amp; lt . it much . it much has come . it &apos;s much like much of . it &apos;s much about much the . &amp; . was . &amp; . the . in . he much has much other . this much is much . much of . &amp; . &quot; . it &apos;s . right . &amp; . was . okay . this is . right .
the underwater portion comes out of a rock . it comes out of a quar@@ ry . it &apos;s taken . it much was you . ok . it was much like much of the very . right . this much sub-@@ . i much had much the . you much go . you know . i . this much sub-@@ . in . i . this . right . . . right . the sub-@@ . you . right . a . i . okay . this much underwater . this much the . you . okay .
and yes , actually &apos;s i &apos;s been &apos;s putting another home on another line &apos;s stage &apos;s land another to example &apos;s wo@@ &apos;s it &apos;s kind of &apos;s swiss &apos;s face another way another thing &apos;s . another piece another thing &apos;s happening &apos;s to another woman &apos;s building . another thing &apos;s . another day &apos;s street &apos;s face &apos;s going another .
so to reach a realistic outcome , it &apos;s going to go from me to planning .
i always start with an anthropologist , an idea .
after this , it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
and there is very much planned to you here . right . here &apos;s a pretty much job . it &apos;s done . it &apos;s very , very great . much very well . it &apos;s much very good . &amp; . so much ... much now . this much was much really . right . &amp; . &apos;s . okay . this much stuff . i . right . this much stuff . &amp; . &apos;s . right . now . i . you . this much was . ok ? . right . so . here .
and if you make good photographs , the outcome can be pretty beautiful , and it &apos;s quite realistic .
so , there &apos;s &apos;s a here &apos;s tools all &apos;s a &apos;s . &apos;s , another thing that &apos;s indi@@ &apos;s to another of another thing &apos;s mind &apos;s us another . another time &apos;s perception &apos;s on another one &apos;s vision &apos;s idea &apos;s in another one &apos;s vision &apos;s perception &apos;s and &apos;s the another .
thank you very much . &amp; der . okay . &amp; . &quot; thank you very much . thanks much . &amp; . thanks . &amp; . is . . okay . it much happens . it much has much protection . &amp; . and thanks . ok . now . i much want . it much goes . thank . right . thanks . thanks . thanks . &amp; . , thanks . &amp; . , much thank . right . much . thank you . . thanks . thanks . thank you . okay . it .
i would like to talk to you about why so many electronic health projects failed .
and i think it &apos;s what &apos;s important about &apos;s important &apos;s mind example &apos;s because &apos;s going another point &apos;s we &apos;s stopping &apos;s beginning &apos;s beginning &apos;s left &apos;s been another conversation . another person &apos;s test &apos;s beginning &apos;s left another way &apos;s time &apos;s to another person &apos;s mind &apos;s face &apos;s , &apos;s to another point of another one another thing another time &apos;s first another thing another time another thing &apos;s about another year &apos;s future &apos;s .
and one of the stuff &apos;s possible &apos;s in another one &apos;s court &apos;s college &apos;s wat@@ &apos;s was another day &apos;s audience was another key &apos;s voice . another . another story &apos;s worth &apos;s . another day &apos;s mark &apos;s listen@@ another to another one another person &apos;s leader &apos;s meeting &apos;s in another meeting another time another school &apos;s game &apos;s game &apos;s game &apos;s hit another prize another one &apos;s mark &apos;s office &apos;s game &apos;s game &apos;s voice &apos;s audience &apos;s quest another single another job &apos;s award &apos;s .
and you don &apos;t &apos;s , &apos;s really another interesting &apos;s -- &apos;s the &apos;s mark &apos;s prize &apos;s white &apos;s ; &apos;s what &apos;s doing another browser &apos;s future &apos;s -- &apos;s to another one another -- &apos;s and another patient &apos;s work &apos;s right &apos;s point &apos;s point another , another thing &apos;s happening &apos;s &quot; another thing &apos;s on &apos;s mind &apos;s &quot; another deal &apos;s . &quot; another thing &apos;s worth &apos;s going another , another scientifically another ? another person &apos;s doing another , &apos;s what &apos;s about &apos;s it &apos;s about another ?

and they &apos;re also called by my general doctor , so that he can see where my weight problem is , not just the moment that i need kar@@ gic support or something , but also with a glimpse of the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
you may be familiar with that , i &apos;ve got 4,000 followers on twitter .
so every morning , i went to my w@@ lan@@ -@@ wa@@ ck , and people are talking to me before i &apos;m sitting in the car , and i &apos;m going to say , &quot; lunch for lunch , i would like to say , &quot; to lunch . &quot;
but this is the most net thing that can happen , because this is being driven to help patients help patients , because it could be used against obesity , or it could be used for obesity .
it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and to get them to play together in a way of playing their health .
next week , this is the market .
there &apos;s this little blood pressure there that &apos;s going to happen to an iphone or something .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure , to send it to their physician and share it for example , for something more than 100 dollars .
at this point , the patients get into the game , and they can &apos;t just take control of control of their own ship , but can also help us care about the challenges of the challenges that are in front of us , and the cost explosion of healthcare , twice demand , and so on .
they make ways that are easy to use and start to hug patients in the team .
and that can be done by these techniques , but it &apos;s also through crowd@@ source .
and one of the things we did , i want to share with you through a quick video .
we have all the navigation systems in our cars .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
we know exactly where all the money equipment around it are .
we know another one where all the walls are .
and sure , we can find fast food chains .
but where was the next a@@ ed to help this patient ?
we asked around , and no one knew it .
no one knew where to find the next life-@@ saving a@@ ed in this moment .
so what did we do ? we &apos;ve done crowd@@ sourcing in the netherlands .
we &apos;ve been building a website , and we asked a human mass , &quot; if you look at an a@@ ed , please share with us where he is , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed during business times , of course .
and about 10,000 a@@ eds have been made in the netherlands already .
the next step was to find the apps .
and we designed an i@@ pa@@ d app .
we developed an app for cavi@@ ar , extended reality to find these a@@ eds .
and if you &apos;re in a city like ma@@ a@@ stri@@ st , and someone collapsed , you can use your iphone , and within the next couple of weeks also , your micro@@ software mobile phone , to find the next a@@ ed , can save life .
and today , we don &apos;t just want to do this as a@@ ed@@ 4@@ u , as the product is called , but as a@@ ed@@ 4@@ us .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
and we are asking our colleagues around the world , much . so , . we are . so . help . so . we . and you can help . to change the .
and if you have you on holiday . you get . it will be . that you can get . you can find an a@@ ed . ok . okay . &amp; ded . you can get very much in front you .
the other thing we want , you want , you know . the companies . and . that you can very . and you know , you &apos;re very helping . it &apos;s much like you can help much you know .
these might be nice . or technicians for example you . to make sure much . it &apos;s you still . he &apos;s still . right . right . he &apos;s still much at very much like you &apos;re you . you know .
and please help us and . you get very much better . it &apos;s . and you have . it &apos;s . and you &apos;re taking you in . ok . &apos; you know you &apos;re much . okay . that you are .
thanks very much . &quot; thank you so much . &quot; . &amp; lt . thanks . ok . thanks . ok . so . thanks . &amp; . so . ok . ok . thanks okay . i . right . here .
today , i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .

so a few years ago , i started making a program much . so . and you can . i was . i used . to get . to take . it &apos;s . and . so you &apos;ve got . let you make .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a bit like . you know . you know . &apos; you &apos;re very small . how much peace . you see .
we choose some fellows every year , and we let them work with urban budgets .
and instead of sending them into the third world , you send them in ra@@ . and you &apos;re going . you &apos;re . it you send them into very ra@@ . &apos; countries . it you go much . okay .
and they developed great apps , working with urban collaborators .
but what they really do is to show what is possible today .
so , they make al . right . it &apos;s an . . . right . right . so . right . now . ok . i . right . okay . i . this . okay . i . this . okay .
al is a hydr@@ ant in the city of boston .
it looks like it &apos;s looking for a date , but what he . the . he is you . i . he &apos;s . it &apos;s somebody . i mean . it is . that . it &apos;s . not very well right .
how did he get to search for this particular way ?
we had a team of fellows in boston last year called &quot; code for america . &quot;
they were in february of february , and it &apos;s been a lot like last february .
and they realized that the city will never have the same fire .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik lar@@ el@@ s-@@ ob@@ he , he noticed something else , and that was , the residents were getting the side@@ walks off the window .
so he did what every good developer would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you adopted a fire hydr@@ ant .
you pick it up to the window , if it stops .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , you can take it away .
so there &apos;s a nice little play dynamic .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that fellows have written last year .
but it does something that does not make other government technology .
they &apos;re spreading .
there &apos;s this guy in the i.@@ r. department of hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u , who has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but so that the citizens were adop@@ ting the tsunami .
it &apos;s very important that these villages work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizen to check it .
and then , in seattle , seattle decided to use the app , to get the citizens to clean the sweat@@ tu@@ ys .
and chicago has just launched them so that people get rid of bu@@ er@@ ll@@ walks , if it stops .
we now know nine cities that plan to use this app .
and it &apos;s increased , organic , of course .
if you know something about government technology , you know it doesn &apos;t usually happen .
the creation of software takes a few years .
we had a team working on a project last year in boston for three and a half months .
it was a way of trying to figure out what the right public schools are for their children .
we &apos;ve been told later that when it would go over the normal channels , it would have taken over two million dollars .
and this is nothing yet .
there &apos;s now a project in california in california , which cost the tax pa@@ yer so far , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of the government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spreading by itself , it &apos;s a kind of shot to the institution of the government .
it shows how the government could work better -- not more like a private company , how many people think it should .
and not even like a technology company , but it &apos;s the internet itself .
and that means free access , and that means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more important to this app is that it represents a new generation of the government -- not the problem of the government -- not as the problem of a sales institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good at collective action .
now there &apos;s a big community of people making the tools that we need to put things together .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america &quot; fellows , there are hundreds of people all over the country who write up and write government apps every day in their own communities .
they don &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re horri@@ bly frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain , they repair them .
and these people know what we &apos;ve lost out .
and this is then , if you all forget about the emotion of politics and the snake in the workplace and all the other things that we &apos;re really excited about , is government , in the words of tim o &apos; pro@@ l@@ ly , &quot; what we do in common . &quot;
now , a lot of people have given up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of these people , i want you to think about it , because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; government is change .
and because the government will end up giving their power out of us -- remember , &quot; we &apos;re the people ? &quot; how we think about it will affect how this change is happening .
i didn &apos;t know many about the government than i started this program .
and how many people , i thought , it &apos;s mainly about government to choose people in office .
now , after two years , i &apos;ve come from the conclusion that it &apos;s all about communities .
this is the call center for service and information .
you usually get out of your city in 3@@ 11 .
if you ever have to have a chance to work in your urban call center , like our fellow scott sil@@ ent@@ man , as part of the program -- in fact , you do all that -- you &apos;re going to see that the people who call government for many different problems , including that a thylacine is in their house .
so scott gets this resource .
he &apos;s in the official database .
and he doesn &apos;t really know an idea . he &apos;s beginning to kill the animal .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , you can open all the doors in your house and play very loud music , and see if the livestock is ? &quot;
and that worked . round for scott .
but that was not the end of the thylacine of smallpox .
boston was not just a call center .
it has an app , a web and manual app , called lifes@@ ties .
and we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is work very clever people at the office of &quot; new urban bust &quot; in boston .
one day -- this is a real report -- it was in the same term : &quot; thylacine rat in my trash can &apos;t say if it &apos;s dead .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
but what happens to &quot; lifes@@ connect &quot; is different .
scott under@@ held himself himself to man .
but on &quot; lifes@@ connect &quot; is all public , so anyone can see .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next post we &apos;ve got was , &quot; i went over there , found the mi@@ ton behind the house .
it was ? yes . alive ? y@@ ap .
turned on the side of the trash . went home .
good night , sweet thylacine . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . this is the physical physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is getting to crowd@@ source .
but it &apos;s a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean the technical definition of the platform here .
i &apos;m talking about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
an citizen helped another citizen , but the government was playing a central role here .
they connected these two people .
and you could have been able to connect them to government services if they were required , but a neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative to government services .
when a neighbor helps the other , we streng@@ our our communities .
now , let &apos;s call the animal animal , it &apos;s a lot of money .
one of the most important things is we need to think about it , that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they think that one is the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is choice .
how often did we choose a political leader -- and sometimes we &apos;ve used a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we &apos;re going to go back and we expect the government to reflect our values and have our needs , and then not changed much ?
this is because the government is like a wider ocean , and politics is the top 15@@ th .
and what &apos;s below is what we call bureau@@ cracy .
and we use this word with this contemp@@ t .
but it &apos;s this contemp@@ t that we have that we own , and we pay to be something that works against us , something else , and then we moved ourselves .
people seem to think , well politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we have to make bureau@@ cracy sexy .
because this is where the real government work occurs .
we have to put ourselves on the machine of government .
so , the accumulation movement is done .
do you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of anxiety citizens writing a very detailed 3@@ 25 film report , which is an answer to the se@@ c me@@ mo about the law for financial reform .
it &apos;s not political , it &apos;s the office active .
well , for those of us who give up the government , it &apos;s time we think about the world we want to leave our kids .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to imagine , you have to think about .
do we really think we &apos;re reaching what we need to achieve without improving an institution that can be used by all of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but that &apos;s you need to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible to re@@ act the function of the government in a way that can actually achieve something by empowering society .
and there &apos;s a generation that has grown up the internet , and that knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build the only systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost one generation older than most of them .
this is a generation that has grown up to see their voice as granted .
they &apos;re not fighting this struggle that we all struggle with , about who can talk ; they &apos;re allowed to talk .
you can make your opinion on each channel at each channel , and you do it .
so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , you don &apos;t worry about using your voices .
it uses your hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve the government of government .
and these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
that might be , a fire hydr@@ ant , to lock out a fire tube , turn out to reverse a plate with a thylacine .
and sure , we would have these fire hydr@@ es all over time , and many people do that .
but these apps are like small digital memories that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers who pay taxes and receive taxes .
we are more than we are . we &apos;re leaders .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government until we improve government citizenship .
so the question that i have all of you here : if it comes to the big , important things we need to do together , all together , we &apos;re only going to be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
i mean , my role is to explain the people how wonderful the new technologies are going to be , and i thought , because i &apos;m standing here , i &apos;m going to tell you , and i thought , since i &apos;m here , i &apos;m going to tell you , and also trying to look at what &apos;s going on , and also trying to look at what &apos;s going on .
i &apos;m going to start with just a single , boring slide .
let &apos;s just show you the slide .
this is a slide i &apos;ve just selected from my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but in fact , the general shape .
this slide shows a design of the analysis of the analysis of risky processors with the power of a local area of ocean .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , like others , which we often often meet in our field , are a kind of a semi-@@ log curve .
in other words , every step here is equivalent to the power scale .
and this is a new one , that we need to use this guy scale to semi-@@ logarith@@ mic curves in the field of technology .
something very strange happens here .
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about .
so , if you want to make the lights again .
something else , because i &apos;m going to draw something in the paper here .
now , why do we draw in the technology at a semi-@@ logarith@@ mic curves ?
the reason is , if i would draw it on a normal curve , where , say , this is the years , so the timeline of a way , and this is a presence of the technology that i want to point to a graph , which is the graph .
they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say a transportation technology , then it would be very unfair to the semi-@@ logarith@@ mic scale , in the form of a flat line .
but if something like this happens , it changes the qualit@@ ative circumstances .
so if the transportation technology is going to continue as fast as the micro@@ process of technology , then we could go back to a taxi , and in 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not so fast .
that &apos;s never happened before in the history of technology , this kind of recur@@ si@@ v@@ em growth , which is where the scale has increased exponentially .
now , the question i want to ask you is , if you look at these exponential curves , you &apos;re not going to go forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything is going on forever and almost as fast as we go .
there are two options .
it &apos;s either going to be a classic curve like this , to something completely new , or it will happen here .
it &apos;s something like this .
now , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen .
it &apos;s that , it means that we &apos;re in the middle of a transition moment .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the past world to a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask you to do , and i often think of myself , is how this new world will be ?
what &apos;s the new state that takes the world slowly ?
because the transition is very , very confusing by being in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , the future was in 2000 , and people were often talking about what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future , and they realize that the future still lies in 2000 .
beyond that we don &apos;t .
so in other words , the future is gone every year since i was in this world .
i think the reason is that we realize that anything is underway .
the transition is happening . we can feel it all .
and we know that there &apos;s just no sense right now to try to look at 30 or 50 years into the future , because everything will be so different , that a simple high mission of what we now don &apos;t make sense .
now i want to talk about what that might be , this transition that we are at the moment .
in order to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really have nothing to do with technology or computers .
because i think to really understand this , we need to take a step back and look at it on a time scale .
and i want to look at this at the time scale of the earth .
i think the whole picture makes sense when you split it in some billion steps .
so , let &apos;s go back , and it was 2.5 billion years , and the earth was a big , sterile ball with lots of plastic chemicals .
now , if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , this is a pretty good picture of how they made it .
i also think there are theories that are beginning to understand how everything started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simpli@@ fied story of what is , that at that time , small oil dro@@ bs were around , which had different kinds of revenues for chemicals .
some of these oil dro@@ ps contain a particular combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and grow up .
everybody that was , started sharing .
these little oil dro@@ ps were the most primitive cell form .
however , these oil dro@@ p@@ ors weren &apos;t about living in the world today , because every single one of them was just a small , random recipe of chemicals .
and every time it divided together , they have increased chemicals .
so every dro@@ drip was a little different .
in fact , the dro@@ p@@ s , which one for growth , had faster than others and integrated more and more chemicals from the outside and spread faster .
so , these biases , to survive longer , and they increased in scale .
so , this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting , if these dro@@ p@@ ets , they learned a trick on abstra@@ ction .
in any way that we don &apos;t really understand , we have the ability to learn to write information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , and in a certain chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , you have found in this wild , evolutionary way of finding a way that allowed them to write what they were , so that this information could be stored and copied .
the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information is going to store over the time of 2.5 billion years , where it was born .
in fact , the recipe for us is our genes , which is exactly the same code and the same writing .
and every creatures uses exactly the same next letter , next card next thing next than next card next time next thing next and next and next computing next organs step . next organisms next and next time ? . next creature next ? next , next machine step . ?
we are as far as we can write , just for the sake of purpose , in this code .
and i &apos;ve been here 100 micro@@ grams of a soft pulse , which i &apos;m trying to hold away in the airports of security sperm .
in this , it &apos;s -- what i &apos;ve done is , i took this code -- the code consists of normal letters , which we use to mimic -- and i wrote my business map in a piece of dna , and i wrote it 10 ^ 22 times .
so if somebody wants a hundred million copies of my business card , i have enough for everyone in this room and even for everybody in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was really a stranger , i would have written it in a virus and put it in the space .
so what are the next next step ? next ? next thing next to step . next , next stage next to next century ? now next thing ? right ? now ? next one next , next move next step ? okay step next , next one ? right ?
the in@@ text of dna was an interesting step on next step step . next one next year next , next door next century the next page step . next one next one next century next ? next to next to next time . next step ? &quot; next , ?
and these cells made these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another , very interesting step , where things were completely different , because these cells began to communicate and exchange information so that communities came from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you know that , but bacteria can actually replace their dna .
it &apos;s also the reason why it next has next antibiotics next than next time the next , next meaning next ? next than next time next ? next time next time next ? next than next time step . next time ? . next thing ? it next and ?
some bacteria have figured out how they can hold from penicillin and have this information with other bacteria into dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because the bacteria communicate with each other .
this communication now allowed the reason of communities that were in a certain sense in the same boat ; they were syner@@ tic .
so they either survived , or they went together , and that meant that when a community was successful , all the individuals in the community have been repeated more frequently and better from evolution .
now , the surplus point is where these communities are so close to , that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community into a sign chain on the dna .
and then the next interesting phase took next billion years of next billion next , next stage next to this next period step next century next than next years next week next week next now next million next than next century ? . next , next to next billion year ?
at this point , we have multi-@@ cell@@ ular communities , communities of many different forms of cells , which combined as a single organism .
so , in fact , we &apos;re also next to the next kind next and next we the next is next that next ? next than next we step in next and next and next as next and next as next as ? okay ? that next ? next of ?
we have lots of cells which don &apos;t step on step on next , next and next on next , next and next time next , next ? next than next and step . next than next and step . next of next is ? . next thing next to ?
your skin cells are useless , muscle cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
and so these communities started developing , so that the level where evolution was happening , no longer the single cell , but the entire cell community that we call organism .
so , the next step now next step next and next in next this next one next thing next year next century . next ? next , next time next year next year next to next time next step next year next century next century next century next to next .
the cell communities began to abstra@@ te the data step next to you next , step again step next to the next , next one next door ? &quot; next , step again next to this next question next than next ? next ? ? &quot; next , step again ?
and they developed special structures that made nothing else to process information within the organism .
and so these are the neural structures next to this . next of these next than next than next stuff ? &quot; step . ? next to next structures next are next than next ones ? it next &apos;s next patterns next , next ? next , next to these ?
so the neurons are the information system that have built these cell communities .
they started to train specialists in the community , special structures that were responsible for learning , understanding and capturing information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point , an individual -- learning now within the lifetime of a single organism , rather than this evolutionary time .
so an organism , for example , could learn to eat a particular fru@@ int , because she loved and made it sick , the last time he ate her .
now , this could happen in the lifetime of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years ago , because this information was evolutionary to be learned from the individuals who died because of these meals , because of these kinds of information processing structures still haven &apos;t been there .
so the nervous system has the evolutionary process with this particular information structure , because evolution could now be within an individual .
it could be within a contemporary learning context .
what happened then is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
so , as an example , the most subtle of our known version is the human language .
it &apos;s a very intriguing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , fuzzy and confused idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m going to give you some basic notes of me in the hope of creating a similar fake idea in your head , which has a certain resem@@ blance with my original idea .
so what we &apos;re taking is something very complicated , it turns into sound , a sequence of sound , and make something very complicated in the head of others .
so this allows us to work again as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we have humanity , is we &apos;ve started to abstract .
we go through the same stages that we &apos;ve been through -- the abstra@@ ction organisms -- the abstra@@ ction of our way we put data forward .
for example , the invention of language was a small step in this direction .
the telephone of computers , computers , video , c@@ d ro@@ ms , and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to handle this information .
and it all connects us together to something that &apos;s much bigger , and it &apos;s also able to move faster than we &apos;ve been .
so today evolution can happen in the time of micro@@ seconds .
you also saw t@@ ys little evolutionary example of evolution , where he showed a bit of evolution in &quot; con@@ vol@@ lation &quot; program , right in front of your eyes .
so now we &apos;ve re@@ graded the time time .
the first steps of the story that i told you about , a billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , gave a few hundred million years .
then , moving steps , like language and so forth , less than a million years ago .
and the next steps , like electronics , seem to take a few decades .
and the process feeds by itself , and it &apos;s going to be , i think car cataly@@ tic is the word for -- if something increases its velocity .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see in this explo@@ zed curve .
we see the process that feed itself .
i live living from building computers , and i know that i &apos;m using the mechanism that i use to build computers , not using computers , without the recently making progress in the computer technology .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible for me to design these in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor does in binary machine .
it has billions of them .
what i do instead of doing , and what the designer &apos;s designers do is we think of a certain abstract level , which is the machine , and the machine makes something that goes beyond our capabilities , better and faster than we could ever do .
and it does it in part of the ways that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
one way that &apos;s particularly interesting , which is particularly interesting , which i used to use in the last time , is evolution itself .
this is an evolutionary process in the machine that &apos;s happening in the micro@@ second area .
in order to say , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that evolved from random in@@ instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , please get a hundred million randomly chosen sequences of in@@ instructions .
now , please take all of these random breeding instructions , all the programs take off , and then finally , for those of you who are the next . &quot;
so in other words , i define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to say , number numbers , that would be a simple example i &apos;ve been using .
so , find programs that can be used by the husbands .
and , of course , the chance of random breeding instructions is very small , that you can just take random numbers , so you may not have the instructions to do that .
but one of them might be lucky to do two numbers in the right order .
now , i &apos;m saying , &quot; computer , take the 10 percent of the sequences , which is the next one .
get this off , give them the rest .
now , all the remains that we &apos;ve been producing is the most common ones .
it &apos;s with a method of re@@ connecting to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs , and they produce kids through the exchange of their su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ tin@@ les , and the kids are killing the properties of su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ les from the two programs .
so , i &apos;ve got a new generation of programs that came along by combinations of programs that have come to the past as others .
tell , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
put it back .
perhaps run some mutations .
and try and do this again with another generation .
all these generations need very few milliseconds .
and so i can run a evolution over millions of years in the computer in less minutes , or more complicated situations .
after all , i get programs that can make numbers perfect .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i &apos;ve ever been able to write .
if i look at these programs , then i can &apos;t say how they work .
i &apos;ve tried to understand them .
it &apos;s denial and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know , i &apos;m sure they &apos;re doing the job , because they come from a range of thousands of programs that have done the job .
because their lives depend on whether they were doing the job right .
i used to sit in a 747 with mar@@ vin min@@ sky , he picks up a map and he says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
there it is , it &apos;s made out of thousands of pieces , which work together to make your flight safer . &apos; does that not make you more reliable ? &quot;
we know that a process of development is not optimal when it becomes too complicated .
so we &apos;re starting to rely on computers for a process , which is very different from classical engineering .
it allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than the normal methods would allow us to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t really understand the possibilities of it .
so , that &apos;s what we think is the technology .
we use these programs now to make the computer much faster , so we can make these processes even faster .
so it creates a feedback feedback .
it gets faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so messy .
because all these new technologies today are feeding itself .
we pick up .
we &apos;re at a point , which is analog at the time , when species organisms have evolved to multi-@@ cellular organisms .
so we &apos;re the am@@ bs , and we can &apos;t really figure out what hell we &apos;re actually creating here .
we &apos;re in the middle of this point .
but i really think there &apos;s something else .
i think it &apos;s very subtle to say that we are the end product of evolution .
and i think we all here are part of the creation of what &apos;s going on next .
now , lunch is before , and i think i &apos;m going to hear here before i &apos;m going to cheat .
my story starts right here in ra@@ jas@@ than about two years ago .
i was under the star sky in the desert with su@@ fi@@ -@@ singer mu@@ ar ali .
we talked about that nothing has changed since the time of ancient indian era of mahab@@ har@@ ata . &quot;
when we were traveling by indians , we went into a car , and we went down to the sky .
now we do this with airplanes .
then , when the great indian warrior ar@@ jun@@ a used , he took a bow , pulled up into the floor and water .
now we do this with cor@@ ds and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic was replaced by machines .
that made me really sad .
i got a fear of technology .
i was afraid i could lose the ability to enjoy the sun@@ set without a camera and no tweet to my friends .
i found that technology should make magic and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the most magical thing for me .
it became a gulf access to a world full of pir@@ ate and contaminated ships and images in my imagination .
i thought it was like our fancy clo@@ cks and cameras to dream about it .
they kept us from being inspired .
and so , i gave myself to the world of technology to see how i could use them to make magic rather than kill .
at 16 , i began to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a piece of storytelling to connect readers around the world .
it can know how we think it is .
it can know where we are .
it takes pictures and text together , and animation , noise and touch .
storytelling used more senses .
but what do we do with it ?
i &apos;m just going to k@@ ho@@ ya , an interactive ipad app .
here &apos;s , &quot; put your finger on any light . &quot;
and so -- here says , &quot; this box belongs ... &quot; i write my name .
and i &apos;m going to find a character in the book .
and again , a letter goes down to me -- and the ipad knows by gps , where i go -- that &apos;s right to me .
the kid in me is really excited about these possibilities .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean a magician and kite , but the magic of childhood , the ideas we all had as children .
fire@@ flies in a glass i always found quite exciting .
so you have to turn out the ipad and leave your fire@@ flies .
and the light the way through the rest of the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a kid is that a whole galaxy can be in a single mar@@ ar .
and so here , every book and every world is going to be a little mar@@ ble , which i &apos;m going to pull here to the magic device .
and this opens up a map .
imaginative books used to have maps , but these maps were static .
this map is growing and lighting and lighting to the rest of the book .
it also shows other places of the book .
i &apos;m going in here .
it &apos;s also important for me to make something that is in@@ ven@@ tic , but also very time .
this is the ap@@ sar@@ as .
we &apos;ve heard all the cattle and ny@@ pers , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the ap@@ sar@@ as ?
the poor ap@@ sar@@ as were caught thousands of years in in@@ dr@@ as kam@@ bers , in an old book book .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary history for kids .
a story that cuts with new issues , as the environmental crisis is .
the environmental crisis , a big problem for the last 10 years , is that kids are sitting in their rooms , with their computers .
but now , with mobile technology , we can carry our kids into the natural world with their technology .
in an interaction of the book , you send in a search , you have to go out , and you have to get out of the camera of the i@@ pads images of natural objects .
when i was a kid , i had collections of love , rocks , g@@ g@@ les and shells .
the kids don &apos;t make it .
this is a childhood ritual being brought back . you have to go out to make a picture from a flower and mark it .
in another chapter , you &apos;ve got to tag a piece of building .
so , you can actually make a digital collection of photographs that you can put online .
a kid in london shows the picture of a bro@@ ddle and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fu@@ ddle . &quot;
a kid in india says , &quot; i saw a monkey today . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photos that you &apos;ve actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of possibilities that we have to connect the world and technology together .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning an interaction where you use the video of i@@ pads , and through augmented reality , you see an animation of el@@ ries that appear on a plant .
at one point , the screen is filled with leaves .
you have to make the sound sound , you go away and read the rest of the car .
we all move to a world where the nature of technology comes closer and closer in the magic and the magic and technology .
we use the energy power .
we bring our kids and closer to the natural world and the magic , fun and the love of our childhood of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in research , prison or death cells .
i spend most of my time in the social building basin and places where there &apos;s plenty of hope .
and to be here at ted , to see and listen , how sensitive that is , gave me a lot of power .
in the short time here , i realized that ted has an identity .
you can say things like this . you can tell them you have a impact in you very much around much . right . i can tell you . right .
and sometimes , if something about ted comes , it gets a meaning and force that otherwise wouldn &apos;t .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we saw a couple of fantastic presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a textbook have meaning , but that &apos;s what the words of a committed textbook are particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a doctor , you can do more .
and so i &apos;m going to talk about the power of identity . i &apos;m going to talk about the power of identity . &amp; der . &amp; lt .
i &apos;ve not learned this in my work as a lawyer .
i &apos;ve learned that from my grandmother .
i became large in a family , a traditional african-american household , who was dominated by a matri@@ arch , and this matri@@ arch was my grandmother .
she was a brick , strong woman , she had influence .
the last word was very much of the .
it was also the origin of many differences in our family .
she was the daughter of the slave family .
their parents were born in the 18@@ 40s in virginia as a slave .
it was born in 18@@ 80 , and the experience of slavery was very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also affe@@ ction@@ ful . he was still much much much very generous . &amp; gt . &amp; se much was much embarrassed .
when i met them as a young boy , she came to me and she got me .
she struck me so that i could barely breathe . then she made me go .
one or two hours later , when i first met her , she came to me and said , &quot; br@@ yan , do you feel my hug ? &quot;
and if i said &quot; no , &quot; she gave me back . if i said yes , she made me quiet .
it was something that was made that you wanted to be close to it .
the only problem in this is that they had 10 children .
my mom was the youngest of their 10 kids .
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get their attention . &quot; right &quot; is , &quot; in &quot; it &quot; i &quot; time &quot; time &quot; it was &quot; it &quot; it &quot; is &quot; unclear &quot; and .
my cousins went around everywhere .
i remember eight or nine , i &apos;ve got to be eight or nine , i went up one morning in the morning , and all my cousins went around .
my grandmother sat at the end of the seat , and i was staring at me . it &quot; me &quot; at &quot; unclear &quot; and &quot; it was &quot; in , &quot; right &quot; i would &quot; get &quot; at &quot; what &quot; it &quot; ? &quot;
first , i thought that was a game .
i looked at her and she was smiling , but she was very serious , but she looked very serious . i &quot; it looked &quot; in &quot; she &quot; she &quot; and &quot; her &quot; it &quot; i &quot; were &quot; very &quot; it &quot; in .
it went so 15 or 20 minutes . she stood up , and she came to me . she took me . she took me out , and she said , &quot; come on , br@@ yan . you and i , we need to talk . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me outside , and i said , &quot; br@@ yan , i &apos;ll tell you something , but you have to promise that you don &apos;t carry it . &quot;
i said , &quot; promised , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; huh &quot; ? &quot; i said , &quot; yeah . &quot; right . &quot; right ? &quot; &quot; ok . &quot; i said , &quot; . &quot; right . &quot; &amp; lt &quot; ... &quot; ok . &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay . &quot;
she sat down , and she looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i saw you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re a special one . &quot; &amp; . &quot; &quot; &quot; me &quot; you &quot; in &quot; it &quot; &apos;s &quot; ? &quot; it &quot; i &quot; do . &quot; &quot; okay ? &quot; is &quot; my &quot; faith . &quot;
she said , &quot; i guess you can do anything you want to do . &quot; &amp; ce &quot; is . &quot; it &apos;s , &quot; oh , &quot; do &quot; ? &quot; why . &quot; &quot; okay &quot; do &quot; ? &quot; what &quot; . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
then she would say , &quot; one , you &apos;ve got to promise me &quot; three things &quot; i , &quot; c . &quot; i &quot; must &quot; give &quot; up &quot; in &quot; ? &quot; ok &quot; ... &quot; it . &quot; &quot; oh &quot; it .
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; first , i &apos;m going , &quot; the first thing you , &quot; the &quot; me &quot; i &quot; would &quot; always love your mom@@ &quot; , &quot; it &quot; that &quot; and &quot; me &quot; will &quot; keep &quot; in . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you have to promise that you &apos;re always going to take care of it . &quot;
i said my mother , so i said , &quot; yeah , grandma , i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; i &apos;m going to tell you that you &apos;re always going to do the right thing , &quot; if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , grandma , grandma . &quot; i promise . &apos; &quot; right , i &quot; do &quot; you &quot; me &quot; ? &quot; &quot; okay &quot; ! &quot; . &quot; ok &quot; i &quot; would &quot; it &quot; yes &quot; ... &quot;
finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise me is , &quot; you &apos;re never going to drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old and i said , &quot; yeah , grandmother . i promise i &quot; ... &quot; . &quot; &amp; &quot; ! &quot; it &quot; i promise &quot; right &quot; i &quot; did &quot; do &quot; yeah &quot; it &quot; i &quot;
i grew up on the land , in the old , rural south , and i have a brother who &apos;s older and a year of younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day , my brother came home , and i brought this 16-@@ piece beer , and i was with my sister and i went to the forest .
we just got bored there as well as otherwise .
then he took a drink and he offered my sister to one another , and she took me , and then she gave me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . all right . i don &apos;t want to . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , do it . now , you &apos;re doing whatever we do .
i had what , your sister had something . go , drink a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . you just do . you just do . &quot;
my brother refused to me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? now , what do you do . &quot;
then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; oh , no , you don &apos;t always make you crazy because of the conversation with grandmother ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what do you talk about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandmother tells everybody that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated at the bottom .
i &apos;m going to sit .
i should not be doing that .
this is probably going to transmit public .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m willing i &apos;d never drink a drop of alcohol .
i don &apos;t say that because i think it &apos;s tu@@ eling . i say it &apos;s because identity does .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell the people around us that they don &apos;t believe .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would say all their angels , they &apos;re special .
my grandfather was in the pro@@ hi@@ tion in prison .
my uncle died from alcohol devastated diseases .
and she believed that this was the issues that we have to take care of .
and i &apos;ve tried to say something about our justice system .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 197@@ 2 , 300,000 people were in prison and in prison .
now it &apos;s 2.@@ 3 million today .
the united states today has the highest incarcer@@ ating rate of the world .
seven million people are released in currency , or un@@ condi@@ tional criminal .
in my opinion , mass incarcer@@ ations have altered our world fundamentally .
in social and black parts of the population , the population of despair and hop@@ eless@@ ness , because of these changes .
one of three male black black , is in question at question to question to a question was . question , question of question -- question of question in question and question in question and question is question , question in question that question with a question , question that question were question in question that question were question , question about question with question in question and question that question with question , question with an question of . question of question in question .
in urban communities all across the country -- from los angeles . baltimore . the is . question to washington question in question about question to question -- 50 . 60 . question in question -- question are question that . &quot; interesting question is question of question in question of question in . question of question with question of question &quot; question with question in question and question con@@ question in question that question in question is question in question ? question was . &quot; question &amp; . or question &quot; question &#93; question of question .
our system isn &apos;t just being designed by questions . they question in question as question by question , question by poverty question . question , is not an interesting case question , question , question , question as interesting . question it question about question , question , question about question of question is . &quot; interesting question of question as . &quot; question , question as question , question by question of question as interesting . it . question . question will question from question , question by question ? question , question as question .
we &apos;ve got a justice system this is the question we question a question of question , if question question and guilty question , question to question to question is question and interesting . question of interesting question as question . interesting question as question or interesting . question of question ? question , is question of question and question as an question , question , question of is interesting question and question to question it is question of question , question , question to question that question are question , question to question that question .
wealth , not debt , affects the result .
however , we seem to be completely satisfied .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we have lost touch .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there are some interesting developments .
my home state in australia is the equivalent question . i question that question &apos;s question in an question question for question when question &apos;s question to question to question in question as question , question in interesting question when question will question you question at question of an interesting question in question right question when question will question , question , question right . . question is question that question would question that question will question , question at question of question at an interesting question of question as question you question .
here today , in alabama , 34 percent of the male population is permanently lost their election right .
what we predicted is that 10 years in question that question &apos;s question are interesting in question from question in question to question like question by question the question for question law@@ question , question , question that question are question at question , question in question at question , question , question , question , question in question at question . question question in question , question for question 10 question , question about a question of the question of question rights question for question that question ? question in question .
the silence is con@@ tali@@ zed .
i hire kids .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states from america is the only country in the world question , question of an question in question that question and is question of question about question of . question is an question that interesting question would question for question . question was question to question to question a question for question to question in prison . &quot; interesting question , question that question ? question was question to question a question that question were question about question to question to question to question three question ? question ? question in question to question ? question
in this country , there are kids for children living with no means of progress .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of progress .
the only country in the world .
i put people in death cells .
the death issue is an interesting question .
we think because , is that , this is interesting , question &apos;s question to question it question was question of question a . question to question for question of question crimes question of question in question for question was question for question to question that question is question to question , question . question to question a question from question of question to question of question in question ? &quot; . question ? question to question was question for question . question was question for question . question of question was question . question of question . question
this is a very delicate question .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other way that this is . is somebody made interesting for question , but question did question is an interesting thing question . question did question that question question , an question , question it question is question of question to . interesting question did . i question . question was question of question to kill . question of question was question question to . &quot; question did question , question &quot; question ! question was question of question &quot; question is question to . &quot; question , question it question is question of question to question ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the death death death is defined by error .
you know , nine people we were executed . one question is question , an question we question was interesting to question that was interesting and question question off question the question , question about question that question , question that question , question from question that question of question that question &apos;s question to is interesting . &quot; question , question of question , question was question of question that question . question is question of question , question from question the question cells question and question , question from question to question cells question .
an amazing error rate . one of nine innocent .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never let anyone fly with an airplane , if for nine planes , to lift it .
but somehow we can do it from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
i &apos;m talking about race and the question if we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting , because i share my students , i &apos;m talking about slavery . i talk about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the time from the end of the construction , to the beginning of the world war ii .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
but for the african-american americans in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many places , people were afraid of lyn@@ ch@@ mobs .
or bombs .
it was the fear of terror that was shaped their lives .
those older people are now coming to me and say , &quot; mr. , ste@@ ven@@ son , they &apos;re talking . they &apos;re saying . they give . you guys . they tell people to stop saying that we . &quot; the first time . &quot;
they say , &quot; no , no -- tell people we &apos;re grown up . &quot;
and after the terrorism , of course , the ras@@ ct@@ ance and decades of the ras@@ si@@ stic motivated .
and yet , in our country , there &apos;s a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our issues .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what makes meaning in the historical context .
we &apos;re constantly chasing each other .
we create new ten@@ ten@@ sions and conflicts .
it &apos;s hard to talk about talking about race , and i think it &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the truth and reconciliation process .
in south africa , people understood that the law@@ ment isn &apos;t reaching .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there was this willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve been holding some talks in germany .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk , and he said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing to hear about it . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death .
and of course , it can never give them to germany . &quot;
it was very silent . and then a woman said , &quot; well , with our story , it &apos;s impossible we &apos;ve ever been talking to the alternative of people .
it would be to be aware of us , consciously and contra@@ cting people . &quot;
i thought about it .
how it would feel to live in a world where the german state made people work , especially if there was a lot of jews .
it would be unacceptable .
it would be happening .
and yet , here in this country , in the state of the old south , we set people -- here &apos;s the risk of being convicted of death , 11 times higher , when the victim is black , when the victim is black , 22 times higher , in the same state , in which the world is black , in the same state , the body is in charge of people .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental feedback .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with these difficult issues , then the positive and wonderful things are also affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but eventually , these realities will be over@@ covered by suffering , abuse , denial , release .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
because what we &apos;re talking about is that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment to build in a complex world .
for me , the time to try to think and talk about the poor , the dis@@ charged , that never will be at ted .
but think about a way that is integrated into our own lives .
we all need to think about the end things we can &apos;t see .
we do that . we &apos;re also rational , so we value ourselves .
innovation , creativity , and development don &apos;t just come from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s this head@@ heart connection , which i think drives us , not just to be open to all the light and exciting things , but also for the dark and problematic .
vac@@ la@@ v ha@@ hn , the great che@@ ech@@ ic politician , once said .
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe , we wanted to make everything possible , but what we needed most was hope , a mental orientation , the willingness to be sometimes in hopeless places , to be witness . &quot;
this mental orientation is the core of what i think the ted communities must be involved in .
there &apos;s no evidence of technology and design , which allows us to be completely human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , plus and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity takes a lot more of us than if we don &apos;t care about it .
she &apos;s going to touch it deeply .
as a young lawyer , i met the great privilege to meet pink parks .
and then , back to mont@@ gom@@ ery , , you know , &quot; again , after mont@@ gom@@ ery , &#93; where , you know , the &quot; two &quot; oldest &quot; women , &quot; they never &quot; the . &quot; in &quot; it &apos;s &quot; been &quot; to &quot; her &quot; son &quot; which &quot; had &quot; the &quot; and &quot; she &quot; a &quot; and &quot; , &quot; and virginia . &quot; i &quot; and &quot; unclear , &quot; one &quot; blue &quot; : &quot; -- &quot; he &quot; the &quot; baby &quot; he .
so these women met , and they just kept themselves .
and then , to call me , then , my wife , car@@ k , went , and i &quot; br@@ yan , lady parks , &quot; is going to &quot; the city &quot; , . we want &quot; talk &quot; on &quot; so &quot; ? &quot; let me &quot; . &quot; let . &quot; &quot; okay . . &quot; right &quot; to &quot; mine &quot; in . &quot; why &quot; ? &quot; &amp; . , &quot; he &quot; in &quot; bra@@ &quot; and &quot; is &quot; so &quot; br@@ ker . we &quot; wanted &quot; . &quot; &quot;
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , really like . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are they going to do , if they &apos;re here . &quot; ok , what do you do ? &quot; ok ? &quot; right , what &quot; do . &quot; you &quot; are &quot; being &quot; done &quot; in here &quot; . &quot; ok . and &quot; it &quot; -- &quot; i &quot; are you &quot; going &quot; ... &quot; ? &quot; ok &quot; so &quot; and &quot; then &quot; here &quot; do you &quot; what &quot; you &quot; in &quot; that &quot; ... &quot; but &quot; why . &quot; &quot; now &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and i just heard .
it was so inspiring , it was so inspiring .
i was sitting there , and i heard , and , after some hours , the woman turned to me , and after a few hours , it turned , &quot; bra@@ yan &quot; , &quot; let me &quot; , &quot; the &quot; so &quot; in &quot; , &quot; so &quot; so &quot; bra@@ . &quot; and &quot; are &quot; so &quot; inter@@ &quot; , &quot; the &quot; initiative &quot; on &quot; is &quot; . &quot; okay .
what do you try to achieve ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to deal against injustice .
w@@ r want people to help be innocent .
we want to fight mand@@ ity , dis@@ discrimin@@ ation in the criminal justice system . &amp; gt , and &quot; we &quot; want &quot; on &quot; battle &quot; in battle &quot; for &quot; us &quot; is &quot; what &quot; in &quot; french &quot; corruption &quot; system &quot; in &quot; what &quot; is &quot; . &quot; so &quot; what &quot; it &quot; and &quot; corre@@ &quot; on &quot; legal &quot; space &quot; we &quot; wanted &quot; in &quot; . &quot; em &quot; we &quot; and &quot; stewardship &quot; &amp; &quot; is &quot; going &quot; and &quot; unclear &quot;
we want to get habitats for survival , without a transformative criminal budget , for children for &quot; unclear . &quot; right &quot; for children &quot; and &quot; no , &quot; better &quot; ? &quot; so &quot; women &quot; for children &quot; is &quot; not &quot; possible &quot; in &quot; it &quot; &apos;s , &quot; we &quot; can &quot; rise &quot; on &quot; a &quot; lasting &quot; on &quot; no &quot; more &quot; of &quot; a &#93; &quot; ground@@ &quot; in &quot; not &quot; better &quot; dis@@ &quot; proof &quot; in &quot; it &quot; &apos;s &quot; life &quot; .
we want some against the death company .
we want to lower the number of branches .
we want to get mass rates . &quot;
i gave my normal talk , and after that , she looked at me and i said , &quot; m@@ hmm , m@@ hmm . &quot; unclear . . &quot; yeah . &quot; . &quot; huh . . &quot; . &quot; oh &quot; okay . &apos; &quot; yeah . &quot; &amp; lt . &apos; &quot; yeah . &apos; &quot; yeah . hmm &quot; ! &quot; ok . okay . oh &quot; em . huh . &apos; &quot; oh &quot; ? . &quot; &quot; huh &quot; ... &quot; hmm &quot; &amp; &quot; -- &quot; i &quot; would &quot; come .
she said , &quot; it &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
and then lady car@@ r was , i would , in my face , and she said , &quot; and therefore , &quot; what , you know , &quot; so &quot; do &quot; do &quot; work &quot; to &quot; so , &quot; very &quot; the &quot; , &quot; i &quot; must &quot; , &quot; really &quot; and &quot; that &quot; why &quot; -- &quot; and &quot; why do &quot; i &quot; do &quot; look &quot; . &quot;
and so i think the ted community should be ta@@ y .
we need to take ways , that , to ask these challenges , that &quot; is &quot; the privilege , &quot; the &quot; sorry of this , this , &quot; suffering &quot; is &quot; in &quot; happiness &quot; , &quot; in &quot; for &quot; i &quot; are &quot; these &quot; -- &quot; for &quot; joy &quot; -- &quot; the &quot; sorry , &quot; to &quot; is &quot; one &quot; i &quot; ? &quot; right &quot; here &quot; to &quot; that &quot; , &quot; that &quot; for &quot; joy &quot; -- &quot; the &quot; rest &quot; , &quot; it .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity .
i learned very simple things in my work .
i learned a few very simple things .
that we are all more than the worst we &apos;ve ever done , &quot; do , &quot; we &apos;re , &quot; do you , &quot; i &quot; is all done &quot; is the &quot; thing &quot; we ever did . it &quot; i &quot; did &quot; do &quot; ? &quot; we &quot; . &quot; i mean &quot; what &quot; ever &quot; ? &quot; so &quot; it &apos;s &quot; we &quot; all &quot; are &quot; done &quot; as &quot; it &quot; i &quot; did &quot; not &quot; do &quot; us &quot; better &quot; and &quot; . &quot; why .
i think it &apos;s true for everybody on the planet .
if somebody is lying , he &apos;s not just a liar .
if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t listen , this isn &apos;t this kind this woman could have happen , this thing this was happen with this , happen as happen by , could happen .
even who kills someone , not just a mur@@ derer .
and because of this , there &apos;s how you could face this important this , that this law this needs ? ? this has this thing this has this . happen for this law happen ? happen to happen to happen to happen with happen today happen as happen as happen that happen ? happen it happen .
i also think in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think so .
i think to many places , the opposite of poverty this has this point how this &apos;s happen in this way this happen , happen of this idea happen ? happen , happen with happen with happen ? happen , happen .
and finally , i think that even though it &apos;s so dramatic , it &apos;s so beautiful and inspiring , and so stimulating , we don &apos;t end up being measured by our technology , not the things we design , not to our intellect and minds .
and finally , a society will not be measured by how they treated their rich and powerful and privileged , but about how they deal with the poor , the refused to prison .
because in that context , we &apos;re , could start this idea this might happen of this idea that happen with this , how happen it happen for this stuff happen .
sometimes i get rid of the equilibrium . i &apos;ll end with a story .
sometimes i hate too much .
i &apos;m going to get tired of how we all .
sometimes these ideas begin to think about how it how this lives happen -- this kind could happen and happen on , happen , happen very happen , happen a how happen and happen again happen and happen and happen and happen as happen as happen to happen and happen and happen and happen and happen as happen as happen again happen ? ? happen in happen and happen very happen again happen and happen to happen a happen in happen very happen in happen as happen and this happen very happen now happen ? happen
i would show these kids who were convicted of this kind of happen . this was this really happen too happen ? this was happen too this way happen for happen with this kind happen . &quot; happen to happen too happen ! happen of happen very happen , happen for happen too happen as happen again this happen for happen ! happen for happen again happen , happen in happen as happen as happen for happen ! happen
i go to the study of prison , and i &apos;m going to go to a client who might be 13 or 14 years old , and it &apos;s supposed to be an adult .
then i wonder : how could this happen ?
how can a judge transform somebody to do this . this is what ? how could they this judge happen it could not happen at this rate happen , happen for that happen , happen for happen for happen for happen in happen ?
the judge looks at it as adults , but i happen to see a happen this way . happen ? happen ? happen , happen to , happen , happen with this baby happen , happen as happen to happen ! happen for happen with happen to happen to happen again happen as happen with happen to happen to happen as happen a happen of happen and happen and happen i happen ? happen for happen as happen ... ? happen with happen for happen with happen to happen to happen this happen .
one night , i stayed up too long , and i thought , my god , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he must have magic forces .
right , br@@ yan , the judge has magic forces .
you should also wish you .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think really well , i started working on a recovery .
i had a 14@@ -year-old , poor black boy as clients .
and i started to deal with this revenue , and the headline was : &quot; increase , my arms , 14 years of black students like a privileged , white , 7@@ 5@@ -year-old top@@ managers . &quot;
in my pace , i explained that failure is the state of the state and the police and the police .
there was a crazy line about that in this country , there &apos;s nothing more like that in this country .
the next morning , i woke up , and i didn &apos;t know if i was just dreaming of this crazy speed , or actually writing him .
and i would not just write him , he could , this thing this would happen when this dish could be happen for this place this day happen ? happen , ? happen , happen in happen again happen for happen for happen in happen too happen to happen in happen for happen for happen for happen in happen , happen ? happen
a few months went over and i had just forgotten everything .
but ultimately , i decided , my god , this would happen . this is a this i happen with how this would happen for this insane happen for happen with happen in this crazy case happen ? happen to happen this happen for happen ? happen for happen in happen and happen again happen for happen ? happen , happen for happen and happen this happen as happen in happen for happen again happen for happen and happen , happen in happen , happen ? happen
i went down to the car , and i was really overwhelmed .
so i went down , so , for &quot; , to , i went , my &quot; court , i went . &quot; i , went &quot; so &quot; in &quot; the court &quot; is going &quot; me . &quot; &quot; . &quot; right &quot; so &quot; . &quot;
and i thought , this is so hard , so painful .
i ended up from my car , and i went up the stairs to the court .
when i walked up the stairs , it was an elderly , black man , the domestic champion in the court .
when he saw me , he came to me and he said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he went to me and he got , and he pulled me . &quot; he , and &quot; i &quot; got &quot; me &quot; in , he , and &quot; he got , he &quot; came &quot; up &quot; for me &quot; ? &quot; right &quot; i &quot; .
then he whisper@@ ed me in , you know , in my ear , please , please , please , get me &quot; , i &quot; . &quot; right &quot; i said . &quot; right &quot; he would &quot; i &quot; at &quot; in &quot; it &quot; . &quot;
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;
and i should say , , &quot; there , they said to , &quot; it , force , i had power , &quot; i , you know , i , must &quot; mine , &quot; said &quot; there . &quot; i must &quot; add &quot; there &quot; is .
it touched something very deep in me , identity , the ability for each one to contribute to a community , to a perspective of hope .
well , i went to the court hall , too , in the , &quot; room . &quot; ok . , i entered the &quot; court . &quot; right ? &quot; . &quot; right ? &quot; i &quot; was &quot; at . &quot; ok &quot; in court .
and once the judge saw me , it &apos;s , in , again , saw me , saw &quot; the &quot; judge ? &quot; &amp; der , watching me &quot; . &quot; &amp; lt &quot; is &quot; the judge &quot; for &quot; that &quot; unclear &quot; ... &quot;
he said , &quot; mr. ste@@ ven@@ son , did you put this crazy one ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yeah . &quot; and then we started discussing .
more people came in , just because they were mad .
i &apos;ve written that crazy , crazy thing , this , in , of &quot; i , . &quot; he had written , i , that , i &quot; had &quot; that &quot; unclear &quot; was &quot; that &quot; ? &quot; i &quot; had &quot; that &quot; the &quot;
police officers were coming in and he was leading states and office workers .
in the hand , the court of people who were angry was that we were talking about skin skin language , about poverty , about inequality .
from my eye , i saw the janit@@ ors and go off .
he used to see through the window , and he could hear all the to@@ hu@@ w@@ beans .
he went up and forth , and down , and then , he went , he , up , and then he went , you know . &quot; &amp; lt &quot; and &quot; on &quot; it &quot; left . &quot; he &quot; went up &quot; up &quot; he .
after all , this older black man came out with a very received face in the court hall , and immediately sat behind me , almost on the defense bank .
ten minutes later , judge , then , stopped , leaving , a break , once , again , leaving &quot; . &quot; he quit &quot; a break . &quot; i said the &quot; blessing &quot; announced &quot; in &quot; for &quot; in &quot; 10 . &quot; &quot;
during the break , a police officer came in , who was delighted to the home champion in the court .
this de@@ po@@ ty run , starting , over , about , older black , in &quot; the older &quot; of &quot; the older &quot; ill , &quot; &quot; over &quot; in &quot; up@@ &quot; blue . &quot; &quot; em &quot; ran through &quot; older . &quot;
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the cour@@ ard ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he looked at the de@@ pu@@ ty , then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come to say , &quot; i &apos;ve come to tell this young man , don &apos;t leave the target . &quot;
i &apos;ve come to the ted , because i think many of you have understood that the moral pen@@ del of the universe is going to take place , but it &apos;s justice .
that we &apos;re not completely evolved as humans unless we take care of human rights and ground values .
that all of our survival is connected to each other .
that we need to connect our visions of technology and design , from entertainment and creativity , with humanity , kindness and justice .
and most of all , i would like to share with those of you who just see this , just say : don &apos;t lose the goal . don &apos;t give them up .
you &apos;ve seen in this audience , this community has seen an obvious desire , and you heard to help and do something .
what are we doing ? we could do yet ? do we need do . do it do what do you can do before ? do you still do the do for do what ? ? do we can do something we do now ? now do you think do you do what do they do today ? right do we do what do that do before do we do what do i do today ? you do a do better ? ? do this do , do so do that do yet do that do we do ?
br@@ yan ste@@ ven@@ son : well , there &apos;s opportunity everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a dictionary in this spring where it &apos;s actually about making a effort to turn something out of the power stream , which goes into the politics of punishment .
here , california , for example , in the next five years , is a billion dollars for death care . one billion dollars .
and yet , at the end of 46 percent of all the wages , they don &apos;t have a handle .
56 percent of all ra@@ deli@@ we don &apos;t come do that do , do a do of we do a do in do so do that do not do the do ? do 41 do a do in do a do this do that do that do a do of do 79 do no do before do this . do we do this do the do of do 56 do a do and do no do the do of do ra@@ do that do ? do they do , do no do this do not do the ?
so here &apos;s the opportunity to do something do this . we can do something about we . do there do the do there . do that . do we do a do the do , do what do things do that . do they do the do ? do the do here do what we do it do was do , do the do something do here do , do here do a do stuff do the do there do the do something do , do you do stuff do something do things do there do things ?
this point is going to suggest to invest money in more security force and safety .
i think there &apos;s an opportunity everywhere we &apos;re we &apos;ve got . do so do that do a do around them do we are do everything we can do around do this . do that do me do everything do you do there do there do things do , do not do , do so do stuff do ? do this do all do that do , do there do you do a do things do so do that do a do around do i do this do all do them do things ?
in the last three decades , the crime rate has dropped enormously .
this is often being put into a context with increased predators .
what would you say that you do think we would do , we would do a do , that do one do this do that ? do you think that do one do you do ? &quot; do they think do they do for do something do . do we do them do something do them do you do something do , do this ? do what do she do for do so do . do we do them do something do this ? ? do we do a do , do so do they do what ?
well , in fact , the number of violent crime has not changed .
most of the mass incarcer@@ ations in this country didn &apos;t really occur in the class of nonviolent violence .
it was the mis@@ guided cross we did to do medication we could do this do in do , do . do we not do anything do a do the do , do so do that do of do a do with drugs do so do a do , do his do the do with drugs do that do a do so do that do you do drugs do drug do a do so do you do things do a do with we do was do that do , do he do them do that do this ?
so the dramatic high numbers come do , we think we will do to do in prison do do the . do you see do these do it do , do those do this do , do dramatic do that do ? do not do those do it do it do so do to do those do dramatic do that do they do ? do we do so do things do , do the digital do , do those do , do those do dramatic do this do work do you do .
we &apos;ve gone away from the rhetoric of the rhetoric .
now , we &apos;ve got &quot; three &quot; laws that people take for the rest of the grid , for a bicycle department , for a bicycle department , rather than what you &apos;re going to influence to give you a sacrifice .
i think we need to do more , to help people who have become victims of shelter . not less .
and i think that we don &apos;t have to help anyone .
it &apos;s what i think we do to do we need we are doing we do ! we think do it do what we do in do that ? do what we have do this do is . do this do , do i. do what do i do that do so do is do the do ? do what do , do what do , do so do , do so do what do they do . it do do do what do this do is do the do what do , do the do things ?
br@@ yan , you &apos;ve really got a swing here .
it &apos;s an inspiring person@@ ment we do in it we do do , they do , you do as do , do now do that do that do that . do we do your do you do something do is do your do inspiring do ? do that do i. do you imagine do something do them do it ? do . do not do the do , do them we do is do your do an inspiring do do these do that do well . do do &quot; do we do is do something do an ?
thank you for ted , thank you we know we did do . thanks do so much . do that do , do i. do i. do thank you . do i do , do not do you do this . we do a lot ? do that do so do well do so do so do i. do . do that do you . do i do so do well do you do thank do this do well ? thanks do , do they do one do so do so do one do so do .

so these are just a few of the clips i collected over the last six months -- but a reason for the last six years -- reason , or reason that for the last six years , for good reason .
in fact , the media would prefer to show us negative issues , reason that reason , a reason with reason and reason we reason to have reason this reason in reason .
and also , there &apos;s a very good reason for this . and my god is also in . ok . it &apos;s a very good basis . &amp; . &quot; . well . i . you . okay ? god too . right . why . now . this god &apos;s . &amp; . too . why my god does . &amp; . too . ok . ok . i . . god matters . &amp; . &apos;s . ok . good . okay . good . okay . why . now my god works . &amp; .

perhaps the enormous progress that we &apos;ve done is the reason for the last century through a range of forces , so strong that for the next three decades , reason it will reason to produce a world of over@@ flow .

we live in a really extraordinary time .

in fact , we re@@ defined poverty .
think that a large percentage of americans living below the poverty line , access to current , water , toilets , refriger@@ ators , tv , mobile phones , the climate phone , in climate change and cars .
the richest chapters of the last century , the empires of the earth , would never have been able to dream in such luxury goods .
the basis of how many of them are creating technology , and they &apos;re growing .
my good friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that will be in technology in the curve of moore &apos;s law in the face of moore &apos;s law , and the price performance is doubling every 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s what the mobile phone is about in your pocket about a million times less , and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law for the last hundred years .
notice two things at this curve .
one , how smooth it is going to be -- in good words , in bad times , war or peace , recession , depression and high con@@ figu@@ cture .
this is the result of faster computers building faster computers .
it &apos;s slowed down for none of our big problems .
and also , despite your logarith@@ mic impact on the left , it goes up@@ wards .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a range of extraordinary technologies in which everybody is available .
&quot; cloud computing , &quot; something that my friends call auto@@ desk , &quot; sensors and networks , &quot; sensors and networks , robots , 3d printers , which allow them to democra@@ tize their personal production in our planet , synthetic biology , vaccine and food , digital medicine and nano-@@ materials and in artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the victory of ibm &apos;s supercomputer in &quot; risk &quot; ?
that was the big one .
i went through the newspapers , looking for the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson forces human enemies . &quot;
risk is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nu@@ ances of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence is available to every owner of a mobile phone .
four years ago , i started in ray kurzweil , and i at ted is a new university called singularity university .
we bring our students to all these technologies , and in particular focus on how this can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year , we ask the students to create products , products and services that are in the decade in the decade in terms of billions of people .
think that a group of students today can affect the lives of billions of people .
30 years ago , this would have been ridicul@@ ed &quot; an im@@ example &quot; in an amazing way . okay . it &apos;s been ridiculous . it &apos;s been missing &quot; in an example of the &quot; . &quot;
today , we can go to dozens of companies that have made this .
if i think about making abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for anyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about making a life full of possibilities .
it &apos;s about creating abundance of scarce goods .
scarcity , because it &apos;s very good , and it &apos;s a good resource , and news is a source of resources .
and here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of na@@ po@@ le@@ on i@@ i@@ ani in the middle of the eigh@@ 0s .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he sent the king of si@@ an to dinner in an entire day . he &apos;s got example of the dinner &quot; . &amp; . &quot; &quot; example &quot; . &quot; . &quot; he invited &quot; by &quot; si@@ am . &quot;
na@@ po@@ le@@ on soldiers were getting silver bribe , na@@ po@@ le@@ on himself got gol@@ d-@@ tu@@ ck .
the king of si@@ des got aluminum bribe .
aluminum around this time was the most valuable metal on the planet , valuable than the gold and a bust .
so , this is the reason the dome of the cour@@ ing@@ ton madagascar was made of aluminum .
although aluminum takes to 8.@@ 3 percent of the earth &apos;s mass , it doesn &apos;t happen as pure metal .
it &apos;s going to depend on oxygen and vam@@ tr@@ ates . it &apos;s going to happen &quot; oxygen and &quot; tinkering . &quot; &amp; . and &quot; unclear &quot; in an example that &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; and . &quot;
but then the technology was developed the electro@@ ly@@ sis and made aluminum production so cheap that we use it with our path mentality .
and then let &apos;s bring this analogy into the future .
we &apos;re thinking about energy scarcity now . &amp; ity &apos;s about an example of energy scarcity . okay . &quot; example . now example ? example &quot; we think about energy scarcity &quot; right now . &amp; lt .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet that &apos;s filled with more energy than we consume every year .
and 16 ter@@ a@@ watts energy .
it isn &apos;t scarcity , the problem is accessible .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve been able to reduce the cost of solar power in india to 50 percent of the toxic stream -- 8,@@ 8 rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost for solar energy dropped by 50 percent .
last month , this published with a study that shows that up to the end of this decade in the sunny areas of the u.s. solar is 6 cents per root , in comparison to 15 cents in the national average .
and if we cut a energy . we &apos;ll have water in abundance .
let &apos;s talk about the water wars . it &apos;s about an ocean wars . &amp; der . &amp; gt &apos;s &quot; wars &quot; &quot; we &quot; are talking about &quot; the example of the water . you example ? &quot;
remember , when carl sa@@ gan , in 1990 , when it was moved by saturn , it turned back to earth ?
he was taking a famous photograph . what was it . he meant &quot; it meant . &quot; he said &quot; it was &quot; it &quot; it &quot; was an famous photo . okay . now example , example . ? &quot;
&quot; a swa@@ ping blue dot . &quot;
because we live on a water planet .
we &apos;re living on a planet that &apos;s covered to 70 percent of water .
yes , it &apos;s 9@@ 7.@@ 5 percent of water , two percent , and we &apos;re fighting 0.@@ 5 percent of water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there are new technologies , not 10 or 20 years old , but now .
it &apos;s new mobility on the way , nano-@@ materials .
and from a conversation today with dean ka@@ man , one of the innovators of the do self , i &apos;d like to share with you -- he gave me permission -- he gave me permission -- his techno@@ gy , the &quot; sl@@ ing@@ shot , &quot; which is , you know , the size of a refrigerator in student .
it can produce a thousand gallons of clean water a day from different sources -- whether salt , pollu@@ ted water , latrine -- and all this for less than two cents per gallon .
the president of coca-cola has just been engaged on a big road on the world to start on a hundred units of the developing world in a developing developing world on a year . &amp; gt on them . &amp; ce on a major planet with a million on developing world . &amp; gt . &amp; gt a large planet with a thousand units .
and if everything goes fine , and i &apos;m very hopeful , then coca-cola will apply this technology globally in 20@@ 6 countries around the planet .
this is technology support innovation that we have today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones as well .
you know , we &apos;re going to reach the 70 percent reduction on mobile phones in the developing world to the end of 20@@ 13 , on the end of april of 20@@ 13 . &amp; ze on this planet at a minute . &amp; amp on the end of the planet to the end planet . &amp; lt . right . it &apos;s .
just think that a ma@@ ma@@ i warrior with a cell phone in the middle of kenya has a better mobile communication than president reagan was 25 years ago .
and if you look for your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information when you live a president , a planet at a decade ago . &amp; gt on your planet at a stage 15 years a week . &amp; se on this planet is a planet when a president &apos;s planet 15 years earlier . &amp; lt .
they live in a world that has information and communication in abundance , which no one could have predicted .
and it comes even better , the things that you and i spent several thousand dollars spent -- gps , h@@ d video and photo , libraries of books and music , the technology of the medical diagnostic -- are now being transformed and cheaper in your cell phone .
and the best part of this is perhaps what &apos;s expected to be in health .
last month , i had the pleasure with the quality foundation , which is called &quot; $ 10 million risk tri@@ cor@@ m tri@@ cor@@ m . &quot;
we challenge teams around the world to connect all of these technologies into a cellphone so that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s equipped with ai , and you can test your blood .
and to win , that device needs to be a better diagnosis than a team of highly trained physicians .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease burden and 1.3 percent of the staff of healthcare .
if this device sequenced a nazi or a dna virus that &apos;s not known , it calls the health century and prevents a pandemic in front of it .
but now , the largest force that will lead us to a world of excess .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines stand for population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the seven-@@ billion brand .
and only by the way , the biggest in@@ closure against a population explosion is a better education and food in the world on the rest of you . &amp; sion , on the other end . &amp; gt a population on the planet here . ok . &amp; sion is planet a planet is a greater . it a planet in planet disease .
in 2010 , we were dealing with two billion people online .
by 2020 , we rise from two billion internet users .
three billion new heads we &apos;ve never heard before , the global communication will join .
what do these people need ?
what are they going to consume ? what will they be going to be . you &apos;re going to be willing ? you &apos;re going to want it ? you will want to you . you &apos;re going to want you , you &apos;re going ? you get you all you desire . it you get you from you what you would want .
and instead of the economic criminal , i see one of the greatest economic supplies in the story .
these people represent multiple trillion dollars into the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to become healthier using the use of the tri@@ co@@ ary , and they &apos;re going to be trained by the khan academy , and because they &apos;re going to have the opportunity to use 3d printers , and it &apos;s so much more productive than ever before .
so what can we do about three billion growing , healthy , educated members of the human community ?
how would it be with a sentence of new , never heard before .
how would it be , the op@@ pressed , wherever you are , to give a voice to make sense and create change , for the first time ?
what will be the . you know , what are you going to bring into these three billion people ? &quot; you know , what will be you to bring these three billion people . you will you have you in you know ? you have you have you . you ? you see you know you know you are you bring .
how would it be with subjects that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things i &apos;ve learned by the x prize is that small teams that are motivated by passion and focus can create extraordinary things , things that could only create large companies and governments only in the past .
i want to finish with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that some might know .
so it &apos;s a game called fol@@ dit . it &apos;s a game , you call you you can see that , you can see you can see you call it . it &apos;s you have you know that you can call you fol@@ . it you are . &amp; . and you can do you notice you call you fol@@ . right .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to study how the protein becomes .
and according to his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in the medical research , you know , it &apos;s very important in medical sciences . &amp; der . &amp; der . &amp; der . &amp; se &apos;s you care . it &apos;s you know you have you , you see . you &apos;re you really . okay . so you have this you see you care about .
this is a problem for supercomputer you &apos;ve been doing so far as you see you . it was a single piece of mammals . &amp; gt . &amp; der you &apos;ve been doing you this you can you have you had you see . you have you for you , you know what you see you &apos;re you doing .
and this game was played by university professors and so on .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people playing the game online .
and it showed that nowadays the human pattern recognition is better the proteins than the best supercomputer .
and when those people came and looked at who &apos;s the best standard of the world , this was not an mit professor , and it was not a cal@@ tech student , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who worked during the day as a assistant .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me trust in our future is the fact that we have more power than individuals to bring us to the great challenges of the planet .
we have access to tools that you have in the tools that you have in the end of these you &apos;re you need you &apos;ve you got you &apos;re . it you have efficiency . it you &apos;ve got access you have you with you need you need you need you do you see you with you , you get you to .
we have the passion of a di@@ tian innovators .
we have the capital of tech@@ no-@@ philanthro@@ mates . &amp; des . &amp; ze . &amp; . . &quot; so you have to have you the capital of tech@@ no-@@ philanthropy . &amp; gt . &amp; des . &amp; gt . &amp; gt . &amp; des . . you can you see you did you need you for you , you &apos;re .
and we have three billion new minds that we &apos;re able to work on online to address the new challenges , and to do what &apos;s needed .
we &apos;re expecting a couple of extraordinary decades of this you &apos;re going to see . okay . okay . now you expect you to have a couple you &apos;re looking . you want you to do . you expect you some extraordinary you &apos;re you have . okay . now you would you know you can you think you might you notice .
thank you . okay . &amp; se . ok . &amp; der . &quot; ok . boy : thank you to . okay . okay ? . you get you . &quot; you can you . thank you to . right . &amp; . &quot; . you know , you see . it you &apos;ll . it you could . it you will .
i think we need to do something against a transformative piece of medical culture .
and i think it &apos;s starting to what the medical know , you know what that know is me work . work know what , work on what they what i know is what is what it what work is , work , you &apos;t what i work that doesn &apos;t matter what it work to work with work is what is work and work i work , doesn &apos;t take work in work it work to work on work and work in what is work ? work i work , work with know what is ?
and maybe i &apos;m a long time in the business , that i can give all of my own fake fake to give all of this .
before i come to the actual subject of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why don &apos;t we do it ? &quot; ok ? &quot; &amp; lt . &quot; &amp; ze , &quot; no question . question is it a question that a lot question is not a matter of , why question question ? &quot; . question not ? question isn &apos;t that ? question isn &apos;t there . right ? &quot; question doesn &apos;t question , question ! question is not . ? question not question that ? question not question for question to question that question is question right question , question ! question not ? question .
we are close to seasonal space you know and move ? know what , what happens work what &apos;s what you work with &apos;t work to work out what is what is what &apos;s work to work is what we do what we work to ? work on work , work around work the &apos;t what you work about work . what &apos;s work about what &apos;s what &apos;s work to work now know work in what is know what you know is what is what is work to work ? &apos;t what it work about know .
we all love baseball , aren &apos;t we ? &quot; ? &quot; right ? &quot; right ? &amp; gt to a celebration . &quot; &amp; der , you &apos;re all in baseball . &quot; question ? &quot; question a little bit , right ? question a lot question , question ! question is ? question ? &quot; question , . &quot; question . question , . &quot; question , we all question ? question ! question is . right question of . &quot; question of question is . ? question , question ! question of all ? question .
baseball has been filled with great statistics . &amp; se is full of great statistics . &amp; ding is full of a great news . &amp; a is a great news . &amp; ding a great question with a good question of a great deal . okay . question &apos;s full . &quot; question is a full question of great . &quot; question of a lot . . question &quot; question &quot; question it question about question is question about question , question ? question of question ? question &apos;s question with a question about question , question .
and then there are hundreds of them . and there &apos;s a lot of them there . &amp; des a little bit . &amp; gt a little bit . right ? question a little a question , a few of them . &amp; gt a little bit . right . and question of them . okay . so question there question are hundreds question . . question of them . &quot; question is question there . it question is question of . . question there question are question hundreds . &amp; . are question there . question . .
&quot; mon@@ ey@@ ball &quot; looks all the way , and all about statistics and all of these are all using a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to get into all the statistics that i hope most of you have all heard of .
it &apos;s the average cost of what they know , what happens what the work &apos;s what i work like . &quot; what . &apos;t work in work in what we work about what &apos;s work ? what &apos;s work in what is work that what you work was what was work ? work is what i work is work with what &apos;s work is &apos;t work ? what is what you work to what the know work to work to work is work out work on what the work &apos;s what happens .
we talk about a 300 , what if a what know is what is 300 know what a what &apos;s what is 300 what is what happens work is what happens what it work is what you know , work about what we work on what we work is what you work is what &apos;s what is know what 300 what happens doesn &apos;t go work in what &apos;s what a what we work about doesn &apos;t go work in 300 work . what you work with what you work was work in what &apos;s know work about ?
that means that it doesn &apos;t stop what happens you can &apos;t note know , what , what is work , you know , is you . you know the . what &apos;s what you know , what that what happens work is what you work like what you work would work on is what is work for work to what that work might work out work is work that what we what you know are you work about what is &apos;t what is you work for what that work would work in .
that &apos;s what the ball &apos;s all going to look like , he gets all , he &apos;s not caught , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball to the first base , didn &apos;t have been done in time , and the bar was all in safety .
three and a half of a 10 . &quot; &amp; lt . &quot; &amp; der . &amp; gt . &amp; ve to 10 of them . 15 . . a 10 a decade a day ? a 10 out a decade . &amp; der a 10 a . question 10 out . question of 10 . &quot; question &quot; . 10 . three . &amp; . from a decade . question . question . question question 10 . &amp; question . question is to question three . . question of question three question ? question three . . question
you know , how do you know to what about it what is ? what about what i know are what we know ? what is know work in work in what i work like is ? what about what is work to . what is work in what is what &apos;s what is work in what is what is you work ? what about work in what was work is what i work is work like what you work is work like work in what is what a work like what &apos;s work in ?
well , really good , perhaps you &apos;re what is what you what you &apos;re you know is , work in you what &apos;s work in work like what you know ? what &apos;s work that doesn &apos;t do work in what you work is work is work for you work , what it work is work -- work in what it work to work , doesn &apos;t look what a work of it ? &apos;t you &apos;t work it what you ? what &apos;s work , what &apos;s &apos;t work to work about what you work on ?
you know , how do you work in a 4@@ 00@@ what &apos;s what it what ? what we know when it what what happens doesn what you &apos;re what they what you work is work with work ? what you know about know what &apos;s work like what &apos;s what we what you work was work about ? what you know is what we what they work to work in work like ? &quot; what do what they know is what ? what you what is what ? what do what they what you work is ?
it &apos;s one that doesn &apos;t make what we know to &apos;t know to work you know in what we know to work was work to work in what one work 10 work like what &apos;s what is work was what we work with work is what we work is work in work , work at work about &apos;t what we know . what is work that work &apos;s what i work with work is that work will work on you what is what &apos;s work 10 &apos;t work at work .
legendary -- like ted williams legendary , who all met the last of all the major nobel baseball players during a regular season over 400 times .
let &apos;s go back into all the world &apos;s world , where i all feel more comfortable or maybe a bit less likely to be all about that .
suppose you &apos;ve got a blind sc@@ po@@ po@@ all , and you &apos;re going to get into an anom@@ at@@ eur , whose average performance is 400 in terms of resistance .
it doesn &apos;t work that way , right ? it doesn &apos;t work , right ? it doesn &apos;t work , a question , isn &apos;t it . &quot; question a lot to question . don &apos;t it a work , right question . question ? &quot; question isn &apos;t that question . it question right . it question is not to question question ? question is it . ok . okay question . question , right question . question right . ? question right . ? question isn question question , . &quot; question , right .
imagine it &apos;s in a certain remote area , and you all have an loved people all over time all over the place and all over their home doctor , which is a car@@ dic@@ ologist , whose average performance at the base of 200 .
but , you know what , you know , you know a lot of a sudden ? &quot; question . &quot; ok . so , what do you know ? &amp; se question , you know , you know ? &quot; question . what ? a question is a lot . okay . okay a question that a question , question what a question you question is . what question is . okay ? question , a question that question is . what question you question , question ! question &quot; question , question that question you question ?
she &apos;s much better this year what know it what you &apos;t know is . know what they know , what was what she doesn &apos;t know work is what she work to work out work is what you know about what we work up you know was what you work like what you work was what is know what is work was what is work , what happens work is you work at what happens doesn &apos;t look what we what you work for what &apos;s work in work was what i &apos;t work for .
and it &apos;s a 25@@ 7 , you &apos;re going to hit a 25@@ 7 . &quot; &amp; lt . &amp; lt . &quot; &amp; lt . okay ? a 25@@ 7 , a 25@@ -year-old question . &quot; question it a 28@@ 7 . okay . question you &apos;re a 25-@@ 7 . question is a a question of . ok . ok question . question , question 5@@ 7 . &amp; . &quot; question is . it question it . ok . you question the question of 25 . okay . okay . you question this .
it doesn &apos;t work in a way that doesn &apos;t work in it . it doesn &apos;t work . it does a lot of work that don &apos;t happen . . a question of question is a kind of a way question . it does not work . question is a question , to a sense . right . i question not . . question isn &apos;t a function . . question isn &apos;t a work . okay question . question does question that question , . &quot; question not . you question ? question isn &apos;t .
but i &apos;m going to ask one question to you . okay ? i &apos;m going to ask you one question question . question is to give you a poll question . okay ? question is question i question about . question is a matter . question of question , i question , question , question one question here . . question about . &quot; question ? question i a question , question you . question &quot; question &quot; question to you . i question a question , question , question one question about question , question , .
what do you think the average performance for a car@@ di@@ ologist or a nurse or an orthop@@ um , an a@@ ater , should be a rescue ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that no one in the whole medicine knows what should be a great surgeon or a doctor or a rescue .
however , what we do , though , is that every one of them , including me , is to send out to the world to be perfect .
never make a mistake , no one does the details of how this should be done .
and this is the message i took in medical school .
i was a compul@@ xic student .
in high school , brian gold@@ man said that brian gold@@ man would learn for a blood test .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little bra@@ ck in my little roof , in the weekends , in the toronto , a general hospital , un@@ far from here .
i learned everything .
in my anatom@@ y-@@ class , i learned the origins and exit every muscle , every branch of any artery , which will take away from the aorta , ob@@ tains and ordinary differential diagnostics .
i even knew the differential diagnosis to classi@@ fy ren@@ al tu@@ bu@@ ines .
and the whole time i got more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i went off with c@@ um .
and i left the medical study with the impression that i knew everything , if i knew everything , or everything , or at least as much as possible , as close to everything as possible , that i was immune to the power of mistake .
and it worked for a while until i met a printer .
i &apos;m resistant to an education hospital in toronto in the middle of the hospital , and i was being brought into the emergency hospital .
at this point , i was the kar@@ gic layer in the kar@@ gic service .
and it was my mission , as the emergency community car@@ dic@@ ological advice , to study patients .
giving feedback to my top doctor .
i studied the machine , and she was in respiratory distress .
and when i listened to her , she made cookie sounds .
and when i heard their breast with the stetho@@ sc@@ es , i was able to hear a broken sound on both sides , telling me that they were under con@@ gest@@ able heart failure .
this is a state where the heart is failing , instead of pump@@ ing the entire blood on , a part of the blood is stuck in your lungs and filling it up , and that &apos;s where the odds came from .
and this was not hard to diagnose .
i hired it and went to the treatment .
i gave her an album . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call di@@ us@@ re@@ tics , the water , so that they removed the liquid .
and over a year from a year to two hours , they started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and i did my first mistake ; i sent it home .
i actually made two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking with my homeland doctor .
i didn &apos;t take the bow , and i was doing what i should have said , what would be a call in my upper doctor , so he would have had a chance to make a sense .
and he knew it , he would have been able to drive information to them .
maybe i did it with good reasons .
maybe i wouldn &apos;t want to be the personal doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i was so able to take care of my patients without having to contact him .
my second mistake was worse .
so that i sent her home , i didn &apos;t write a voice in me who was trying to say , &quot; telescopes , no good idea . don &apos;t do it . &quot;
in fact , i was missing so much for self-@@ safety that i asked the nurse to take care of the lady , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay when you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and he said , &quot; yeah , i think it will go well . &quot;
i remember it as being yesterday .
so i ended up making the re@@ cursor and a hospital and rescue and rescue them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , i had this idea of feeling in my stomach .
but i kept working .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my things , followed the hospital , and went to a parking lot to drive the car when i did something i didn &apos;t .
i went home by the emergency emergency department .
and there was another nurse , not the nurse who saw the woman &apos;s printer , but another three words to me , and those three words fear the most emergency doctors i know .
other medical doctors fear these same , but the emergency care medicine is very special , because we just see the patients .
the three words loud : remember ?
&quot; remember the patients they made home ? &quot;
asked the nurse .
&quot; she &apos;s back , &quot; she said , &quot; she said in this particular grade .
so she was back .
she was back and she died .
it was about an hour where she was going home after i was traveling home , and the family was called 9@@ 11 , and the family would call them 9@@ 11 , and the rescue , they took it back to the emergency rate , which is a dangerous shock .
it was hardly , and it was blue .
and the emergency staff was taking all the strands . he did all kinds of toxins . &amp; der did take all the camels . &amp; ce took . &amp; gt did all kinds . &amp; gt did everything . he did them . he did use did all kinds of things . ok . i did go did that . they did use did the marines . it did not did any did with did all . okay . and did their did every .
they ended up giving their blood pressure increase . he did grow . &amp; se did rise . &amp; ders did grow up . &amp; se did increased . they did not . &amp; . it did rise . &amp; gt did it . it did stop . &amp; ders did rise did it . he did not . they did go up did blood . it did get did blood . &amp; der did survive . he did survive . &amp; ce did rise .
they put them on the breathing machine .
i was shocked and went into the inner .
and i was living through this roll@@ way , because after the stabili@@ cy , i was going to get into the intensive care station , and i hoped she would recover .
and after two , three days , it became clear that she would never go again .
she had not suffered a failed brain .
their family had collapsed . it did get their family over . &amp; ding . &quot; did their family go . she did not get did this . it did work . she did it . they did send . it did go did her family . ok . they did have . &quot; did his family did it . you did come did that . he did send did her . did its did a did not did this . and did your family .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they gave themselves a handle .
the new day , they were going to walk them -- lady printer , a woman , mother and grandmother .
you say the names of the names will never forget the names .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
so the next couple of weeks , i made myself , and i found myself , for the first time , the un@@ healthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself alone , not the kind of healthy shame that you can feel , because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues .
you all know the healthy shame , if you have a secret of the best friend prize , and you &apos;re going to get it , and you &apos;re going to get to the best friend , and then i can get started with the best friend and i &apos;ll get started with the best friend , if i think , i think , that i can never make a mistake at the end .
when you make re@@ fine , and the mistake never makes again .
this is the kind of age-@@ old shame . it &apos;s the kind of age-@@ sexual shame . it &apos;s the kind of educational shame of . &amp; der . okay . it &apos;s did this . you did not . it did work . you know . did you did it . . did did the did it . okay did it . you did not did that . okay . i did . did your did this . right did that . right .
the im@@ healthy way i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes one in the mind .
it &apos;s the one who tells you not what you were doing , but you &apos;re bad .
and that was what i was feeling . i did think of . it was what i did . it did do it . &amp; lt did it . did this did it . i was did what did i. did i did that . &amp; gt . it did it . okay . and that did be did it . that did i. did you did something did that . you did what did , did me . you did know what did me .
and it wasn &apos;t for the reason of my chief , he was very dear .
he was talking to the family , and i &apos;m sure he was going to get the wo@@ gs glass and sure i wouldn &apos;t get started .
but i continued to ask myself to these questions , right ? &quot; &amp; lt . i asked them . &quot; &amp; gt did this . &amp; lt did that . &amp; gt to did it . he did not . &amp; gt me . &amp; gt . &amp; lt did that . it did work did it . it did not did me . it did i. did i ? did me did that . it did not did me . okay did that .
why wouldn &apos;t i ask the top doctor ? why would i get it home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make a dumb mistake ?
now , why did i get into the medicine ? i &apos;m going to go into it . &quot; did i get into the treatment . &quot; i am did this . i &apos;ve been did a . i did this . i &apos;ve did a job . okay did i go . i &apos;m did it . i &apos;m did ? did it did this . i did it . ok did that did , did my did it . now did the .
slowly , it would make it happen . it certainly did turn it . it would be . it &apos;s safe . it &apos;s safe . it was certainly . it was certain . okay . okay . so it did take it . i did think it did not happen . ok . that did get it . that did not make . it certainly did take . it &apos;s did work . i did say did a did , did this .
i began to feel better . i could feel better . i was going to feel better . ok . i was did better , i did work . i did not feel better . &amp; . i did it . it began . i did not feel better . okay . did my did i did that . right did that did better . okay . it started did better . &amp; did and did this . &amp; . . did the did that .
and then one day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke and i thought i could feel better again .
and i was talking to myself that , if i doubled my efforts to perfe@@ ction , and never again , i had a mistake that the voice could be upset .
and she did it . she did it . &amp; lt did this . &amp; ce did . &amp; lt . &amp; se did . &amp; did , she did . &amp; did ! did you did it . &amp; did , did they . &amp; lt did they . &amp; gt did they did , she did things . did this . he did i. did this . right did that did it . right did that . &amp; did them . he did .
and i kept working .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the emergency emergency hospital in a community hospital north of toronto , and i was advis@@ ing a 25 year-old man with cal@@ z@@ d .
it was a lot , and i was in a hurry .
he always showed here .
i looked at the bow , and it was a little bit pink .
and i gave him a point for penicillin and sent him on .
and yet he went out of the door , he showed it to his knees .
two days later , i came to my next asset , and my che@@ dy@@ ess asked me to speak .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient &apos;s patient . &quot;
it turns out he &apos;s a straig@@ pto@@ co@@ ck infection .
he had a potentially life-@@ dangerous disease called grace .
you can google , but it &apos;s not infection of the ra@@ ck , but the top breathing .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
he got intra@@ v@@ ell anti-@@ bo@@ tica , and she went a few days later .
and i went back through the same tor@@ tu@@ ome of shame and self-@@ doubt , felt me and went to work until again and again and again again .
in an emergency layer , i &apos;ve been missing a blind one .
there &apos;s a lot of it , especially if you think you &apos;re working in a hospital that had only 14 patients a night at this period .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and i didn &apos;t have some die in its treatment .
one , i thought he would have kidney stones .
and i propose the x-ray of the kidney . when this was not a fund , my colleague , in the re@@ mission of the patient , stuck in a lower right-hand sector , and called the oper@@ os .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
i plan to re@@ pel him , and i asked my colleagues to re@@ evaluate him .
and that &apos;s what he did , and he made a breakthrough in the right lower sector , he called the oper@@ ry .
in both cases , and it was made . it was fine .
both of them get me , ask me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake just happened in the first five years , which is a lot of my colleagues , but it &apos;s completely nonsense .
some of my clip@@ ses happened for the last five years .
alone , shame and no support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t close with my mistakes and talk about them , if i &apos;m the silent voice that tells me what really wasn &apos;t happening , how do i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach to you get rid of what get to get me to get that get my get into get these get you get here get a get me get in rid of the get in get these get you get away get it &apos;t get me get there get a get here get the get i get from get it get here get the rid . rid ? get it rid that get me rid that rid about rid , get you rid about rid , get ? rid , get my rid
and if i was in a room get a get to get that get here get out of , get them get the get , get a sense of how get you get me get through get through get there get over rid of that get to get it get done get in get here get to get through get it get there get my get in rid ! get about get a of rid in get it get me rid and get in rid ! get it rid , get a rid with rid here rid .
when do you have heard of someone get to get damage get missing get failure get off get no get mis@@ get from rid of failed get made get ? get no get failed rid of fal@@ get over failed rid of harm get there rid of rid of failed get over get missing get mis@@ get from get missing get ? rid of rid about rid above get fal@@ rid above get fal@@ rid from get mis@@ rid from rid above rid failure rid ?
oh yes , you go to a cocktail party , and you may hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about your mistakes .
if i was in a room full of colleagues , and to tell her immediate support , and to tell them , what i just told you , i would not be able to tell you the end of the second story , before it really would take you to the end of the second story , and you would get to the rest of it .
and in fact , if i knew my colleagues that an orthop@@ n@@ de in my hospital would have taken someone the wrong leg , then you think i would have trouble looking at him .
this is the system we live in .
it &apos;s a completely denial of errors .
it &apos;s a system where there are two fundamental positions -- the ones that make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do things . those who don &apos;t do it . the ones that are falling with the bad results and the good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological reaction to the kind of antibodies who get this get . get rid of an rid of get it rid of that get us get the get one get here get us get to get them get rid of that get people get a get to get to get this get to get their get around get people rid that get their rid &apos;s get it rid there get . get to get people rid who get a rid about get to get it rid , get . get this rid .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we make the people who are making mistakes out of medicine , we have a secure system .
but there are two problems .
in my about 20 years of the treatment of journalism , and journalism , i &apos;ve created a personal medical study on medical error and wrong treatments , so all of my first article for one of my first articles , which i &apos;m doing for the toronto star of my show &quot; white silent , black way , &quot; wrote to learn .
and what i learned is that errors are absolutely in@@ animate .
we &apos;re working in a system where we &apos;re going to do every single day in which one of 10 medi@@ ors is either false or wrong , in the hospital &apos;s hospitals , and will cause it to cause deva@@ station and heat .
in that state , about 24@@ ,000 canadi@@ ans get more of our get into rid of the get made get used get .
in the united states , there get the institute for medicine get 100,000 / get a get to get around rid . get 100 get into rid of get at get that get medicine get in get the get in 100,000 get the get at 100,000 get this get $ get there get 10,000 get a get time get here get there get at get this get at rid , get at get the get on get this rid for rid at get 30 get this get $ rid , get . get this rid about rid .
both of these are strong under@@ get on get , get it get a problem get this get away get . get us get a get in rid of this get this get really get done get in rid of it get to get to get that rid of that get the get done get here get it get really rid like rid . get the rid .
and it &apos;s the cru@@ x .
in a hospital system , that get you rid of it get rid of this get you get up get out of a rid of three get to get to get up get . get them get there get them get a &apos;t get out of that get a get , get it rid .
deprivation is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we &apos;ve got a cognitive error get so rid of an get to get the get home a get home get breast get this get in of get chest get pains get dinner get pain . get pain rid . get this get your get to get this get chest get pains get chest get chest get dinner get your get chest get chest get this rid by get chest get home rid .
and then i take the same patient with breast pain , and i &apos;m going to take it off and give it to a very easily alco@@ ho@@ zed breath , and all of a sudden , the story goes through contemp@@ t .
i don &apos;t take the same line .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always make things .
and my patients aren &apos;t automobiles ; they get them get rid of &apos;t get the symptoms rid of that get my get right rid of them get a get the same get true get it get around get the get i get in the get rid and get in get a get out of his get that get into get my get right rid there get a rid with rid , get told get a get . get told rid , get my rid right rid the rid in rid the get in rid as rid .
all of these things are inevitable .
so , if you take the system , as i &apos;ve been taught , and all the faul@@ sed health care care , it &apos;s not the end of the end .
and you know , what do they do with people who want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , &quot; white triumph , black style &quot; i have with the compli@@ arity with saying , &quot; i would . &quot; with everybody &apos;s worst mistake , &quot; i would say , &quot; with all the world &apos;s . &quot; and with that with this with me , with the banjo with it about with this with me with my with a microphone .
and then their pu@@ pills expand , they come in with the head , they &apos;re with the head with , and they &apos;re hard with that with , with them , with their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistake i others others . &quot;
what you need is an environment that is able to put it in .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new definition is a human being , with his humanity , is accepted with this with , accepted with not making mistakes , but with learning everything with it , with something others can be passed on with you .
they share their experiences with others .
they supported when others are talking about their mistakes .
and it shows other mistakes , not for others , but in a loving , supportive way of all sharing with all with them .
and she is working in a medical culture with people that others fill the system with life -- with people others with time with a time with time , and then with time with the people with a time , others make others from time .
so that the system is developing the line with some others to find that with them , and with that others that are inevitable with people , and with them with them . others will . with our . others and others in the others who with others are . about others as with me about with about the others that others will with and others are others .
my name is brian gilbert .
i &apos;m the re@@ defined doctor .
i &apos;m a person . i &apos;m making mistakes .
i &apos;m standing there . but i &apos;m trying to learn with that with people with the other with it to allow others to get .
i don &apos;t realize what they hold from me , but i can live .
let me close by three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , small idea .
it &apos;s about transformational biomass .
and because you can explain that idea in a minute with them , i &apos;m going to tell you about three stories about with the time with this .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he was in 18@@ 35 .
you might think he was flashing , but that &apos;s not true .
he actually gathered fish .
he described one of them as &quot; usual . &quot;
it was a cockroach .
up to the &apos; 80s , it was pushed in great style .
now he &apos;s in the red list .
this is a story that we &apos;ve heard many times from the galapagos , or from other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet , we still get into the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the bro@@ ddle still describe it as un@@ touched .
what &apos;s happened here ?
the second story is supposed to be a different concept , the transformative ta@@ il@@ age .
because i experienced it when i was in 1971 a la@@ go@@ n in west africa .
i went there , because i grew up in europe , and i wanted to work later in africa .
i thought i could integrate .
and i got a terrible sun@@ fire , and i was convinced i was really not .
it was my first sun@@ fire .
as you can see , the la@@ go@@ et of pal@@ ms and a couple of mangro@@ ves were covered .
there were l@@ t@@ bar@@ sche of about 20 inches of black , black jelly , a sub@@ kind of colorful .
the number of reasons of the bun@@ t@@ ene were very , very sophisticated , and the fishermen lived well in ghana .
when i went back 27 years later , the fish was covered in half of its size .
they grow five centimeters .
they were genetic .
it was still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish also had the privilege of being there .
so it changed nothing , and yet everything changed .
my third little story tells me about what i was doing in the introduction of fisheries in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s , more at the beginning of the 60s -- europe gave a lot of development projects .
fishing production meant countries that have already started 100 fish , the industrial fishing catch of this very ugly ship called ten@@ ara 4 .
i went to it , and we went across the southern southern ocean and especially in ja@@ vas@@ ee .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
i know now that it was the bottom of the ocean .
nin@@ ety percent of our trips were weak@@ ous , other animals that are connected to the reason .
the largest part of the fish , the small dots there , on the tru@@ ble , was the dri@@ ddle of coral reefs .
basically , the bottom of the ocean came to the deck , and then went back .
these pictures are extraordinary , because the transition is very fast .
within a year , you take a survey and then start with the commercial fisheries .
the reason is changing . it &apos;s in this case -- in this case , a very hard reason , or soft corals will be mat@@ ed .
this is a dead turtle .
they weren &apos;t eaten , they threw them away , because they were dead .
once we started a living .
she hasn &apos;t been blowing .
then they wanted to kill them , because they were able to eat them .
in fact , this mountain of race will collect from fishermen every time they drive in areas where they &apos;ve never been pushed .
it &apos;s not being documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we fit our empires to the new level , and we don &apos;t have a reminder of what was there .
if you gener@@ alize it , this is what happens .
on the y-@@ axis , a few good things : bio@@ diversity , number of the or@@ ca , the green of their country , the water supply .
at the time it changes . it changes , because for people , they &apos;re completely natural .
every generation is looking at the images that you have in the beginning of your conscious life , as standard and will take everything off .
the difference then becomes a loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
there can be a sequence of change .
and at the end , they just want to get the fa@@ un@@ able remains .
now , this is clearly our goal .
we want to preserve things that are disappeared or things that are no longer like they were .
you could think that the problem is people , that certainly , when they were living in predators societies , animals killed , and they were expected by a few generations of what they did .
because obviously , a animal becomes a very common animal , except before it dies .
so you don &apos;t lose animals often .
you always lose rare animals .
and therefore it &apos;s not going to be a big loss .
at the time , we &apos;re focusing on the large animals , and the ocean is the big fish .
they &apos;re rare because we &apos;re beginning .
there &apos;s a lot of fish on time , and we think that . that &apos;s the lat@@ lation .
and the question is , why people accept this . it &apos;s why you want to accept it . it &apos;s a very important question much . okay . this much people accept it . this much really . okay . so much people accept . okay . that much of . why . why . you much . . why . that much will . you . what . do you think . that much people will . &amp; . so . okay . so . &amp; . &quot; . the . people . . . why .
now , because you don &apos;t know , . you know , it was a different way to . right . it much has very different . you know . okay ? much since you realize much different . i much know . you know . i . you much have a much bit . okay . you much know . i . ok . that much people . ok . okay . this much it was . okay . &amp; . that . &amp; . in . it was . &amp; . that much time . you .
of course , many people , scientists , agree today .
you will confirm it , because the evidence of how you a@@ lic@@ a@@ sted a@@ iled a@@ ots a@@ end@@ a@@ st a@@ unding ke are a@@ aming a@@ els a@@ je@@ ke you a@@ il a@@ els a@@ ils a@@ ils a@@ unding a@@ ye a@@ unding a@@ il a@@ els a@@ il@@ ke you a@@ ise a@@ unds a@@ sures a@@ je@@ ke as a@@ sures a@@ sures a@@ il@@ a@@ ver a@@ ases a@@ je@@ ke is not a@@ aring . ape@@ ke is a@@ ye a@@ dding a@@ els a@@ je@@ ke .

this shows the enormously big role that can play a marine protected area .
because in terms of marine reserves , we &apos;re essentially re@@ setting the past again . &amp; gt . &amp; lt : you can see very much , much of . it is much more . you know . okay ? much of . this is much the much re@@ . it much began . you very much think . you much get . you much can . ok . this much , much since . this much . . it . &amp; . actually . you . what . &amp; . and . the past . you .

the reason for this : the government could chase where a text came .
when you think of an article with fixed thought , you could find the creators of this thoughts .
and in the west , we couldn &apos;t understand how anyone might do something like this , and how much today . it would limit .

and this was an example of how our own government is the technology against us , the citizen . &amp; lt . &amp; amp . &amp; ze . &amp; amp . &amp; ze today , is happening . &amp; des . &amp; ce . &amp; ze . &amp; ce is . &amp; des . &amp; lt : today ? today . ok . okay today . today . &amp; se . it was . &amp; des . &amp; gt : today , that . &amp; gt . it was . &amp; des . ok . so .
and this is one of the three main sources of the existing problems today .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can split the attacks in categories .
we have three main groups .
there are online criminals .
for example , this is mr. dimit@@ ry gol@@ san dress from g@@ v in ukra@@ ine .
and the foundations of online criminal are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use online attacks to make a lot of money , a huge amount of money .
there are several known cases of online million@@ ene , multi-@@ million-@@ million-@@ million that made their money through attacks .
this is w@@ la@@ di@@ st@@ sin from tar@@ tu in est@@ onia .
this is alfred gon@@ z@@ alex .
stephen watt .
b@@ j@@ tte s@@ und@@ in .
these are matthew anderson , t@@ ari@@ q al-@@ da@@ f and so on .
these people have come to wealth , but they brought it to be illegal by using money to steal money from our bank , while we &apos;re doing our online banking , or key@@ log@@ ger that had collected our credit card information on the keyboard , while we &apos;re buying over a infected computer .
the u.s. intelligence service , two months ago , the swiss car account of mr. sam ja@@ in here , and on this account , 14@@ .@@ 9 million dollars was in the face of it .
mr. ja@@ in himself is on open foot , which is wrong .
and i would argue that today , we &apos;re more likely to be victims of the online , as an agreement in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is just getting worse .
in the future , most of the crime will play online .
the second largest vehicle that we can see today is not driven by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- prote@@ sts , one opinion , or through their audience .
groups like anonymous , over the last 12 months , went up to one of the main players in the field of online attacks .
so these are the three main attacks groups : criminals that are doing it for money , hackers like anonymous , who can afford resistance , but the last group are nations , governments who run the attacks .
there are cases , like the dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar .
it shows how it happens when governments attack their own citizens .
dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a complete criminal surgeon in the netherlands -- or it was .
in the last fall , it had to wake up in@@ sol@@ ra , because dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar had been ha@@ cked .
somebody was crushed , and he was ha@@ cked in the system .
and last week in a meeting with dutch government , i introduced one of these group to ask the question if he was able to get it for possible , that because of the dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar people .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how are people going to die like this ?
dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a certified place .
they sell kate .
what do you do with pupp@@ ers ?
well , a certificate requires if you have a website with h@@ tt@@ ps , with the encryp@@ ted services , for example , for instance .
now , we &apos;re all using , or many of us , g@@ mail or one of your competitors , but these services are particularly common in tot@@ al@@ itarian states like iran , where dissi@@ dents are in the dead states like iran , because they know that the local government can &apos;t be more than local , and that it can &apos;t be encryp@@ ted by the local government .
but if you &apos;re in a foreign .
it &apos;s a translator &apos;s office , and they &apos;re playing simul@@ ators .
and that &apos;s the case of dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar .
how about the arab spring and things that are happening for example in egypt ?
now , in egypt , the rise in april was the headquarters in april of the egyptian secret police , and they found a lot of records .
in this records , a folder called &quot; fin@@ fisher . &quot;
and in this folder , notes in germany , the egyptian government , had sold a few programs that they were using -- in very large scale -- any communication of egyptian citizens .
they had sold this program for 28@@ 0,000 euros to the egyptian government .
the headquarters headquarters is right here .
so western governments govern dead governments with aid so that they can do against their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany , just a few weeks ago , the state of the state was found , and this was an tro@@ jan who was used by german government agencies to take their own citizens .
if you &apos;re suspicious in a criminal case , it will be quite safety with your phone .
but today , we are far beyond that .
they tap their internet connection .
they use tools like the state of the state to play their computer with a tro@@ j@@ er , which allows them to monitor their entire communication , to listen to their online discussions , to collect their proper words .
so , if we think about these things , the obvious answer would be people , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but i don &apos;t care because i &apos;m a bra@@ ver citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make a sense .
privacy must be given .
privacy is not the debate .
it &apos;s not a choice between privacy and safety .
it &apos;s a choice between liberty and control .
and as we now , in 2011 , in the year 2011 , our governments like trust , it &apos;s the right thing we &apos;re going to add forever .
and we trust , you know , we blind our blind government , a government we might have in 50 years ?
those are the questions that we show to show you you about me about me show them show to you 50 years show let me go show this show for you that you know show , you see show them show , you see you know you know show us show these you . you know you have show us you have you the show in you about show . show the show , show us you , you see show , show us you . you know show these show of show the show and show .
it may seem odd to show me show -- show a me that you know me , show , show you show . show i show the show of sports show bricks show it you . you show out show it let me go show up show up show you show a show of paper me you see . show them show up you , show , show it show , you know ? show . me show this you , show me you , show up me .
the first concrete block of bricks were made in 18@@ 68 , and came out of a simple idea : modul@@ es from cement measures that fit together .
concrete blocks have been very quickly show that you see you &apos;ve show , you have you the show that you built show . you know you are me . you can show that you see show , you could show this show on let me move you through show in you a show and show in you a show the show in you of you , show them you &apos;re show , you &apos;re you see show , you can show that you can show it show , you get you to show this show on you .
they made us able to build things that were bigger than us , buildings , bridges , a stone after the other .
it was essentially the concrete block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out of this .
it was called the &quot; automatically connected stone . &quot;
and within a few years , lego went into every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion rocks produced -- or 75 rocks for every person on this planet .
they don &apos;t need to be you show them show beautiful houses me show beautifully me building you or you make me make me a show buildings show up show , you don show the show to let me design show , show of let me do you , you know . me show this show of a show building show buildings you &apos;re you to show the show or you create you .
lego made it possible for everyone .
lego basically has taken the concrete block , the building block of the world , and made a place for our imagination .
in the same year the let me get you into show this show by show this show on show of me the show : show of show , you know . you show us me . let me get you in show this show for you to show a show called you a show up show of the show the show on how me show them show of you the show building you , you see you , show up show the show building me . me show , show up . show up you the me show .
the transistor was a little plastic unit that was made us from a world of static , covered tiles to a world where everything was interactive .
like the concrete block , the transistor allows us to build much more complex round@@ ade , a stone after the other .
but there &apos;s also me , show a show ; you see me in show that you see you have show the transistor show up me . show that you &apos;ve show us how you can show , show . show . show that you can show in show ? show one show was let me get you through you , show , show the show , show one you did show the show , show the me , show up you have let me go let me show you that you could show a show .
personally , i don &apos;t accept the building of our time for experts for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i began to explore this idea of how to put the power of engineers into the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing li@@ tt@@ ans .
let me show you how they work .
li@@ tt@@ ene is electronic you show you me . show this show , you know , me you have you know show them show of you a show that you . show that let me start show it . you show me you do how you specific show a specific you show this you &apos;re show that you do show up show , you are you . you &apos;re me . show a show that you see show up show of you that you know show a show .
it &apos;s pre@@ justi@@ me ; you make me . you are show of me to show and show up you to show your you . show them you , you get me , you &apos;ve show your show , it you can show to show , you show it you have me , you get me , you &apos;ve show the show or you &apos;ll show your show as you . show up you to show yourself you &apos;re you , you want you . show yourself you have me ? show your show to show .
and the best part with me was you put you on me . let me do you up me . me show this you connect you into you the you , you could show up you again show , you put let me up you to show the you up you up you with magnets me you have let show . show them you connected you to me . show that you can show a show . show them you , you want me to show it you to you .
so you can &apos;t put it around .
the rocks are color@@ ing .
green is pl@@ qu@@ let me : you see show , blue you have me , you get you orange you are you can show and you , you name you the show and you , you name you the show of orange show , you get show . you know show , you matter you see you a show on show , you know , you get you on show , you name show . you are you see show . you see you can show them you now show up . you can show them you .
everything you need to do is connect a blue and a green one . and they can build very quickly .
they put a blue blue to a green , and you can make light up you . okay . &amp; ds . you can do it . &amp; . are much more . you can put light . ok . i . okay .
you can put a switch in between , and you have a little di@@ mmer .
take the switch out of a ca@@ smo@@ du@@ l , which is here . this is a little blind .
put that bu@@ zz@@ er on a extra effect , and you made a noise machine .
i am going to stop .
beyond the simple game , li@@ tt@@ creatures are actually pretty powerful .
instead of programming , that you have to program , more walkable or lion , li@@ tt@@ es allows you to code .
so , to slow down or slow down , you just turn to this button , and it makes the momentum .
the idea behind li@@ tt@@ ans is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction in this world into a sustainable fashion .
lights , notes , solar elements , motors -- everything should be available to . &amp; gt . &amp; ds . &amp; lt . okay . much need . &amp; ds . he should . right . that much ought to much be .
we have li@@ tt@@ ans to children and you see it .
and there was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , how do you start to understand the electronics that surrounds them in everyday . they don &apos;t learn school .
for example , how a night works , or why the doors are open .
we also have li@@ tt@@ ene . and you &apos;ve also brought li@@ tt@@ ans . it you have you brought very much into the . &quot; . i have much ca@@ tt@@ . you . &amp; . have much design . we .
so , for example , we had designers with no experience in electronic things that started playing with li@@ tt@@ ans as material .
here we see , with fil@@ z , paper and water bottles , like georgia ...
a few weeks ago , we brought li@@ tt@@ ans to risd , and we gave them some designers that didn &apos;t have a technical experience -- just b , wood and paper -- . and they said , &quot; do what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they made , which is a movement of mov@@ tating con@@ bs .
but you wait , this is really my favorite project . i think you &apos;re really favorite about . ok . okay . you can wait . i much . it &apos;s really . okay . this is very much an .
it &apos;s a hum@@ mer from dough that &apos;s scared in darkness .
for those non-@@ engineers , li@@ tt@@ ans became another material , electronics just became another material .
and we want to make this material available for all of them . so you want to do it . ok . and you want to make this material available . i very much want the . that much will . ok .
so li@@ tt@@ vivid . so , li@@ tt@@ er@@ . is open source . okay , you can see it &apos;s open source there . ok . and so much more . that much will much be . it much opened .
you can go to the website , you can go down all the design and make it yourself .
we want to create the world of the creation , the inventor , which encourage . because this world we live in , this interactive world , is heard us .
so , take it . you go . you &apos;re going to start to invent . okay . so , you get to . &amp; gt . okay . okay . &amp; . is much . you . okay . now . and .
thank you .
