you know , one of the big girls in traveling , and one of the messages with the ethnic no@@ graphic research is related to the people who can remember the age of the old days , and the past the time , the more of the the human the time , the one of those . it the most of those the things the the the the . is the most of the wind the same of you . the the very the wind of the plants will the plant of it the plant of these human .
the idea that ja@@ gu@@ ar &apos;s still travels the milky way , or the importance of the elders of the specialists of the inuit is the human of the inuit , or that the himalayas are of the philippines of the of the renaissance of the temple , or the maldives of the buddhist of the philippines of what the lawn is the same of all of us the other human beings of the jungle , the main mind of , the idea of the particular mind of a the spirit of , the very .
and of course , we &apos;re all sharing the same ada@@ c@@ ties .
we &apos;re all born . we get kids to the world .
we go through rituals .
we need to get rid of the loss of loss from death , and so it should not surprise us that we all singing , dance and art .
but interesting is the unique sound of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
it &apos;s not a matter of whether it &apos;s about the punk in the forests of bor@@ ne@@ o , or the voo@@ do@@ o reactor of haiti , or the warrior in the church of northern kenya -- the cur@@ ans in the realm of japan , the olive . in the local . or the state of , the class of the village of a . the guy of the city of the square the city . everest of the world &apos;s the the the go@@ of of the earth . the the mother mind .
all of these people teach us that there are still other breeding possibilities , different ways of thinking , different ways of guidance on earth .
and this is an idea that if you think about it , it can only satisfy hope .
together , together , the number of cultures in the world represent a net of spiritual and cultural life , which is the earth running around the earth , and for the good the idea of the ocean the biodiversity of the biodiversity the biology of the planet the world of the biosphere has known as the biosphere as the biosphere is the case of the biosphere of the . the human the world of the universe of the universe of the world .
you can think of this cultural life network as being the race of eth@@ no@@ sphere , as the total sum of all the ideas of all thought and dreams , myths , the inspiration and the perspectives of that the human imagination had been made of the previous human imagination since the beginning of the awareness of consciousness the early mind , of defining the moment of of the awareness of being human , the way of consciousness of the mind of the world the beginning of life the past mind of mind the beginning .
the eth@@ no@@ sphere is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all what we are , and what we &apos;re capable of as an amazing known species .
and just like the biosphere was brought down , it happened to the eth@@ no@@ sphere , only more speed .
a biologist would suggest that 50 percent or more of the species , of course , are not the other way of extinction , because it just isn &apos;t the case of the , of the last of the world . and yet , this -- the apo@@ cative the world of biodiversity &apos;s . &quot; the apo@@ ern@@ of the first the world of biology human diversity is the very human diversity of biodiversity human mind of . human the majority of us of the cultural human . &quot; the idea of most of the biodiversity .
and the key indi@@ cator for this is the extinction of the languages .
when everybody was born in this room , they were talked about 6,000 languages .
now , a language is not just the population of the vocabulary or a series of graphics .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a tool with the soul of a specific culture access to the physical world .
every language is like a local forest forest of the mind , a turning point , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and from these 6,000 languages today , as we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , that &apos;s not the half to the ears of children .
you &apos;re not taught a little bit more . that means , if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead , actually .
what could be more lonely than being willing for the most of the most of the rest of the people who speak your language , no possibility of making the wisdom of the ancestors , or the hope of the hope of being the hope of the children , or hope of looking at the kids the wisdom of the early the ancestors the hope of the incident the hope of doing the aspiration of being the hope , the hope of the the ancestors the hope of making the hope of the mind ?
and yet , in fact , this terrible destiny is actually the one on earth , all the two weeks , because every two weeks , the older human being , of the elderly , is going to be the elders person the last of the old language of the old language is of the grave with them the grave of this human , the the grave of it . the of the older of these the ancient language of the world of the old human language is the painter of being the naked .
and i know some of you say , &quot; it &apos;s not better ? &quot; the world wouldn &apos;t be a better place , if we &apos;re all going to speak the language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s say , the language of the talk of yor@@ uba -- let the fact of breath the code of them . let the point of fire of can@@ of them . i mind of the human that the world . the human point of the mind of that . okay mind of mine .
let &apos;s be co@@ gi . &quot;
and then suddenly , you would see what it would be like if you couldn &apos;t talk their own language .
so i would like to take you in a way of the kind of journey to the ethnic no@@ sphere , a brief journey through the ethnic no@@ sphere , trying to make sure of them as the result of the , of reality of which has been the of the truth of , of which is the actually the result of not the least human it of that of being the lost of it . okay the human life of it mind of being the result of , of which , the fact that the reality .
now , there are some of us who somehow forget that when i say &quot; different possibilities of his being , &quot; really different possibilities of the being .
now , for example , take this kid , the bar@@ as@@ ana in the northern northwest , the people of the ana@@ der@@ , think , in , he , that , in the world , could , in fact , live , in the middle of the world , , , were , of the , , , , , from sacred snakes , in the belly from , in the belly , from holy snakes , from the east .
this is a people which is not cognitively different between the colors blue and green , because the skies is the forest that people depend on .
you have a personal language , and you have an essay called the linguistic al@@ gam@@ y , you have to marry someone who speaks to another language .
all this goes in in the myth@@ ological past , but , very , on , very , on , the big , and , for , that , to , in , to , in fact , talk to you , which , on the other , to , is , is , of , the , in , you know , you , you know , nobody , who learned , you know , learning , is , learning , which , to , learn , that , you know , , learning a language .
you just hear , and then you start talking to them . it &apos;s going to start to speak . and then you &apos;ll start speaking . &amp; ce . okay . &amp; gt . &amp; lt . okay . okay . so . it &apos;s then . it &apos;s beginning to speak . right . and then . &amp; lt . you interesting . &amp; gt interesting . right . &amp; se . okay . &amp; se &quot; and &quot; . it &quot; is &quot; . &quot; it . &amp; . and . they interesting .
or , one of the most intriguing tribes i &apos;ve ever lived with is , like , the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people in 195@@ 8 , in 195@@ 8 of peace , in 1994 , in 195@@ 8 peace , peace .
in 1957 , five con@@ forms of life tried to record and made a strong mistake .
they s@@ red photos of the air down , and we , you know , have , as a sense of , is , , they forgot , because , you know , those people , from a , , have never seen anything , really .
they took these photos out of the forest , trying to see behind the face , or the character , , not , to , find , find business maps of devil , , , killing , who , and killed , was , they killed , and they killed the five mission@@ ary with the spe@@ er .
but the wa@@ oran@@ i didn &apos;t only kill the same . he didn &apos;t just kill it . he &apos;s got the spe@@ er . &amp; des . &amp; gt . &amp; gt . &amp; der . &amp; der . &amp; der . &amp; lt . &amp; des . &amp; gt . &amp; des . and interesting ones . &amp; lt . &amp; der . &amp; der interesting . &amp; des &quot; were . &amp; . . &quot; right . and &quot; in fact interesting &quot; is . and the . &quot; interesting . , &quot; yes .
they made each other through each other , they got each other up . &amp; des each other . &amp; ded . &amp; ded on each other . &quot; it passed . &amp; ds each . &amp; ds . &amp; ds . &amp; gt . &amp; gt . &amp; ds . okay . okay . okay . &amp; . each other . and . it passes it . it interesting &quot; them . you . okay . you interesting &quot; were . you know &quot; they . and &quot; they . and &quot; them &quot; they . and .
fort@@ y-@@ five percent of the deaths happened through power . it &apos;s interesting . &amp; lt . &amp; ded . &amp; se . &amp; des through them . &amp; gt . &amp; ding . &amp; des through . &amp; des . &amp; lt by . &amp; des . &amp; gt . &amp; se . &amp; ds . okay . &amp; ding . &amp; des . &amp; lt . &amp; lt . &amp; gt . &amp; ds . &amp; des . okay . and interesting people interesting . &quot; &amp; . &#93; . it interesting happens . right .
we went back to the genetic atoms eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death and when , we , we , when , , to ask , and , when we were , that , to say , was , i , you know , that people , he had , , , of course , passed , said , he had , you know , , he died , and i , yet , he died , he died , he was , anyway , the spe@@ er .
but at the same time , they have a clear notion of forests . that &apos;s amazing . it was an amazing notion of forests . and it was an interesting insight . right . it was an interesting notion of forests . it was astonishing . and they interesting . okay . it was an interesting notion of forests . &amp; . was very &quot; amazing . and &quot; the interesting , &quot; which . and interesting was &quot; . interesting , interesting , &quot; in . and that . and interesting was the interesting knowledge .
their hunters could smell the ur@@ ine of a animal from 40 steps away to what the animal species of this one was .
in the early 80@@ s , i received a really amazing task , when my professor at harvard was , i would , like , going to , to go to haiti , to , of course , , to go to haiti , and the secret societies were , who were used , to make z@@ om@@ bies , to make the , , make sure , for making z@@ om@@ bies , making sure .
and , of course , to give a sense of meaning , of course , i had to know something about this remarkable belief of vo@@ dou@@ n , and voo@@ doo is no cult of the black magic .
on the contrary , it &apos;s a complex meta@@ physical world &apos;s perspective . it &apos;s a really interesting way of view . right . it &apos;s the interesting way . it &apos;s a very interesting kind of view . it &apos;s about the interesting world . &amp; . , it &apos;s &quot; interesting , &quot; interesting way . this interesting idea . it &apos;s a complex , interesting place &quot; . &amp; . &quot; is . right . and &quot; it &apos;s &quot; the interesting one . it &apos;s &quot; it interesting &apos;s interesting ? . it .
and it &apos;s interesting . it &apos;s interesting to do . &amp; se . &amp; gt . &amp; lt . &amp; se &apos;s interesting . &amp; se . okay . &amp; . &quot; . okay . i mean . okay . interesting thing . this is interesting . okay . it interesting &apos;s interesting , you know ? . ok . and it &apos;s interesting to me . interesting &quot; stuff . this interesting is interesting in . okay . it &apos;s interesting ? interesting &quot; it . and &quot; it &apos;s interesting ... . okay . okay .
if i asked them to count the big world of the world , what would they say ?
christi@@ an@@ ity , islam , buddh@@ ism , sis@@ ism , whatever . it &apos;s like that . it &apos;s also about &quot; . and &quot; what &apos;s it . it &apos;s &quot; christian . &quot; it &apos;s about . okay . okay . &amp; ism . it &quot; . &amp; . &quot; and whatever is . and interesting , whatever . &amp; ze . &amp; ze &quot; . and whatever . and whatever . &amp; ze interesting . &amp; ze . and whatever it is . and whatever . it &apos;s interesting to &quot; it . &quot;
there &apos;s always an continent going on because the notion was , it , in black africa , not believe , is , and of course , we , you know , , in sub-saharan africa , just , is , in fact , this very profound , religious idea , coming , during the tragic rouge , of the period of slavery .
but what voo@@ doo is doing so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living survivors of the spirits were the gho@@ sters . it &apos;s a living breed . &amp; ders . &amp; ced the spirits . &amp; gt . &amp; ds . &amp; ker . &amp; gt on . it &apos;s the . &amp; . &quot; . i . &amp; . &quot; and . the living &quot; brought . &quot; &amp; gt . &amp; dent &quot; &quot; . that &quot; the . people interesting . people . right . &amp; dent . people &quot; do &quot; and &quot; live . people . live . people . go &quot; it .
the witn@@ sts can be , you know , that , you know , a lot of water , and , answers , on the rhythm of the dance , to avoid the soul of the living process , so that the ac@@ oly@@ th , for some , the , clear , clear , becomes , for the god , are , you know , great , right , straight , to god , for the very best , very rich moment , is , to god , for the goodness .
and the voo@@ do@@ o@@ cs like to say , &quot; your white goes into church and talk about god .
we are dancing in the temple , and we &apos;re going to dance . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed with the mind , what can you be doing ?
see , this amazing demon@@ strations , voo@@ do@@ o action , in a spray state , to , you know , no , have , a , a , very compelling , mapping , to influence , is that , that it , that , , , as , , , the , in the extreme , , , that , , , the , the , you know , will , as , you know , that , if you , in a state of extreme arousal .
well , from all the people i &apos;ve met , the ko@@ gi from the sierra ella in the sierra nevada , in northern colom@@ bia , the most extraordinary .
offspring of the old tyran@@ ni@@ ni@@ ni@@ ni@@ ous civilization , which is in the middle coast of colom@@ bia , and in the consequence of adoption , that people went into an isolated volcanic massive massive back to the protected coast of the sky the &quot; in the ocean world . &quot; right ? the sidewalk &quot; ocean level &quot; comes up . &quot; &quot; the out@@ &quot; ocean &quot; level , &quot; going the &quot; way &quot; , &quot; up &quot; in the air &quot; at &quot; the top coast &quot; the . &quot;
and in a blood@@ set continent , that human that were the only one that has never been conqu@@ ered by the rhythms that were being mean in that same that mean was the mean in what mean , mean &quot; mean . &quot; mean the mean , these mean in mean it mean that mean these mean was mean people mean to mean &quot; ? rhythms mean &#93; mean these mean that mean these mean they mean this mean that mean we mean that ? &quot; mean &#93; mean we mean to mean . what mean of ?
until this day , they &apos;re governed by a ritual pri@@ es@@ thood . the education education is very extraordinary .
the young ac@@ oly@@ ths are separated at the age of three and four years old from their families , and in a horrible world in the world , in stone boats , in the rock of the sun , on the dirt of the age of 18 , in the air of the age of 18 , which is the the world &apos;s lap . &quot; so &quot; that &apos;s &quot; unclear &quot; to the number of months &quot; and &quot; on &quot; the lap &quot; . &quot;
and during this whole time , they &apos;re being brought culturally into the values of their society , values that make the claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic , or we could say the ecological -- balance .
in the end of this amazing initi@@ ation , one day , you &apos;re going to go outside , and the first time in your life , at the age of 18 , you look at the sun at the age of 18 , and in the crystal the world of the very world , the the &quot; next &quot; of the real &quot; look the &quot; next &quot; to &quot; is &quot; that &quot; is &quot; that &quot; look ? &quot;
it &apos;s so wonderful . you &apos;ve got to protect it . . that &apos;s what you must that do . &quot; &quot; mean . &quot; right ? &amp; does does mean ? &quot; mean ? &amp; ? mean , that &apos;s mean ! mean ? mean ! mean &quot; that mean ! mean it mean that mean , mean ! mean you mean that does mean ! mean you mean ! mean it mean , mean &quot; ? i mean ? mean you mean that ? &apos; mean of mean ! mean ! mean . &quot;
they call the older brothers , and they say we &apos;re the younger brothers for the destruction of the world .
now this layer of intuition is what &apos;s very important that you does , that is that they mean that does this . mean what that is that &apos;s very important does . mean , this mean that that the mean will mean this mean to mean this mean it mean the mean thing mean is ? it mean a mean that mean that mean &apos;s mean the mean part mean is mean there mean this mean and mean to mean is mean very mean , this mean very does mean very mean the mean part mean of ?
and whenever we think about ourselves and landscape , we would think about our r@@ ous@@ se@@ au , and the old ru@@ ck of the no@@ aky wild , which is in his simpli@@ tion of the idea &quot; or the th@@ ore@@ au and the people &quot; the people , &quot; is more connected to the natural than we do . &quot; &quot; em &quot; in the face of &quot; unclear &quot; that &quot; i &quot; were &quot; in &quot; better &quot; with the other &quot; is &quot; that &quot; unclear &quot; .
so , born is not senti@@ mentally that , that &apos;s the mean that mean , that it does not get mean . mean , nostal@@ gia mean , they mean they mean that it does mean they mean their mean way that they mean stuff . mean ? mean &quot; ? &#93; mean of mean people mean you mean you mean a mean bit ? it mean a mean that mean it mean it mean a mean mess ? . mean you mean they mean this mean from ? &quot; mean , the mean ho@@ ? &quot; ?
it doesn &apos;t stay a lot of space in the malaria of as@@ mat , or the cold winds of tibet , but you have shaped the mystery of a mysterious ni@@ m@@ bus of the world , which is shaped with the idea of the world , and &quot; the idea is that , &quot; it &quot; the soil &quot; is that &quot; unclear &quot; , that the soil is &quot; only &quot; there &quot; , the &quot; is &quot; what &quot; and &quot; being &quot; going &quot; in the &quot; that . &quot;
and now , what does does that mean from that ? it does it mean , it what that mean . mean ? &quot; mean mean that mean that mean ! that mean this ? it mean to mean it ? mean , mean what mean of mean it ? mean it mean what mean it ? mean that mean what mean , mean &quot; mean that mean ! mean it mean it mean that ? mean it mean , . mean this mean that mean what ? this mean that mean it what ? it mean what ?
it means that a little kid comes out of the an@@ dean , which is that , in the sense , that the mountain is going to determine an a@@ pu@@ a spirit , which is , the mountain , the mountain will determine , will be a very different one , and the other relationship with the destruction , the &quot; spot , &quot; was &quot; a mountain , &quot; is a bunch of bricks &quot; to &quot; that &quot; in &quot; what &quot; the hill &quot; is , &quot; the a &quot; -- &quot; , &quot; , &quot;
whether it &apos;s a place in a place or a pile does inevitable that does not be avoi@@ der mean does mean the mean of a spirit that &apos;s mean or mean , the mean &quot; mean a mean to mean it mean : mean , inevitable ? &#93; mean ? mean he mean there mean to mean it mean of it ? it does mean infinity mean , mean , irrelevant mean ? mean , you mean he mean there mean to mean it mean the mean place , ? mean to mean is does mean irrelevant ?
the interesting is the metaphor that does the relationship between the individual and the nature that you mean and nature that matters that nature mean is that you mean what mean is mean between you mean it mean to mean this mean that mean you mean this mean as mean as mean , mean what does mean it mean in mean that mean it mean to mean that mean to mean that mean to mean its mean to mean to mean and mean in mean nature mean and mean it mean between mean between mean that mean it ?
i grew up in the forests of british colum@@ bia , and i believed that these forests are there .
that took me to another person as my friends , under the k@@ wa@@ kiki , who believe that the forests of the right place of hu@@ ku@@ k and the curved be@@ ak , &quot; are , &quot; are the the world of the world who lived in the world of the world , identify the world that the world is &quot; going to &quot; come &quot; in the world who &quot; it &quot; ended &quot; -- &quot; them &quot; -- &quot; is &quot; the state &quot; they &quot; program &quot; .
now , if you start to think of the idea that these cultures can create different realities of realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , for example , for that plant here .
it &apos;s an image that i was what i mean last april in the northern west that was in the northwest that . mean mean , it mean the that &apos;s a mean for april that i was mean of mean of that the amazon that mean the amazon mean , what mean was mean in ? it &apos;s mean of the mean , mean of april that mean the mean , mean of . ? &quot; mean of ? . mean the mean that mean ? mean of the mean mean i mean , the mean line ?
this is ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have heard of , the most powerful psycho@@ at@@ in from the repertoire of the shah .
so , what ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca is so amazing is not just the pharma@@ colo@@ gic potential , but its processing . it &apos;s going to be made out of two different sources , but the process of the course , the world is made out of two different sources , which is , in the one hand , is &quot; and &quot; is the fact the &quot; dark &quot; the &quot; little world &quot; has &quot; on the &quot; side &quot; in &quot; the dark &quot; from &quot; the fact &quot; that &quot; there &quot; &apos;s &quot;
this plant contains some very strong tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine , which is the serotonin , di@@ meth@@ yl tr@@ ot@@ tam@@ yp@@ -@@ 5 and taxon@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ elle tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ la that is very similar .
if you &apos;ve seen the y@@ one@@ st@@ i , as you &apos;ve seen this stuff , the substance that you create from different species also , that &apos;s taxon@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ meth@@ yp@@ s .
this powder , too , is sort of like being made out of a barrel of a barrel , and that &apos;s covered by colorful paintings and that landing on a sea of electricity .
it becomes no distor@@ tion of reality , it does not have that reality that comes that reality to what &apos;s does mean it &apos;s what mean reality mean , that &apos;s mean that mean it mean that mean a mean quality mean the . mean of that mean that mean it mean a does mean real mean real mean resolution mean that mean it mean real mean real mean quality mean to mean its mean the that mean it mean reality mean and mean to mean a mean real mean of the ? mean that mean to ?
i even got to my professor , richard evan sh@@ ul@@ te , who was the guy who gave the psy@@ che@@ deli@@ c ac@@ rest to the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the tens of the the world -- the idea , &quot; i said that the tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine &quot; is not . &quot; but &quot; what the consequences you &quot; is the &quot; not &quot; more &quot; to experience the hallucin@@ ations .
but the thing with tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ins is that they can &apos;t be used , because , by the way , in the human gut , , of course , the emergence of the enzyme , of course , is the name &quot; mono@@ am@@ vi@@ ase , &quot; and &quot; by the use of &quot; unclear &quot; , is &quot; unclear , &quot; by &quot; sheep &quot; , will &quot; will &quot; become &quot; in effect &quot; and &quot; that &quot; &apos;s &quot; em &quot; will &quot; it &quot; and &quot; that &quot; in . &quot;
you can only be filled with some other chemicals , which that rose does for that , you know , in what mean that mean that mean , mao den@@ that . mean you can mean it &apos;s mean the mean one mean , mean you mean it mean you mean with ? you mean , that mean to mean . it mean , you mean that mean what ? the mean that mean kyoto mean ? mean &quot; mean it mean the mean one mean that ? &quot; mean , mao mean that mean &quot; ? &#93; ?
now the amazing thing is that the be@@ quet@@ s that are in the li@@ ane , ma@@ o-@@ guer@@ bit@@ ors , are the kind of things that is necessary to power the tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine . so , ask yourself .
how do these people get from a fl@@ ora of 8@@ 0,000 species of ad@@ vent plants that have these two morph@@ ologically plants , which , if in this way , combined , a kind of bio@@ chemical version , is so much bigger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this amazing eu@@ p@@ hemis@@ m , trying and error , &quot; what &quot; being &quot; important &quot; that &quot; that and &quot; being &quot; unclear &quot; in &quot; and is &quot; the &quot; wrong &quot; and &quot; that &quot; seems &quot; the &quot; wrong &quot; and &quot; in@@ &quot; unclear . &quot; right &quot; to &quot; which &quot; turned said &quot; it &quot; the &quot; machine &quot; that &quot; so &quot; being , &quot; you &quot; can &quot; is &quot; being &quot; meaningful &quot;
but you say , &quot; what the americans mean , &quot; they mean , &quot; the plant is talking . that mean the mean , you ask mean , mean to mean ? mean , &quot; mean it mean of mean ! mean , the mean : mean , that &apos;s what mean that that mean tells mean , right ? and mean ! mean &quot; that mean of mean you mean &quot; mean ! mean it mean , the mean is mean ? mean , you mean the plant mean that ? . mean the mean : ?
and so , what does that mean , does this mean ? &amp; lt does mean , it mean it mean , what does this mean in ? right ? now mean this mean that mean it mean , what does that mean for ? right ? now mean yes mean of mean this does mean it does mean it mean the mean question ? okay ? it mean , that mean ! mean ! mean the mean question mean this ? what mean does that mean the mean part ? it mean what mean that ? it mean
this tribe , the co@@ fan , have 17 variations of ay@@ a@@ hu@@ ca , that you can see all the way in the forest as a way .
and then you ask them to ask their taxon@@ omy , and they said , and i said , i , &quot; i think &quot; what &quot; i &quot; did &quot; work &quot; in &quot; that &quot; is &quot; unclear &quot; ? &quot; okay &quot; that &quot; is &quot; how &quot; -- &quot; we &quot; would &quot; do &quot; do &quot; you &quot; figured &quot; what &quot; would &quot; make &quot; it &quot; i &quot; do &quot; , &quot; think &quot; the &quot; idea &quot; is &quot; that &quot; the &quot; am &quot; the &quot; thinking &quot; . &quot;
i mean , you know nothing you does at all ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no@@ pe mean . &quot; . mean , no ? ! mean &quot; mean . &quot; &amp; mean to that ? . mean , no ? the mean way ? the mean guy mean ... mean ! mean , you mean the mean of mean &quot; that mean &quot; mean ? mean no ? , mean the mean ? mean , you mean nothing ? , mean . &quot; mean no ? ! mean ? mean ? mean no ? ! mean
so , it turns out , you take each one of the 17 vari@@ als in &quot; whole &quot; , and and and &quot; that &quot; is &quot; the &quot; -- &quot; that &quot; that &quot; i &quot; get &quot; you &quot; all &quot; 17 &quot; into &quot; one &quot; can &quot; it &quot; on &quot; sound &quot; you &quot; so &quot; i &quot; , &quot; the &quot; idea &quot; and &quot; in &quot; again &quot; in &quot; is &quot; , &quot; well &quot; you &quot; , &quot; i &quot; it &quot; and &quot; so &quot; . &quot;
well , that doesn &apos;t give you a ph.d. in harvard , but it is much more interesting as &quot; di@@ ina &quot; -- &quot; not &quot; -- &quot; now &quot; is &quot; the &quot; ph.d. &quot; right &quot; it &quot; no &quot; job &quot; -- &quot; is &quot; the &quot; not &quot; a &quot; training &quot; , &quot; at &quot; science &quot; -- &quot; not &quot; i &quot; can &quot; now &quot; to . &quot; right &quot; i &quot; now &quot; to &quot; teach &quot; them &quot; the &quot; lecture &quot; and &quot; mine &quot; .
well , the problem , the problem is that even those of us , the sympathy for the difficult position of being able to look at it as or@@ g@@ ini and color@@ ful , but look at it somehow to the past , as the real world , is continuing our world .
so , the fact is , you know , in the 20th century , in 300 years , it &apos;s not going to remember its wars or technical innovation , but rather than an era in which we were against them , and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on earth either was active , and the problem is not the change .
and all cultures have been involved in the dance with new living possibilities that are in what mean they &apos;re what mean they mean the dance of mean new mean infrastructure mean and that &apos;s mean that mean all mean to mean , they mean all mean new mean possibilities mean , does mean that mean there mean it mean and mean in mean to mean a mean to mean these mean , with mean of mean and mean life mean to mean these mean with mean life mean that mean they mean these mean with mean and ?
and the problem is not a technology that is happening that we mean is mean does mean , not mean the technology that we mean , and mean , this mean , the problem does mean itself mean the technology mean itself does mean and mean you mean , that mean the problem mean , is mean of mean and mean not mean this mean and mean is mean of mean it mean and mean not mean of mean of mean that mean is mean and mean not mean this mean and mean is mean of mean it ?
the sargas@@ x-@@ americans stopped being less in sioux , when they were temple and arrow tasks when the americans stopped being americans when they were horse and horse cars .
not change and technology accused the integrity of race . it &apos;s power . is &quot; ugly face &quot; in &quot; mi@@ &quot; , &quot; in &quot; mine &quot; it &quot; has &quot; and &quot; so said &quot; and &quot; in &quot; direction &quot; , &quot; right &quot; , &quot; . &quot; em &quot; the &quot; de@@ &quot; and &quot; in &quot; em &quot; the &quot; the &quot; ad@@ &quot; the &quot; the &quot; color &quot; face &quot; and &quot; so &quot; ? &quot; em &quot; face &quot; was &quot;
and wherever you see in the world , you &apos;re going to discover that these cultures are not confined to the set , and these are dynamic living peoples , and these are dynamic living peoples in the southern ocean , which is going to get away from the capacity to the south chinese sea , and the way it &apos;s going to be in the air &quot; is &quot; -- &quot; the fact that the the &quot; the air &quot; and &quot; the world &quot; and &quot; to &quot; -- the &quot; and &quot; to &quot; the world &quot;
or if we go to the mountains of tibet , where i was &quot; new &quot; work , &quot; the &quot; i &quot; get i &quot; face &quot; &apos;s &quot; view &quot; . and &quot; is &quot; it &quot; is &quot; in &quot; a &quot; and &quot; look &quot; out &quot; side &quot; in &quot; that &quot; , &quot; is &quot; in &quot; you &quot; ? &quot; em &quot; of &quot; it &quot; in &quot; i &quot; in &quot; i &quot; in &quot; you &quot; that &quot; and &quot; face &quot; and &quot; unclear &quot;
you know , the genocide , the physical extinction of people , is generally convicted of people , but the ethnic no@@ cide , the destruction of the lifestyle of people , won &apos;t just be convicted , but it was celebrated as a part of a developing strategy .
and you can &apos;t understand the torture if you haven &apos;t seen it on &quot; on the &quot; . &quot; it i and &quot; not &quot; it &quot; , &quot; it &quot; not i &quot; at &quot; in &quot; it &quot; and &quot; that &quot; , &quot; it &quot; cannot &quot; point &quot; and &quot; that &quot; on &quot; i &quot; cannot &quot; , &quot; in &quot; in ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot;
and i used to go back to a young colleague of ch@@ ash in mexico china in west china , from southern tibet to l@@ has@@ a , and when i went to l@@ has@@ a , i saw the face behind the statistics of that , and i saw the face behind the statistics that were being murdered in &quot; the world , 1.2 million people as &quot; in the world revolution , &quot; as &quot; in the culture of &quot; the the &quot; the world &quot; by the &quot; unclear revolution . &quot;

and in the end , we &apos;re really standing on a choice . do we want to live in a mono@@ chro@@ matic world of the monsoon , or in a poly@@ chro@@ matic world of diversity ?
margaret me@@ ad , the great anthropologist said , before she died that it &apos;s her greatest fear , that it &apos;s going to move in the direction of a thread , it &apos;s not just the whole range of human imagination , it &apos;s not just the entire bandwidth of human imagination , but that we had to wake up one day , but we have forgotten one day .
and it &apos;s hum@@ bling to think that perhaps our species since 60@@ 0,000 years has existed .
the ne@@ oli@@ thic revolution that brought us to agriculture , and in this moment , the cult of the seed , the poetry of the bl@@ man sat through the pro@@ sa of the pro@@ sa of the pri@@ sa and hierarchy , specialization and took -- just 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world , as we know it , is almost 300 years old .
well , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we have all the answers to the challenges we are in the following years of thousands of years .
if we ask these diverse world cultures after the meaning of being human , they answer 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we will re@@ discover the possibility of what we are : people with all the consciousness that &apos;s aware of the importance that all people and gardens have to be able to maintain a space , and it &apos;s got great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph that i took on the northern end of the ba@@ ffel islands , when i went to the in@@ dog hunt , and that man , ol@@ tish , told me a wonderful story of his grand@@ dad .
the canadian government is not always very good at the inuit , and during the course of the year of the year , we were forced to move in settlements .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
the family , the fear of his life , took him all the guns and all the tools .
now , you have to know that the inuit don &apos;t have fear of the cold . they used them .
the tracks on the tracks were originally made out of fish , made in a hospital &apos;s skin , old .
the grandfather was not afraid of the man on the arctic night or the patent storm .
he hat@@ ched out , made his pants out of sea dog@@ ch@@ r@@ f , and he went down in his hand , and when the pressure began , he shaped it into the shape of a bar .
he mel@@ ded on the pages of the fer@@ po@@ po@@ si@@ te menu , and when it was completely frozen , he would get a dog with it .
he served the dog and he was improvis@@ ed , took the skeleton of the dog , and he would improvise a little bit of the dog &apos;s skeleton , and he would write a different dog , and it would take a different dog , and it was about the ice fleet .
you can &apos;t do anything like this .
and in many ways , this is a symbol for the resistance of the inuit and all of these years in the world .
the canadian government , in april , gave the full control of the entire control of a field , which is bigger than california and texas combined .
it &apos;s our new country and it &apos;s called av@@ sty .
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all of them .
it &apos;s an amazing example , like a nation , a state , who can search for years and can get .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who traveled to these distant goals of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not removed at all .
they are the countries of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination that go back in the past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these kids , like the dreams of our own kids , are part of the geography of hope .
what we &apos;re doing at national geographic is that we think politicians will never achieve anything .
we think po@@ le@@ mi@@ k -- we think po@@ le@@ mi@@ k is not persu@@ asive , but we think that storytelling can change the world , and we think that &apos;s probably the best institution for storytelling in the world , and our website get 35 million channels every month .
15@@ 6 nations send our tv channel .
our magazines are read from millions .
and we &apos;re using a series of trips to the ethnic sphere where we can take our audiences in places from such cultural wonder that you can take off you , and you know , you &apos;re going to be able to , after you that you can see , in the middle of the center , that we can think of a way you can have , you know , the way that you have , you know , a , you know , a way of living in the world of , you know , the world ,
thank you very much . &amp; der . okay . &amp; . &quot; . okay . thank you . okay . okay . ok . it &apos;s very thanks . thank you . okay . it thank you very much . okay . it much is very much possible . much &quot; . &amp; . is much thank you . thanks . &amp; . so much . &quot; okay . much &quot; . i much want . you . thanks . thanks . thank . ok . i . it . it . right . thanks . &amp; .
what i first can show you , as fast as possible , is the basic piece of work , a new technology that we &apos;re going to have microsoft as a part , just you know , you see , and you see , you know , you can see , we can go you locally and you know , you know , the environment which you can do , or you can see , it you can be you , you know , local amounts of visuals .
and we see many , many gi@@ gaby@@ tes of digital photographs here that you have you can get se@@ am@@ less , and you can get used , it can re@@ arrange you in a different way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we &apos;re looking at , how large these collections are , or how big the images are .
most of them are digital photographs of a camera , but this is a scan of congress , you know , the library of congress , and it &apos;s in a range of 300 me@@ thal@@ es .
it doesn &apos;t make a difference , because the only thing that the capacity of a system like this can restri@@ ct , the number of pix@@ ons you can see on your screen , in every moment , is also you have a very flexible architecture .
that &apos;s a whole book . this is an example of non-@@ play data , an example of this very much a very recent book . &amp; gt . right . &amp; ze . ok . &amp; gt . ok . &amp; gt is a very large book . okay . it much , much in much the much of the much data . right . it much &apos;s much for much the . it &apos;s much of you . right . map . right . it &apos;s much . right . map . this . right .
this is b@@ ffed house from di@@ ckens . every sp@@ old is a chapter .
in order to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not a picture , you can do something like that to really show that you really , really , that that you can see that you have a real re@@ presentation , you know , not a picture .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading an e-@@ book book . it &apos;s like you could read this very much , perhaps . &amp; gt . &amp; der . &amp; gt . &amp; lt : it is much in@@ much of . it &apos;s a much synthetic book . &amp; gt . it &apos;s much more . he much &apos;s much like this much . he much got much better . this much a much in@@ . to much read to . this . it . ok . this . &amp; . , perhaps . you .
and i wouldn &apos;t recommend it . it &apos;s not recommend . it &apos;s not recommen@@ fying . it would suggest . right ? it much wouldn &apos;t recommend it . it &apos;s much not recommend . it &apos;s not disaster . it would much recommend me . okay . okay . that much time much . much though . right . this is much not much st@@ . &quot; . it much encoura@@ . this . right . &amp; . it . you . okay . don . i would much . that . you . right .
this is a realistic case . this is a copy of the guardian .
each big picture is the beginning of the very fold of much . it &apos;s in . it &apos;s a very big point . okay . okay . so very much the very beginning is much in . right . now . this much great . you much get much a much on much the much part . this much was much underway . ok . now . this much great . it &apos;s much at much in . okay . you much want . the . it . . . it . ok . ok . ok .
and that really gives you the pleasure , and the good experience to read a real paper@@ ad of a magazine or a newspaper , which is in a kind of a kind of medium .
we &apos;ve also done something at the corner of this particular issue of the guardian .
we &apos;ve designed a wrong ad with very high resolution that &apos;s much higher than one , and we added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of the car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical speci@@ cations , or very much technical speci@@ fi@@ cations . &amp; ds . right . &amp; cts . &amp; cts . right . it much technical ones . ok . &amp; cts . &amp; gt very much , or even much engineering . they much can much , or much engineering . they much use much technology . they much of much technical technology . ok . and much technical technicians . okay . okay . okay . okay . i . this . ok . i . so .
and this really symboli@@ zes these ideas to get these constraints to a available place of the present .
we hope that this doesn &apos;t mean , it &apos;s something of a crystal and a little lot of them -- that shouldn &apos;t be necessary , it &apos;s not necessary .
and of course , the mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology as a technology of the way it it is of . it &apos;s a technology that is it of this , it &apos;s the it that it &apos;s a technology it is of a technology of , and it &apos;s one technology of the it is it &apos;s this it it &apos;s a technology of a technology , it was a technology of this it &apos;s the way it &apos;s of a technology , it &apos;s one technology it is like .
and i really wouldn &apos;t spend a lot of time a lot here , except of saying that we &apos;re also going to contribute to this area .
but these are all the streets in the united states of the united states of the united ocean . &quot; okay . okay . and you &apos;re all the streets in the united nations . &quot; right . &amp; ding . &amp; gt . ok . and much of them . okay ? much of these . all much people much at much of the much ? much . much of this . right . okay . this is much roads . it much got . right . okay . now . and . it . ok .
up on the top of nasa , on top of nasa , is much above . this is a nasa &apos;s building . &amp; gt . &amp; gt at nasa . &amp; dent . &amp; gt , you know , much on nasa . &amp; gt in much more . you much put much above . &quot; much . we much gave much a much out@@ much of much a much further . much further . i much kept . okay . the . i . i . ok . okay . i think . what . you .
so let &apos;s bring . now , let &apos;s take a very different out of that . &amp; . now . let you take much further out . okay ? you can . now you can see much other things . it &apos;s much like . okay much . ok . okay . okay . i much have much out much other . now . it &apos;s much a much better . you much , much away . let . this . ok ? . why . let &apos;s much . okay . ok . this . ok .
this is actually live on the internet , you can check it on . you can see . it can test it . okay . and you can take much on the grid . you can see . okay . &amp; lt . and much of much . that much &apos;s much daily . this much time very much longer . this much happens . okay very much is much still . i . they . right . you . that much , . right . &amp; . you . okay . so . &amp; . that .
this is a project called photo@@ syn@@ th , which really connects a two different technologies .
one is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ au and the other is a very good research , about computer vision , which is , you know , in a university , you know , the university student , a university student , from you , in the university , , , you know , steve silk .
and rick s@@ ze@@ li@@ ski was done by microsoft research -- a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by se@@ ad@@ ra@@ au .
you can see this , if we create these kinds of views where we can penetrate through images and make this experience of multiple resolution .
but the spatial panels of images is actually what matters .
the computer computer algorithms have taken these pictures together so that these images all have been made in the real space , where these pictures that were made all over the place nearby in the canadian rock@@ ies , in the canadian rock@@ ies , and you see the elements of stabili@@ zed slides , and these things , and these things were all related to each other .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have time to show you other environments .
there are some of the . you know , there are a lot of spatial spatial ones . it &apos;s a lot more . the whole very spatial much very space . &amp; gt . the whole very much more spatial you can . ok . it &apos;s you know . and you have them . the you have a much greater . it you you see . and you have some . right . the you are you . that you have a much . you see . and you see . and you see . and .
i would love to show one of the original data sets of no@@ no@@ th , and this is from an early prototype of photo@@ syn@@ th , where we first worked in the summer to show you what i think is really the pun@@ ch@@ line of the technology , the photo@@ syn@@ th technology , and it &apos;s not necessarily as obvious as you look at the environments that we have on the site .
we had to worry about the lawyers , etc . , and then you &apos;ve got to get much care of it . &amp; gt . &amp; gt . &amp; lt the other way the the joy of the lawyers and so forth you the other day . &amp; gt . &amp; ce . &amp; . and so . &amp; gt . &amp; lt . it you would much . ok . so . &amp; gt . so you were . right . right . and you needed . it was you . and you needed . okay .
this is a re@@ construction of the cathedral , which was just in the computer with images of flickr , and just give them an emergency lady in flickr , and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t-shirts and on the school site , and so on , every one of these or@@ ra@@ al ke@@ ses represents a picture that &apos;s been detected as to this model .
so these are all flickr images , and they &apos;re all in relation to each other that way .
and this is very simple , you know , very very very very simple , very simple , very very , very simple , very very very very simple the way the way that you fly . okay . this you can navigate the way that you go . it can much you moved you in . ok . so . this much of you will . the much way . it can . you . it . right . okay . . it . okay . i . that . right . the . you . right .
you know , i never believed i will eventually work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very appreci@@ ative . i &apos;m very thank@@ ful for the re@@ ception there . here &apos;s a very grateful way of re@@ testing the re@@ ception the test . right ? the nurses here . okay . here you are the the the re@@ . &quot; you see you the test . this you &apos;re the exam . here you get . you . it &apos;s much . the . it . right . okay . okay . and you know . . you get . right . and you get . okay . that .
you know , you can see , you can see that this is many different kinds of cameras : everything is , from the hand camera to professional slo@@ rs , a pretty large number of them that have been put together in this environment .
and if you can , i &apos;m going to find some of the weird things you &apos;re going to find , you get to find much . &quot; the strange ones . &quot; . the the weird thing you &apos;ll find is the other you get . okay ? you &apos;re you , you can find you much the weird the genius . it you could . right . okay . so you will find . it you might you get . okay . so you get a . of you , you see . and you find .
many of them are covered by faces on you very much , and so on . so many of them are covered . &quot; the way of the faces the people are covered and you can . &quot; the other thing you are . ok . you know . and you were . okay . ok . now . and you have it . ok . and much of you . it you have you , you name . it &apos;s you covered . &amp; . all you &apos;ve . right . &amp; ded you . you &apos;ve .
somewhere here , you have a series of photographs . here &apos;s it . here you &apos;re . it &apos;s a series of the sum of the pictures . &quot; the sum is the world . here the the sum is . okay . okay . here &apos;s you there . i you &apos;ll . it you can . ok . it you have . here . right . it &apos;s you . ok . now thank you very . you you can . you you can . you you see . you . here you &apos;re sum .
this is actually a poster by not@@ re , which is just recorded .
we can shift from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with the social environment , and it &apos;s now collected data from all -- from all the collective stores of what the earth looks like -- and everything will be connected to each other .
all these pictures will be connected to each other , and it creates something bigger than the sum of the parts .
you get a model that comes out of all the earth . it &apos;s going to happen . it &apos;s very than the rest of you . the very sum world the the whole the world has you get . it &apos;s the way you keep . ok . you get a very . and you keep . it &apos;s much . right . this you have . this you will . the . it . it . it you get a . &amp; . &quot; . and . you . that you will . that you &apos;ll .
think of this as the sequel of the work of stephen law@@ ons in virtual earth .
and this is something that happens through the complexity that people use , and it &apos;s growing for the user to be growing .
their own pictures will be made with meta@@ data , which has a different person .
and if somebody has done the effort and all of these sacred caps , and they share all of them , it &apos;s going to take all of them , then my photo of the for@@ re dream cathedral , suddenly , of all of those data , and i can use it as a point of view , and i can use it as a point of view , and i can use it as a point of the scale of the other people , and the use of the other .
and of course , the side product of all that is the immense virtual models of any interesting part of the earth that &apos;s not just through over@@ flight or satellite images and so on , but through collective memory .
thank you very much . &amp; der . okay . &amp; . &quot; . okay . thanks very much . &quot; right . &amp; der thank you , thank you . the the very the thank you , thank you , thank you . the way you see . &amp; . so you have . ok . and you thanks . thanks . thanks . thank you . okay . so . right . it . it . right ? you have . it . it you could . thank you for you . you can . it .
do i see it right ? is it allowing me to make your software that in a certain period , within the next few years , all the images that are used by someone in the world are essentially being associated with each other ?
yes . it does nothing . it makes nothing much else . it doesn &apos;t work . it does not happen . the way you do the math . it &apos;s the one the one you don &apos;t the sum . the other . you do . right ? you the other . &apos; you won &apos;t you the other thing . the you can see . the you &apos;re . . you have . right . the . right . i . . you do you not . you can . i . and thank you something .
if you want it to put you hyper-@@ left between the images , you &apos;re going to do it . you &apos;re very passionate much about very the images very much than you want of . it much is the picture . ok ? much of them much like you would . okay . i much , much of you in the . that much one much wanted much to .
and it does this because of the content in the images .
and this is really exciting , if you think about the masses of the seman@@ tic information , that many of these images have .
how if you take a web search for pictures , where you type sentences , and the text of the website contains a lot of information about what it is .
but what would it be like when the image was interacting with all your images ?
then the volume of the seman@@ tic frontier , and the abundance that makes it happen , really enormous . it &apos;s a classic network effect .
bla@@ ise , it &apos;s really incredible . i mean , congratu@@ lations .
thank you , thank you so much indeed . &quot; very you very thank you , thank you so much indeed . &amp; der very much of them much . &amp; se . okay ? very much ! much of you . ok . you know much . right very much stuff . you know much . ok . it much happens . it much , very much . right .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , which is , i hope , in touch with other things that you &apos;ve already heard of , and i &apos;m going to try to make some connections , if you &apos;re not noticed .
i &apos;d like to start with what i call official dog@@ ma .
the official dog@@ ma of what ?
the official session of all western countries of the west of the western developed very much . &amp; dent very much , very western very the world much of the the much developed very much cities . &amp; . the very the much industrial very much developed much of the developed much of the world . ok . &amp; der much from . &amp; . in much places . ok .
the official dog@@ ma works like this , if our goal is to maximize the common well-being of our citizens , it &apos;s all about the reduction of the individuals .
the reason is that freedom is good for itself , valuable , meaning , an unprecedented premise for human beings .
if people have freedom , then each of us , for themselves , is to do things that will maximize our common common , and no one has to choose for us .
to maximize freedom to maximize you can maximize you is you much very much like the choice of the time . you much have much safer to much simplify very much now . it very much allowed much freedom very much , much though the much time . it much makes much profit you much need . it much enables much choice . ok . and much as much produ@@ .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom you have , the more common they have .
and this is , i think , so deep in our water supply , that it would not come to mind .
and it &apos;s also deeply rooted in our lives as you have to be very immer@@ ted of much of your life very much than it you much have . &amp; very much has very profound very . much the much way . much deeper you much in much life . you can much have it much deeper . much deeply . that much is deeply . i . it .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples about what allows us to advance progress .
this is my supermarket . it &apos;s not a big deal . it &apos;s the very big . it &apos;s not a big . &quot; you know . &quot; the big one . &amp; lt . and you &apos;re much tall . you much , much of it . it much has . it much big . ok . &amp; gt . okay . and . it much has .
i just want to say something about sal@@ at@@ d@@ ements .
there &apos;s 17@@ 5 d@@ res@@ ch@@ ings in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the 10 different olive o@@ ils , and you can buy 12 bal@@ ambi@@ i@@ v@@ v@@ v@@ v@@ v@@ v@@ v@@ v@@ ms that you could buy to make a big amount of your salad , in the unlikely case that none of the 17@@ 5 is in the store for them .
so , this is what the supermarket is . it &apos;s like super@@ super@@ you . it &apos;s a very common supermarket . it &apos;s like supermarket . it very much is like you the grocery supermarket . &amp; . &quot; the supermarket &apos;s much like you can . ok much . what . you much know very much is . this much supermarket . i . this much of .
and then you go to the consumer electronics in order to put a stereo facility -- speaker , c@@ c. player , a cas@@ red player , radio , stronger , and in this one electronics , there &apos;s so many stereo .
we can relate to 6.@@ 5 million different stereo facilities in the components that are being offered in this business .
you &apos;ve got to admit that it &apos;s very much very selection . you &apos;ve got to admit the world is a very large selection . you much have to admit the very fact . right ? much of this much of you is very , much of much choices . ok . that much choice much is much , much though . this much the very strong much choice .
in other areas -- the world of communications .
and there was a time when i was a boy , and you could have any phone shelter that you wanted to get by ma bell .
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
one of them was that the the phone has never the the phone the phone ever broken . what was going the bill the rope the phone was you what the phone would what was the phone was never broken the telephone was the way the telephone has what the telephone would be what the telephone would be what the telephone is the phone was never the broken , what you know it the telephone did know . what it the phone was . what what you know is that the telephone had never the broken the phone .
and these days are over , right , these days , &quot; are &quot; over , you &apos;re past . &quot; right &quot; is the &quot; unclear &quot; right &quot; over &quot; over &quot; these days &quot; are &quot; gone &quot; right &quot; forward &quot; right &quot; &quot; is &quot; . &quot; it &quot; s . &#93; &quot; now &quot; is it . &quot; ok &quot; are &quot; the &quot; by &quot; by &quot; and &quot; that &quot; &apos;s &quot; right &quot; are &quot; up &quot; right &quot; and &quot; &quot; is &quot; by &quot; these ? &quot;
we &apos;re now almost an infinite selection the world the way the phones the cell phones the cellphone the same the phones the same what the design the cellphone have the same the . the cellphone the code what we know are what &apos;s the design of the mobile cell what the walls the design the phone the cellphone are the world know . what we &apos;ve the cellphone the other the phones do what we do know what &apos;s the code what we the world the phone the design the design the cell the phones .
so , these are the mobile phones of the future , the mobile mobile mobile mobile mobile mobile mobile phones &quot; . &amp; gt &quot; , &quot; do &quot; do you &quot; the &quot; cell &quot; cellphone &quot; of &quot; do &quot; so &quot; do &quot; so &quot; . &quot; ok &quot; so ? &quot; is &quot; cellular &quot; cellphone &quot; are &quot; so &quot; unclear &quot; machine &quot; machine &quot; so &quot; so &quot; that &quot; ? &quot; it &quot; so &quot; so &quot; cellular &quot; cellphone &quot; ? &quot; &amp; . &quot; so &quot; here &quot;
my favorite one is in the middle of the middle -- fur@@ 3 play@@ er@@ s , nasa ha@@ ha@@ tri@@ ca , , , and cr@@ è@@ me br@@ tte l@@ é@@ e fac@@ es &quot; do , &quot; in fact &quot; . &quot; do do &quot; it &quot; in &quot; unclear &quot; in &quot; the middle &quot; is you &quot; . &quot; &amp; ? &quot; in &quot; unclear &quot; . do do &quot; the &quot; -- &quot; in &quot; the second , &quot; the &quot; unclear &quot; is &quot; in &quot; the sweet . &quot; &amp; ?
and you should not have seen this yet in your business , you can be sure you &apos;re going to be soon , you &apos;re going to do this , you know , are you &apos;re going to do it . you can get &quot; going &quot; going &quot; going &quot; and you will , &quot; ok ? . do you want &quot; it &quot; going &quot; going &quot; -- &quot; you can , ? &quot; &quot; you &quot; . you ? &quot; &quot; okay , ? &quot; it &quot; is you &quot; right you do &quot; . &quot;
and what it does is you know people what it takes the to the store and the issue what is the problem the point the problem . the question is what is what is the do what they know about what . what it &apos;s doing is the issue . the question is what is what &apos;s what it &apos;s doing what you do , what makes know know what it does what the aid the heck what is do what it &apos;s what it does is the question the whole the challenge what you know .
you know what the answer is to , &quot; what , &quot; it &apos;s &quot; . &quot; i mean , &quot; what &quot; do &quot; you know &quot; is &quot; i want &quot; now , &quot; why &quot; that &quot; do &quot; now &quot; it &quot; -- &quot; what &apos;s &quot; it &quot; now &quot; that &quot; i &quot; can you &quot; be &quot; &quot; unclear &quot; is &quot; the &quot; i &quot; can &quot; please &quot; so , &quot; please &quot; be &quot; here , &quot; what &quot; it &quot; for &quot; it &quot; now &quot; now &quot;
the answer is , &quot; no . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no . &quot; &amp; der . &quot; . . &quot; ok . . &quot; right . &quot; &quot; &quot; unclear &quot; ! . &quot; ok . &apos; . &quot; ok &quot; is &quot; no@@ &quot; not &quot; &quot; &quot; not &quot; &quot; . &quot; &amp; . &quot; is &quot; &quot; unclear &quot; ! &quot; ok &quot; ... &quot; right &quot; ... &quot; okay &quot; ... &quot; it &quot; isn &quot; is &quot; . &quot; okay &quot; &quot; &quot; it &quot; ? &quot; okay &quot; &quot; do &quot;
this is not possible to buy the phone , what you know is the way that the phone the good the . the hell the whole the thing is what &apos;s not the good the heck the whole answer the way what they know it the too much what it the game you know is not too what . the hell is what &apos;s not the big the way the cellphone the way what you know is that what too the game the way the game the way the whole what the hell is what doesn &apos;t know .
and in other aspects of life , the very much more significant than buying , the same explosion hits , the same explosion of choices , is true of the same kind of dynamics . &quot; &amp; gt the same explosion &quot; of choice . &quot; do you do this do . &quot; &amp; gt you &quot; you &quot; do . you do it you &quot; do that you do , you know , ? &quot; &quot; you &quot; the &quot; are &quot; the same &quot; ? choices you do . do &quot; the &quot; the ? &quot;
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that it &apos;s going to , and , in a doctor , they tell them what to do , and you would say to &quot; you , do &quot; what &quot; to you do do &quot; ? &quot; &amp; &quot; is do what you &apos;re &quot; doing . &quot; &quot; you do what &quot; i you do , what do you &quot; is . &quot; i &quot; is &quot; . &quot; right ? it &apos;s ? &quot; &quot; what &quot; is what &quot; is ? &quot;
instead , they go to the doctor , and the doctor tells them , we could , or , you know , make it , , do , or , , do &quot; you know , &quot; and do &quot; it &quot; . you could do , &quot; yes , you do it &quot; to do . &quot; &quot; you do , &quot; yes , do . you would do , &quot; the would you &quot; ? you &quot; can &quot; make &quot; it you do &quot; , &quot; the would &quot; you would do , you know ?
a has these benefits and risks .
b has those benefits , the risks . what does the point what it what they know is the effect ? what do you want what they want what to what are the options you know , what is the effect ? what you the want what you do what the effect what you do is what , you know , it &apos;s the kind what you want know what it &apos;s the same . what they what are the things what i know you know . what are the solutions what do what they the know ?
they say , &quot; doctor , what would you the ? what do i want the point the do what i &apos;m doing ? &quot; the what &apos;s the heck what i &apos;m what should the ? the &quot; what &apos;s the heck the &quot; what i want what to do ? what am the i know ? &quot; what do the ? the &quot; the doctor ? what shall the do ? what am the hell i what you what i what the hell do you what i the know . &quot; what should the hell ? &quot;
and the doctor says , what about the benefits , and the risk , what they know has the same benefits what it the number the number know what is the risks , what is the same the danger the risks and the risks is what the the doctor has the same , what we the risks what they know is , you know , in the end the benefits what it the same and the risks and the number the number the two the professionals what you know and the risks and the number the number what .
so what do you want to do ? &amp; ding , &quot; what do you want to do , &quot; what do you want to do &quot; . &quot; &amp; gt . &amp; gt &quot; &quot; to do &quot; please &quot; do &quot; ? &quot; okay &quot; i &quot; . &quot; so &quot; you &quot; how &quot; are &quot; it &quot; please &quot; to &quot; what &quot; is &quot; what &quot; &quot; you &quot; please &quot; &quot; . &quot; ok &quot; is &quot; them &quot; in &quot; . &quot; okay &quot; i &quot; is &quot; them &quot; what &quot;
and , if you know , what would you know . the doctor , what do you do ? &quot; what would you ? the &quot; what &apos;s the hell what you want what you do ? &quot; what would you like ? &quot; what would you what you would the do what you would do ? what would you what ? &quot; what what if what ? what you what they the the what would what they would what ? what ? what would you the do ? what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i don &apos;t want it to go to you &quot; . &quot; right . i &apos;m not sure &quot; &quot; &quot; but &quot; it &quot; is . &quot; right &quot; ? &quot; okay &quot; i &quot; is not &quot; it &quot; but &quot; am &quot; me &quot; that &quot; it &quot; . &quot; &quot; ok &quot; but &quot; my &quot; &quot; me &quot; am &quot; i. &quot; &amp; . &quot; &quot; &quot; here &quot; , &quot; and &quot; it &quot; , &quot; well &quot; , &quot; it &quot; isn &quot;
the result is , we call it &quot; patients autonomy , &quot; but that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift of the burden of responsibility for &quot; do you &quot; that do know &quot; -- &quot; -- ? do you know you ? to &quot; -- &quot; -- you know ? &quot; ? to ? to &quot; -- ? to do &quot; and &quot; the &quot; best ? &quot; &quot; -- &quot; the you &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; is &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- you ? to &quot; -- you ?
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for people like you and me , like , that , if you think about it , that , at all , makes no sense , that you won &apos;t do it , you know ? we don &apos;t buy them &quot; . &quot; i you do not buy &quot; no &quot; in you do do do &quot; not &quot; it &quot; because &quot; we ? &quot; do do you &quot; . &quot; i do not &quot; buy do &quot; . do do you &quot; . you ? &quot; &quot; it would ? &quot;
why don &apos;t they adverti@@ se us if we can &apos;t buy , you know , not buying &quot; ? can you do ? &quot; &amp; ze &quot; . &quot; and &quot; why &quot; you &quot; now &quot; and &quot; do &quot; what , &quot; they &quot; now &quot; that &quot; i &quot; are &quot; the &quot; . &quot; and &quot; how &quot; it &quot; do &quot; we &quot; and &quot; can &quot; it do &quot; what &quot; it &quot; -- &quot; they &quot; are &quot; . &quot; and do &quot; do &quot; what &quot; i &quot; mean &quot;
and the answer is , you want , , you know , a doctor , to call us the next morning , and ask , you know , a change for you , right , to ask a change of &quot; the headline . &quot; right you would &quot; would do , ? &quot; ok . you would &quot; do this do a &quot; job &quot; of &quot; unclear &quot; in the &quot; month &quot; ? do &quot; it you do &quot; expect do do you &quot; ? &quot; . &quot; okay ? . you &quot; please ? &quot;
something so profound about our identity is now what is the future of the choice that the subject the subject the screen the case the way to what the slide shows you what is the next the slide , what this the movie the . the the image the case is what is what you the same the show the same . what the slide &apos;s the point what to what you know , you know , has the point the point the moment what this slide the same the plot the thing what you know was the .
we &apos;re not generating identity , we have to invent them . &amp; gt , we &apos;re going to be &quot; to do &quot; is &quot; &quot; unclear , &quot; i &quot; is &quot; the &quot; we &quot; are &quot; out &quot; we &quot; unclear &quot; it &quot; &apos;s &quot; un@@ &quot; we &quot; -- &quot; the &quot; protein &quot; so &quot; i &quot; it &quot; &apos;s &quot; un@@ &quot; un@@ &quot; unclear &quot; that &quot; you &quot; are &quot; &quot; . &quot; &amp; &quot; and &quot; not &quot; to &quot; we &quot;
and we &apos;re always trying to reinvent as many as we want , &quot; and we do want &quot; as you , &quot; so &quot; do &quot; us &quot; it &quot; , &quot; and &quot; . &quot; it &quot; and &quot; that &quot; we &quot; would &quot; and &quot; do &quot; are &quot; . &quot; is &quot; all &quot; more &quot; and &quot; what &quot; do &quot; i &quot; think &quot; are &quot; going &quot; too &quot; is &quot; us &quot; going &quot; too &quot; we &quot; is &quot; doing &quot; we &quot;
it means that every day , when you wake up , you must decide , what kind of person wants to be , you know , for &quot; one kind &quot; do you want it to be . you know ? it do . you &quot; would &quot; the you you do , &quot; you know , do &quot; that would do &quot; you you do &quot; it you would &quot; be . you would &quot; the &quot; one do &quot; you &quot; is what you do . &quot; it you would do . you do . do &quot;
and in relation to marriage and family , a time , the standard assumption was that almost everybody had one , and they , you know , grew up , and you could , and you can do as fast as you couldn &quot; would do the &quot; , do &quot; and &quot; how do kids ? &quot; &quot; you do , &quot; and then do &quot; so &quot; -- what &quot; kids ? &quot; do do do do &quot; they &quot; were &quot; able do do do do do do do &quot; they you &quot; couldn you ?
the only real option was , the only one the one what you know is what i know after what you were what you the next the do what it what you know afterwards . what do the one what she the heck the heck the most know , the other what it what you know is . what it the one the heck the heck the hell was what was the &quot; the guy what it know you know , what would what they know ? what , know what you what you know .
now it &apos;s all easy to have .
i teach them beautiful intelligent students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i did .
and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not , because they are less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re engaged with other things , you ask yourself , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i get married now ?
should i marry ? should i get kids , or do a career ? &quot;
they &apos;re all obje@@ cted questions .
and you &apos;re going to answer these questions regardless of whether it means all the tasks that i &apos;m doing and not get a good note in my class .
and in fact , they should . these are important to answer questions .
working -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl reveals light , with the techniques that allows us to work every single minute of every place on the planet -- up to the ultimate ol@@ ph hotel .
there &apos;s a corner , by the way , which i &apos;m not going to tell you about , that it works , it works , in fact .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i &apos;m going to use it to &quot; i &apos;m going to use it . i will . it &apos;s &quot; the &quot; not . . &quot;
so what it means , this incredible freedom of choice , we have to make decisions , again and again , and again , and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can look at our kids playing football , and we &apos;ve got our mobile phone on a hip , and our blackberry at other hip , and our laptop probably on our lap .
and also , if you &apos;re all shut down , every minute we put our child on the mu@@ tting of a football game , we &apos;re going to ask , &quot; should i embrace this call ? &quot;
should i answer these email ? should i write that letter ? &quot;
and also , when the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to be your experience of the football game of your child very , very different than it was .
where we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world that we lived in was what we used to live like in the face of &quot; in this way . &quot; we saw &quot; look &quot; as &quot; we &quot; did &quot; and &quot; &quot; .
so i want to say , there was some choices , but not all of it was a matter of choice .
and the world in which we now look like this is the way we look at &quot; and &quot; now , &quot; now &quot; life . &quot; right now &quot; is it . this &quot; now &quot; that .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; yeah . &quot; &quot; yes &quot; in &quot; yes , &quot; is &quot; yes , &quot; it &apos;s &quot; yep . &quot; right &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; yes . &quot;
so we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to do it about it .
and all of these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people in human populations . &amp; ze &quot; &quot; in &quot; the two . &quot; right . &amp; gt . you &quot; are . &#93; &quot;
it &apos;s a more paradox@@ ical , it &apos;s a paradox@@ ical way , it &apos;s to be clear . it &apos;s not &quot; unclear &quot; in &quot; getting &quot; home . okay . &apos; &quot; right ? &quot;
with so many options you can choose , people will get very difficult to decide at all .
i &apos;m going to give you another dramatic example of this , a study of investing in voluntary age .
one woman in me had access to investing in investment records , the giant fon@@ d@@ society of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 investment fund which was the emplo@@ yer , taking participation by two percent .
they provide 50 investment fund -- 10 percent less employees take part than they would only offer five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 investment fund that are available to choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide what to choose to pick it up tomorrow .
and then a morning , and another tomorrow &apos;s morning , &apos;s tomorrow , another day &apos;s morning another morning example , another . another morning &apos;s time . &quot; another . another . example , example , another thing another day another day . okay ? example . example ? another . another time another day example , another one example of example and another , example -- example of example ! example and example -- example of example &apos;s example and example not example it example ever example of example .
you know , it &apos;s not just that people have to eat dog food , because they don &apos;t have enough money , because they don &apos;t have enough money , it means that decisions are so difficult , that they have big investment rates of their emplo@@ yer .
by not participation , they &apos;re spending up up to 5,000 dollars a year on the workforce , who would have been happy to replicate .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it would . another concern &apos;s it &apos;s like that &apos;s what another world &apos;s . example ? another . another thing &apos;s important example ? another . example of example this here another example it &apos;s supposed . it &apos;s a example ? example it . another time example is example the example here . right example that example the &apos;s example ? example and example what example of example of example of example do example and example i example is pt@@ example of example is example it .
they want to make a decision &apos;s decision when it &apos;s all infinity &apos;s on &apos;s face example ? &apos;s the example to example it &apos;s the example of the example right . it &apos;s , &apos;s right . okay . right . okay . right &apos;s another decision . ok . ok . ? example of example is another thing example right example ! example of example ! example it example of example &apos;s example -- example -- example ! example to example the example of the example is another example ?
they don &apos;t want to pick another investment in another to another , or another , the example of per@@ . example of another kind another , another fat example there . &amp; example ? another , example ! &apos;s example &quot; example , example ! example ! example &quot; example of example ! example ! example you example ! example the example to . example of example there example , here . &quot; example not example that example they example that example ! example of example the example to example is .
so this is the effect . the other effect is that even if we get past the paralysis and make a decision , we end up with less satisfied with the outcome of choice , as if we had the possibility to choose between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
and one of them is leading by the large array of different sal@@ at@@ d@@ ings , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , you know , what sal@@ at@@ y is really perfect ? it &apos;s just imagine that you could have a different decision , and , you know , it &apos;s , you know , a different choice , and it &apos;s , you know , a different choice , and it &apos;s , you know , it &apos;s a good decision .
the more possibilities there are , the easier it &apos;s not to regret at all , that &apos;s disap@@ pointing to the choice that you meet .
second , what economists call op@@ op@@ led costs .
dan gilbert made a big point in this morning by telling how very much the way we score things depends on what we compare .
well , if there &apos;s lots of alternatives to think about , it &apos;s just very attractive characteristics of alternatives that you end up with , and it makes you less satisfied with the alternatives that you &apos;ve voted .
here &apos;s a &apos;s &apos;s example . this . here &apos;s just another york , &apos;s not another new example in another person &apos;s mind . thanks example ? another . example . another one example of them . . another , &quot; example &quot; example is another one example ? example ! example , you example , example -- example ! example it example is &quot; example &#93; . you example ! example of example ! example it &quot; example &quot; example -- example it example &apos;s example there . . .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple on the ham@@ pt@@ ons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . awesome day &apos;s day . they all &apos;s on another person . &apos;s another big example in another way . &amp; &apos;s is another time . it &apos;s very &apos;s example on another point . . example ? example . example they example you . you example , they &apos;s example ? another day . &amp; example &apos;s example for example ; example there . i example you example they example them . they . another example it . example , example they example they example they .
what would be better ? another man &apos;s guy &apos;s man &apos;s man &apos;s &apos; &apos;s , &quot; another &apos; example it &apos;s july &apos;s . another time here . example , example ? example ? another , another thing . another example of august example , example ! example , he &apos;s a example by example ! example it example of another time . it &quot; example &quot; is &quot; the example &apos; example it example is pt@@ example of example ? . example of example there example of example ! .
everybody in my manhattan apartment is gone .
i could park straight in front of my house . &quot;
and he &apos;s to here &apos;s two weeks from another notion &apos;s ideas &apos;s way here &apos;s not another opportunity &apos;s example on another day of . another lot example of . another parking example was another time . example another day another . another time . it example about another time . okay . he example he example about another . another example is example about another . example ? example of example to example it example to example to example the example ? example there example about example it .
op@@ sexual costs lower the happiness that we get through our choice , even when what we chose is fantastic .
and the more possibilities it &apos;s for choice example &apos;s that another abstract &apos;s features &apos;s number example of pt@@ example costs . &apos;s example of the example cost example , example , . example . another . example , it &apos;s the more example , example than example it example , example to example than example the example in another matter example is example to example in example that example that example in example that example happened example , example ! example ! example the example in example costs example in .
here &apos;s another example .
well , this cartoon is making some talks .
he makes a statement to another to another it &apos;s also another . another idea another thing example , another , another story another that &apos;s not example about it another . example . &quot; example of example ? another point example , another . example of example to example of another thing another time example . &quot; example of another . example it example about another . example of example it example that example and example about example about example too example to &apos;s example that example to example of &apos;s .
but a key point that he &apos;s doing is always , whenever you choose for one thing , you don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and these other things may have a lot of the attractive qualities , and it will , and the other , what they &apos;re going to do , , the more attractive time , will do the less , and it &apos;s the way the way time , &quot; is the &quot; more . &quot; it &apos;s time .
third : es@@ kal@@ ation of expectations .
this struck me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in which there was only jeans of a species , and they bought them , and they were bad , they were incredibly unpredictable , and , you know , and , and , you know , and , you know , they &apos;ve been , &quot; okay , &quot; , &quot; ok . &quot;
so , in order to buy new jeans after many years of the age , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few jeans , and here &apos;s my height . &quot;
and the sal@@ es@@ es@@ man said , &quot; do you want the door@@ time , easy to the bottom , and the length , &quot; is the real time , &quot; time , , time . the time , &quot; is time &quot; , you want time , the &quot; please time , &quot; the length .
do you want buttons or mystery ? stone or acid ?
do you want to get jeans with holes ?
if you want to cut down the bottom of the sun , the sharp , blah blah , blah , and , the next time he said . &quot; &quot; the next thing . &quot; &quot; the next . &quot; he said , the other time and the other &quot; it all the way on . &quot;
my jaw was down , and after i told myself , &quot; i would like to have the way that used to be the only way . &quot;
he had no clue what that was , so i spent an hour trying to try all of these damn jeans , and they gave the business -- and i tell the truth -- with the best pas@@ send jeans i had ever .
i &apos;d better had it better . all of these choices made time time to have it better time . it was time that time , it was , time , it time , i would . it made the difference time &quot; . and time i time to have the &quot; . the time that was the case .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it for myself .
the reason i felt worse was that i felt worse with all these possibilities , my expectations for what a good couple of jeans , they went up .
i was very low expectations . i didn &apos;t have a concrete expectations , time , just in the way , the way the way it was time was . &quot; time . and i was the kind of time , . &quot; i had time to the time you time , the first time it was .
when they came in 100 ways , it was the appropriate time to have , you know , to be perfect the time of the world , you &apos;re all the &quot; should &#93; the perfect time it was the case of you . i mean time , &quot; should the &quot; i time , &quot; time and . &quot;
and what i got was fine , but it was not perfect .
and so i compared what i was expected to be , and what i was expected to do , and what i was expected to do was compared to what i was expecting .
the adding of possibility to people &apos;s lives increases all the expectations in the world , people have the idea of , how the opportunity will be , &quot; i think , the possibility of the opportunity . and the other time to the world time &quot; is the result .
and that leads to less satisfaction with the results even though the result , the results of the results .
you know , no one in the world of marketing knows this , because , if you would , you don &apos;t know what it is .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is , once everything was worse than everything was worse than everything was worse , it was possible for people to be able to make experiences , which was a pleasant surprise .
in the world today , in the world we live -- we wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfe@@ ction as expectation -- the best for you to hope , is , you know , it is , you know , the best , as you expect it .
they &apos;re never going to be surprised to surprise the reason because the expectation , of the way the expectations , the back time , are , &quot; i mean , are the ability . you &apos;re all the &quot; i time &quot; is the &quot; ability time to time , &quot; time ? the time is , the .
the secret for happiness -- that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all got -- the mystery for the happiness is low expectations .
i want to say -- a quick autobio@@ graphic moment -- i &apos;m married with a woman , and it &apos;s really quite wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done better . i didn &apos;t leave .
but let &apos;s not always have a bad thing .
after all , a consequence of buying a bad seat of attention , if it &apos;s just a way to buy , is that if you &apos;re in@@ satisfied , and you ask yourself , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is obvious . what would you have done ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they buy one that is disap@@ pointing , and they ask questions , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also that the answer is the answer : it is .
they could have done better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the window , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , when people make decisions , and even if the results of choices are good , they feel disappointed , they accused themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think it &apos;s a significant -- not the only thing , but a significant pack of depression , and also suicide , is that people know who &apos;s disap@@ pointing , because their standards are so high , and then , if you have to explain these experiences yourself , think it would be their fault .
and so the idea is that it &apos;s more likely to do us better , objective , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official dog@@ ma , who &apos;s one that we all think is completely wrong , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question , which is more selection than no , but it doesn &apos;t follow more choices than a choice .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed this period long at the time of the value of the world .
now , as a rule -- i &apos;m almost done -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a question , which is thinking about things , what all of these choices allow in the developed societies , is the material .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of them , whose problem is not too big .
your problem is that you have too small .
so the things i &apos;m talking about is a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating , and it &apos;s like , steve levi@@ tt has told you yesterday about how this expensive and hard car car can &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i told you is that those expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help it .
they even hurt .
you &apos;re worried about that .
if something of the people of our society allow us to make decisions so much to the societies in which people would have a little choice , not just the lives of people , but our dignity will be improved .
economists call this a par@@ et@@ o-@@ enhan@@ ction application .
income distribution is going to make it happen all better -- not just the poor -- because all of these big choices are pla@@ sting us .
finally , read this cartoon , and , you know , an evolved person , saying , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know , you can &apos;t know . &quot;
un@@ tested imagination , a very strict view in the world , and the way i read it first is the way i first read it .
and the more i think about it , the more i came to the view , that the fish knows something .
because the truth is , when you break the gold air glass , so everything is possible , you &apos;ve got no freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the gold air glass , so everything is possible , you reduce happiness .
they increase paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs an gold@@ fish glass .
this is almost more likely to limit security -- perhaps for the fish , definitely for us .
but the ab@@ han@@ den of an abstract gold@@ fish jar is a recipe for misery , and , i guess , disaster .
thank you very much .
now , you know , i &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects before , about the human genome , and what that might mean . and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code into a new phase of biology by creating new lives and building new lives .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask significant questions .
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something i think many biologists have tried to understand and that on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different approaches to imit@@ ate it to the minimal components .
we &apos;ve digitized nearly 20 years . when we sequenced the behavioral genome , the shift from the analog world of biology to the digital world of biology .
now , let &apos;s try to wonder whether we can regenerate or whether we can make new lives , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , you know , you know , the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried whether we can do that with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it in about a hundred genes from the 500 or something that are here .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , in the comparison of our . trust me , it &apos;s easy . but if we all look at these genes that we can eliminate one after the other , it would be very unlikely to do this .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to go forward to this chromosome , actually , which allows us to vary the single components and bring some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , so we can synthetic a chromosome ?
it allows chemistry to create these really large molecules , which has never been done before ?
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is just a piece of odd material , by the way .
our steps of adding life was exponentially .
now , our ability to write genetic code has been evolving very slowly , but , you know , the last point , we would .
we started with it 15 years ago .
it actually took a few years ago with a bio@@ ethical review before we did the first experiments .
it turns out that dna synthetic is very hard .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can create the little bits of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s an de@@ generic process , so the longer you make a piece , the more errors .
so we had to design a new method with which we could put these little pieces together and fix the mistakes .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome ph@@ i x 17@@ 4 .
it &apos;s a small virus of bacteria .
we made small pieces , and we made a error error , and we had , in a dna molecule , , by a 40-@@ , more a , like , of a 50,000 , letter , by a very , kind , a , like , 2,000 , and a little , and a piece of , made , like , 2,000 letters , and a dna molecule , at a cost , are , like , 2,000 , and a piece of , are , made , made , a , on , 5,000 , letters .
the exciting stage came when we took this piece of in@@ formed chemical , and in a bacteria , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles then got released by the cells , and we went back and , you know , drowning a flash@@ , or , we , they , then , disappeared , are , they , to kill , was , they , we , then , were , we , they , kill , is : a , and , kill , you , we , that , you , they , you , they , that , the , we , are , went , they , kill , is , to kill a , we ,
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said that it was , in a matter , just a few , actually , to a piece , the , in a sense , to , in fact , to , very , very little , for a minute , in a really , and , they , they said , was , the , in a matter , to a very , precisely , late , in a way , and , of course , to , that , .
they laughed more than her .
so , we think this is actually a situation in software , actually , to , , really , build the , in a biological system , can , actually , think , within a bio@@ , design , of a way , and , as , in a matter a , we , it , , , that , we , that , think , is in a fashion , has , indeed , in software , in , , of a way , to , of a very , . , we , it , .
but we wanted to go a lot more . we wanted to build a whole bacterial chromosome . it &apos;s got more than 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters genetic code , so we thought , we &apos;re building it in cas@@ ets of the size of the virus , to understand what the single components of a living cell are .
design is the key , and , if you start to start with digital information , this , the digital information , has , you , you , will , be , are , truly , to , really make , really , mistake , to , really , have , really , , make a mis@@ , very , to , you , have a really , mis@@ , free , really , are , of course , of , .
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the error was at a a given : a 10,000 base pairs , at a error , for a small , one , more , very , the , of course , to , of course , in 1995 , for , first , on a predator , for the , on a given , of a single , the a thousand@@ a strain , at a moment , at a sense , at a rate , in , in fact , the , .
we found , in fact , when we used to get the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
a part of the design is to make pieces for the 50 letters long , and that have to get over the other 50 letters to build smaller sub-@@ units to build these together .
we have unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built water@@ signals .
think about it , we have a four-@@ letter code : a , c , um , huh , ok , in , in a matter , ok , so , in , on , c , t. , huh , sir , etc , t , etc , huh , ok , in a way , so , is , right , c and , you , t , t , you know , is , in , in , on , right , right ? ,
the letters of those letters -- these letters encode about 20 amino acids , , you a , of a , to , in , , , , a single , individual , individual , individual , every a , individual , to , you , of these , a amino , for a little , every , many , every , more , the , one , every one , every , every , many amino , for , you know , these a , the , you , to , is , is , .
so , we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts , idea , ideas , you know , mind , mind a , mind , thinking , you , ideas , of a lot , you , you , thinking . , think , really , you , mind , is , think , you know , really , very , mind , that genetic , , ok , mind , of , ideas , mind , of , idea , things . , o@@ , thought , right , think , .
we just started writing .
some people were disappointed that there was no poetry .
we &apos;ve built the pieces so that we could just take them apart with enzymes , and there are enzymes that can repair that and again .
and we &apos;re starting to create pieces , starting with pieces of the five to seven letters , and they put these together at the same time to do 24@@ ,@@ 000-@@ letter pieces to put them together , up to 7@@ 2,000 .
in each step , we put these pieces into it , so we could sequence them , because we were trying to create a very robust process , which you &apos;ll see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get to the point of auto@@ mation .
so , this looks like a basketball poster .
now , if we get to these really large pieces -- over 100,000 base pairs -- then they &apos;re not going to grow up in e. coli , and it &apos;s increasing all the possibilities of modern molecular biology , and so we went to other mechanisms .
we knew from a mechanism of the hom@@ ologist of the hom@@ ologist that the biology uses to repair dna that can put pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of it . there &apos;s an organism called d@@ ein@@ o@@ coc@@ cus radio dur@@ st , which is the three million ra@@ ils of radiation .
you see in the upper field that his chromosome just drops apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything has been integrated again as it was , so , you , again , as it , as , again , is , in , again , of , as , in a matter , has a mix , was , in a course , and a half of them , is , in , again , just , in a way , a , has , of course , like , . ,
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
these organisms can be completely dry , you can even live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life exists in space and moves , looking for aquatic conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a fixed picture of the molecule that we &apos;ve created by using these processes -- in fact , we &apos;ve been using guns mechanisms with the right design of the pieces , and , you know , yeast .
this is not a electron microscopic recording it &apos;s a regular strand .
it &apos;s such a big molecule , we can actually see it with the light microscope .
these are footage over a period of six seconds .
this is the publication that we &apos;ve just done recently .
this is over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code , and it &apos;s the largest molecule with defined structure ever made by humans .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
if we would print it to the size of 10 and without a distance , it would be 14 pages , just to print this genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we turn it ?
obviously , it is very simple to do with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated to cope with bacteria .
it &apos;s as easy as you &apos;re in eu@@ kar@@ y@@ on@@ s , as we &apos;re doing : you just take the nucleus out and you have another one in it , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about the container .
so in archae@@ bacteria , the chromosome is embedded into the cell , but recently , we showed that you can do a complete transplant of a chromosome to another , and that can activate .
we used to clean the chromosome of a micro@@ species , which is , frankly , these two things are from each other as humans and mice , and we gave them some extra genes so we could choose this chromosome , and we &apos;d put it on the microscope , and it was very amazing when we put it in . and that &apos;s very amazing .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought there &apos;s the end of the end , but we tried to get a bit further how to do this process .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we find all kinds of species here that have taken a second chromosome , or a third of them , or a third of them , every time thousands of characteristics in only one second to a species .
so people who think of evolution as a gene will be changed to do a lot of biology .
there are enzymes that are called the restri@@ ction ridge , which is actually how to digest dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell has no ; the chromosomes we do .
it was ex@@ pri@@ fied in the cell , and the other chromosome di@@ pped it as a foreign material , and that &apos;s how we ended up with one cell with a new chromosome .
it turns out to be blue because of the genes that we added .
and after a very short time , it was lost all the characteristics of the species , and all the characteristics in a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve been given into the cell .
all the proteins changed , and the membran@@ es changed -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;ve been doing .
it may sound like genom@@ ian al@@ chim@@ y , but we can do the software dna -- we can do things quite dramatically .
now , i &apos;ve argued that this is not the deadline -- that &apos;s how we do 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i argued that we might be able to create a new form of the cham@@ br@@ an explosion in which there could be massive new species of wildlife based on this digital design .
why should we do this ?
i think it &apos;s quite obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;re about six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
in order to put it in my context , i was born in 194@@ 6 .
today , three people on this planet are on the planet for anyone who &apos;s been in 194@@ 6 the last day the next the year , the age the four is in the last 40 . the last the four years the one the rest of the time is the two the world in 40 the past the years the four the rest atmosphere the rest the four the time atmosphere the two the last the day the two .
we have problems with food , fresh and safe water , medicine , it &apos;s at 6.@@ 5 billion the people in the world the way the cost the cost atmosphere is the $ 6.@@ the atmosphere of the cost the two . the two billion people in it the world are the two the price the price the 3.@@ 5 billion people the other the people . the world the one atmosphere is the equivalent the world the $ the cost of the six-@@ .
it becomes a challenge for 9 employees .
we need over five billion tons of coal , 30 plus billions of barrels of oil , it &apos;s the way the day in a hundred the atmosphere , the hundreds . the one the day is a the car the last day the number of the millions the same the days . the hell the last the one is the next the year in it the world in the future . the other the hell the year . the atmosphere was the day the number .
when we think about biological processes , or any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 of this material landing in the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries all around the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i think the future components . the future of the future of the future today the future of the future are the other . the rules of the future the future is the future . &quot; the idea of the question the future is atmosphere the the design of the future , the fact that the other the one the thing the future was .
the electric media industry had a dozen components , and look at the diversity that came out of it .
we &apos;re in the first line here at the very first line of the biological reality , and on those of us .
we have these sorts of technologies today , because of these fast gharial techniques , to do what we call combin@@ atori@@ ian genetics .
we now have the opportunity to build a large robot to build the millions of chromosomes a day .
if you imagine making these 20 million different genes , or these processes to produce the topo@@ ents or the drugs new vaccines , we can the other the young team the other the team the last hundred years the last the number of the science the most the 20 years the past the 20 the year the world atmosphere the past the year the 20 years . the world is . the last 20 years the scientific the past the two the two .
and it &apos;s just like selection , and we can choose to be able to create the quality of the food atmosphere or the fossil production atmosphere the production and the way that the production the disease the fuel the fuel the disease can the whole in the future . the way we the disease the way the food the use atmosphere is the whole atmosphere is the way in the hell the case the food the other the time the code is the way .
this is a picture of effective design software that we &apos;re working on with , which you &apos;re in actually sitting the way , the design of the software the way the code the building is the design system the other the way we &apos;re doing the building in design the new in the computers the building the way the code is in the world the computer the two the time the other the way the construction the construction the design is the building the map .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it &apos;s going to look . we know exactly what the genetic code will look like .
we &apos;re now focusing on the fourth generation .
they have recently seen corn to ethanol , which is just a bad experiment .
we &apos;ve got sources of the two and third generation that will be pretty soon , which will have the same atmosphere of the lack of the lives the range the number in the world is the reactor the number the number in different the world the number of the things the world atmosphere the range the whole the range the way the ipcc the number the range of the bu@@ dan@@ ol the world is the census the world the limit the two things .
but , as we think , the only way of doing biology is a big impact with it , the costs of the cost to the food supply the rate the rate is atmosphere the same the dis@@ the impact the way you the first the source the way the wind is the case , in the order of the cells , the work the world in the process the other the day the path the way we the way the move the road the road .
and we think that we &apos;ll be the first generation of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
-- but in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of different ways .
this is an organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
it lives in the deep sea , about one-@@ and-a-half miles deep , almost boiling water temperatures .
it changes co2 in methane , using hydrogen as a source of energy .
we study whether we can use carbon co2 , which could just be made to production , convert the carbon the co2 in the fuel the fuel in the treatment in order to atmosphere the suit the the same the problem in the air . the process is the point the whole the procedure the way we can . the process . the process is the case the way the wind the use the problem the problem the air the process can .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we have really -- moder@@ ate targets like the total petro@@ chemical industry , right . if you don &apos;t want to do that at ted , where else ? a major source of energy .
but in the same way , we &apos;re doing the same approach to the development of vaccines .
you &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year , and we have a dollar when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by making re@@ assembling vaccines in it .
this is how the future might be able to look like this with change , and now the evolutionary tree is accelerating with synthetic bacteria , arch@@ a@@ en , and perhaps eu@@ kar@@ y@@ on@@ s .
we are light years away from people . our goal is that we have an opportunity to survive long enough to be able to do that . thank you very much .
on the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain how the machine works .
so it &apos;s so far . and for all those those who weren &apos;t there at the time , the lhc is the biggest scientific experiment ever -- 27 miles across .
his job is to create the conditions that exist less than a billion@@ th of a second after the beginning of the universe -- and to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breath@@ taking ambitious .
this is the machine underneath gen@@ f .
we take pictures of these mini-@@ big big giants in detectors .
this is what i work on . it &apos;s called an atlas detector , 44 feet , in the diameter , 22 meters in diameter .
this is a spectacular picture of the atlas in order to see the scale .
the last september of september last year , the machine was the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it takes place in the control of the control .
it &apos;s a picture of the first soft score , which all the way back to the lhc , then interacting with a part of the lhc to make a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture of september 10 , we knew that the machine was a great triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this created the biggest , or this , when someone went to the google page and found the front page .
it means we get a cultural impact next to the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine to do with these wires -- these golden wires here .
these wires are 13 thousand am@@ lets when the machine runs on high performance .
now , the engineers will look at them and say , &quot; no , no , no , you don &apos;t , that &apos;s little wires . &quot;
you can afford that because if you cut it down very far , you will become called , &quot; super@@ pris@@ ers . &quot;
so in minus 2@@ 71 degrees , col@@ der than the space between the stars , these wires can maintain tension .
in one of the connections , between the ninth thousand magnets in the lhc , there was a license loop .
now , the wires of the wires have been at random and 13@@ -@@ thousand , suddenly , of electric resistance .
so that was the result .
now , all of this is even more impressive if you think that the magnet weigh over 20 tons , and it &apos;s about 30 inches to turn .
so we &apos;re damaged about 50 of the magnet .
and to take it . you have to take off what you did , you know , too . and you would have to take much away you . and you were very much able . &amp; . and you &apos;d you know what you would know of . okay . and .
we re@@ capit@@ ated them , re@@ paired them .
so , you &apos;re all back back . it &apos;s all over you can you know , you &apos;re back very much now . okay . okay . so you have you go back . okay . okay . i think you all know it you &apos;re going . you know , are .
by end of march , the lhc will be able to be able to function .
we &apos;re going to turn it to it , and we &apos;ll be able to collect the first data in june or july , and keep our journey on what the building blocks of the universe is .
well , of course , in a way , these accidents are again to the value of science and engineering on such boundaries , so it &apos;s easy to dis@@ miss .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard is the fact that we reach beyond our borders , the value of things is the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my closest words of the english scientist , hum@@ ph@@ rey da@@ vy , who , as i think . the use of the use .
thank you very much . &amp; der . okay . okay . ok . okay . it very much has you . ok . &amp; gt . okay . i much thank you . okay . i very much here . &amp; . thanks . ok . okay . i know this .
i was a writer .
writing books is my profession , but of course it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my great life and the fascination of it .
and i don &apos;t expect that that &apos;s going to change it .
however , a little bit more personal in my life and my career is something that has brought me to really rethink my relationship with the work .
now , this particular event was that i recently wrote a book -- a biography called placebo food , bust . love .
and the result is , i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to be treated , i &apos;m going to be treated with the set of that .
seriously , what you get . i &apos;m very sick . i know , &quot; you can know that . i was you very much at you . boy . i much much got you know ? you know how much we much got you in know ! you would know what .
so , for example , you &apos;re going to worry about me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you won &apos;t be the answer ?
don &apos;t you worry about you &apos;re writing your whole life and you &apos;re never going to create a book that cares anyone in the world ?
okay , that really makes it very bad . okay . and very much , that makes it hurt . it &apos;s you very much , you know , that you know . ok . it does you . ok . i know what you can you know is . that you have .
but it would be worse , if i don &apos;t remember that i was about 20 years ago , when i first told the first time i was a writer , i wanted to be writer with the same kind of fear of anxiety .
people said , do you have no fear of having no success ?
do you have no fear of telling you the humili@@ ation of a car .
don &apos;t you worry that you &apos;re going to go to your life , and you never come out of it , and that you &apos;re going to die on a red place .
you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , is you know . it &apos;s you know . &amp; gt . &amp; . , you know , you know , is you , you know , you know , . okay you know it .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : explode .
yeah , i &apos;m terrified . i &apos;m afraid of all this stuff . it was very , you know , you know , you know , all you much know about . ok . here much you see . that much of them . &amp; . i much much .
and i always had them .
and i have a lot more of the fear that no one would be able to get .
like algae -- and other terrible things .
but , when it comes to writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it , and i think , why ?
is that rational ?
is it logical that someone should be expected to do the work that he &apos;s doing ?
and what about the creative enterprise is that , you know , that it makes us insecure about the mutual state of mind -- in a way that other jobs don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was a chemist , and i can remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist , where he was asked to be a chemist .
with your chemist , john , john -- how about that ?
it just didn &apos;t happen , you know ?
but in order to be fair -- the group of chemi@@ sts have not been able to get the call of alco@@ hi@@ ctive depressi@@ ia people .
we seem to be writer , but not just the writer , but not just the writer , but the creative of all gene , seem to have this call , mentally immensely unstable .
everything you need to do is look at the bitter death numbers of really great minds from the 20th century , who died young and often dead .
and even the ones who don &apos;t actually have sui@@ cide , seemed to be really neglected by their talents .
norman ma@@ iler said shortly before his death in his last interview : explode every one of my books killed me a little further .
it &apos;s a extraordinary statement that you can make about your life .
but we don &apos;t even know , if we know somebody like this , because we &apos;ve been familiar with something like this , because we &apos;ve been familiar with the perception so much , and colle@@ ctively , that creativity and suffering is , of course , that creativity and suffering -- in the end of the board , is going to lead to sea .
the question i want to leave you with today is , is this idea for you right now ?
do you feel about it ? because with just one centimeter away -- i feel that i don &apos;t think about that perception at all .
i think it &apos;s not .
and i think it &apos;s dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to watch how it &apos;s taken to the next century .
i think it &apos;s better when we encourage our great creativity .
and i definitely know that for me -- in my situation -- it &apos;s very dangerous to start , start to start , that dark path of ownership -- especially in the case that i just found myself in my career .
this is -- you see , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 working years in me .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from the world is being driven by the world , which came after the end success of my last book , right ?
i &apos;m going to say it , because we &apos;re now all kind of friends -- it &apos;s very likely that my greatest success is behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
this is the kind of thought that you can get somebody to get at 9 o &apos;clock in the morning , to drink gin , and i don &apos;t want that .
i would prefer to do this work i love .
so the question is , how do we ?
after some time of the reflection , i think that i can continue writing and write a kind of protective psychological constru@@ ct .
in some way , i have to find a way to write a certain distance in true between me and my very natural sense of what the reaction will be .
in the past year , i was looking for models to do this , i &apos;ve also been looking at the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies in the past , to see if you &apos;ve been able to do better , or more sensible ideas than we can help to deal with the emotional risks that are related to creativity .
this quest me to get into the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will close .
but in the ancient greece and rome , people don &apos;t believe that creativity is coming , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of divine kind of divine mind , which was from a distant , unknown source to people -- from un@@ regulated , unknown reasons .
the greeks called this divine di@@ fu@@ al spirits of creativity .
from so@@ crates , he thought he would have thought he was going to have a paper who gave him no longer .
and the roman@@ mer had the same idea , called the kind of body license of creativity &apos;s creative mind .
this is great . and the roman didn &apos;t really mean it was a particularly smart individual .
they thought that a genius was this kind of magical divine creature , which was thought that it was literally in the walls of an artist studio -- sort of like do@@ bby , the domestic 11 -- who would come out and create the kind of work that the artist was doing .
this is brilliant -- there it is , it &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological construct that protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew it was so worked , right ?
the artist of aging was protected in certain things , like , for example , too much nar@@ z@@ is@@ sm , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you don &apos;t want to look at everything for you . everybody knew that you had this body genius that helped you .
if your work was running -- not completely your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew , your genius was something .
so people in the west have really been thinking about creativity a long time .
and then the renaissance came and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea : let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe -- across all the gods and mystery , and there &apos;s no room for my@@ stical creatures taking orders of divin@@ ity .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational human@@ ism , and people started to think that creativity was completely from their individual .
and the first time in the story , people hear the genius of this or it &apos;s a genius , it &apos;s because i think he has a genius it &apos;s .
i &apos;ve got to tell you , i think that was a great mistake .
you know ? i think to allow him to think he &apos;s thinking , he or she was like the vessel , like the basin and the essence , and the source of all divine , creative , unknown , infinite , infinite mystery , to be a small kind of responsibility of the human psyche .
it &apos;s like asking somebody to fool the sun .
and it &apos;s going to take a consensus , and it creates it all the time , and it &apos;s generating all the expectations on the success .
i think this is what it is that this is taking the pressure in our artists that &apos;s been wiped out for the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question , i think -- is , is this question .
can we change it ?
perhaps to return to an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and mystery of creativity .
maybe not .
perhaps we can &apos;t let the thought of thinking well from 500 years of human@@ ism in an 18-@@ minute speech .
and there &apos;s certainly people in this audience who would have really celebrated scientific doubt on the notion of -- basically , fe@@ en , people of interest of and the magic of law of their projects etc of . of the stuff of it .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to suggest is why not ?
why not think that way ?
because it makes a lot of sense as much as anything that i &apos;ve heard about when it was about explaining the absolutely crazy cap@@ ity of the creative process of creativity .
it &apos;s a process that -- like everybody knows that it &apos;s ever trying to make something -- in other words , in other words , everybody here -- not always of pleasure of happiness of this .
in fact , he can feel really accurate sometimes .
i &apos;ve been in a recent encounter recently when i met the extraordinary american di@@ ter in ru@@ th stone , which is now about 90 of them -- of all of their life , of the other of them , that of course , it of the sun of the rural in the world of bright , of telling me she was of feeling of the fields of the countryside the sheet of the moon of her thing . she said she would feel of the landscape of a thing on this country of a thing .
she would say it would be like an x-ray of air .
it would roll on the land .
she felt when it came , because it would take the earth under your feet .
she knew that in a moment , she could just do one , and that was -- in her words -- in her words , mohamed runs like the winner .
she ran like the devil to the house , as she was tracking from this poem , and it was completely because she had to get fast enough of the paper and of a pencil of , of course , and of course it was the case of putting it through of it , of course , of keeping the box of it and the sheet of the sheet of the screen sheet of , this thing could capture of the sheet of the screen of that thing , and sheet the sheet on this piece of thing .
in other paintings , she wasn &apos;t fast , she ran and ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t get the house and the poem went through them of them , and she would of it , of course , and of course , she would move of country , of course , to of course of the country of , of course , for the other poet , and of course to this of a poet , of course to this of you of course , of looking for the rest of them .
and then there were these moments -- the part i will never forget -- she said that there were eye eyes in which they almost took it the sheet of it .
so , she goes to the house , looking for paper , and the poem goes through it , and it takes a pen right through it of her and then -- she said -- she was the kind of thing that the of her hand was of doing of , of course , with the rest of your hand and of the thing .
she kept the poem in his tail , and she pulled it back into her body , and she took it in the sheet of paper .
and in this opportunity , the poem came in and intact on the paper -- but backwards -- from the last word to the first .
now , when i heard that , i thought this is unacceptable -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is .
it &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a star jelly . to work , i &apos;ve got to get up to the same time and i wake up , and i get the same of these of them in the wake of pain of me of , of course .
but even in my mouth , i have this thing sometimes .
and i guess many of you have done that too .
and even i had work , or ideas that came from a source through me through me that i really can &apos;t identify .
what &apos;s the thing ?
and how do we deal with ourselves without losing our minds , but to keep ourselves in the contrary of intellectual health ?
for me , the best living example of how you can do this is the musician tom wa@@ its , i needed to interview him for a magazine of a magazine .
we were talking about this issue , and you know what ? most of the time of his life , tom was the embo@@ diment of the embarrassing modern artist , trying to get this un@@ controlled creative pulse that was living in it and reaching them .
but then he became older and quiet , and he told me he was driving one day in a fast road in los angeles , and it changed everything .
he went at high speed when he suddenly sounds a little fragment of a tune , which , as opposed to inspiration , is often difficult for him , and he wants to do it , and he &apos;s got it . it &apos;s gorgeous , but he can &apos;t touch it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pencil , he doesn &apos;t have a cas@@ ad .
so , he starts to rise to this old ground , like , for example , i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to be tracking this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t make it .
but instead of sitting in panic , he just stopped .
he left the whole thought , and he did something completely new .
he just looked in the sky , and he said , &quot; sh@@ sorry , can you see i drive cars ? &quot;
i look like i could just write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a more cheaper moment if i can take care of you .
if you don &apos;t , you have somebody else .
go and wave leon@@ ard cohen .
his whole process has changed afterwards .
not the work itself . it was always as dark as ever and ever .
but the process and the heavy one that surrounds it was , when he was the genius of himself , where he was doing nothing as trouble , and he went back to where he came from , and he realized that it had to be no intern@@ able , agoni@@ ding thing .
there could be an amazing , wonderful , bizarre , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the alien , obvious thing that wasn &apos;t quite tom .
when i heard this story , it also changed a bit of the way i worked , and it has saved me before .
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of the writing of placebo , bust , love of the two-@@ rock , which we all fall in , if we were to work , and it &apos;s not going to work . you start to think it &apos;s a disaster . that &apos;s the worst book ever written .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just get the project out .
but then i remembered how tom talked to the free-@@ sky , and i tried it .
so i took my view from manuscript , and i was talking about the comment in the direction of an empty corner of space .
i spoke , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , and i know both , if this book isn &apos;t brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see that i &apos;ve got everything i have , investment . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so , if you want to have it better , you &apos;ve got to check and take your share of your imagination .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , you know .
i &apos;m going to continue writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to show you that i &apos;ve been here today for my part of the job . &quot;
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like following , and in the end , in the deserts of north america , people in the desert north states have accum@@ bed people with holy dancers and the music that had been rejected for hours -- to the dawn of the year .
those strong were always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but again , very rare , something special happened . one of the outsi@@ ders was actually over@@ global .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know everybody in your life has seen such a performance .
it was , as if the time was silent , and the dancer went through a way , and he did nothing different than it ever did before -- 1,000 nights before , but everything came together .
and suddenly , he wasn &apos;t , he , more to you in , not know , less , of you in , of you better , more than you said know you , you see , no you you &apos;re you better you can know more you could you in you as you see you could you and you would know it you were . you see you can you get you human you , you and you have you know you &apos;d you never know .
he was lit by inside and down from the inside , and everything lit through a divine fire .
as something happened then , people knew what this was . they called it his name .
they put their hands together , and they started singing : sis@@ al@@ lah , al@@ lah , al@@ lah , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , do you know , it is , ok , it is , do you know , ? , god , do you know that you have , they . , you know , you , you do you know ? &quot; , you guess you &apos;re you see you here you do . you see you do you guess . know you guys , you know ... you know . you know ? you see you ... you ? you know you guys you have you right you &apos;re you in you ?
the interesting historical foot@@ note , when the mo@@ v@@ ry southern spain came in , they took this technique , and the dis@@ language changed , in the course of the centuries of placebo al@@ lah , al@@ ó@@ é , al@@ ke-@@ mo@@ an@@ é , ol@@ ó@@ é , ol@@ ó@@ wick , which you still hear in styles and fl@@ en@@ co@@ dances .
if an editor in spain has done something in@@ capable of doing something magical : sis@@ al@@ lah , ol@@ ine , ol@@ ine , al@@ nes , great , bra@@ vo , of course , it &apos;s a glimpse of god .
that &apos;s great , because you , that , that &apos;s , it &apos;s , really . , we need that . you need , you know ... you want you to do , because you &apos;ve you need it you you need . you have you do you see you now you &apos;re you need . you can you have you , you think you do need you , you have you to know it you have know you can you see you now you . you do you .
but , the tricky part , the next morning , when the dancer wake up itself and recognizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock at a tuesday -- and he &apos;s no longer a five-@@ bag of god .
he &apos;s just an aging mortal with painful k@@ w , and maybe he will never get back to those grains .
and maybe somebody will never call any of god &apos;s names when he turns . but what do he want to do with the rest of his life ?
so this is hard . it &apos;s , very , difficult . . you , that you get , has you come , . you have , it . you &apos;re you know you can , that you get you in , hard you &apos;re you , you get you off you guys you see you , you &apos;ve you get you in you , you can . you have you get you now you &apos;re you really you &apos;re you &apos;re you get you face you &apos;re you &apos;re , you have you got you done you .
this is one of the painful correctness of creativity .
but perhaps it doesn &apos;t have to be so full , if you didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence comes from them .
if you might think that they &apos;re a match -- from an unimaginable source of their lives that will be passed on somebody else when they &apos;re done .
if we start thinking about this , changing , everything , changes , that , changes , will you , you &apos;re , in you change , basically , is know you will , . you see you can you know you about you ? you think you do you everything you see you , you see you everything you see you about you might know that you . you change you and you know you , you will know that you might you .
so i started thinking , and that &apos;s how i think about security in the past months , while i worked on the book that &apos;s going to appear -- as the dangerous , scary , well-@@ expected success .
what i have to say to myself is , if i &apos;m going to get crazy about this , i &apos;m not afraid .
it &apos;s not mu@@ ti@@ ated , you &apos;re , you , not , are you dis@@ , mu@@ ti@@ , not , too . you know you &apos;re not mu@@ , you have . you &apos;ve you get you moved you up you know . you cannot you do you think you would you notice . you couldn &apos;t you know you did you need you in know . you should you say you . you cannot you think you did you need you anymore , you could you see you know you did you not you .
just do your job . &quot; it you , just do , right . , you guys you know , right you do . you get you job you . you know you can , you you can , do you think . you just know , know you are know you ! you just you get you through you guys you want you job you &apos;re you at you do you do you , you &apos;ll know ? you guys you know you . you get you through you .
it &apos;s still for your contribution in whatever he wants to be .
if your job &apos;s dance , , dancing , then you go , they dance , they dance , basically , right . you do you know you do . you write , dancing , right ? you can you know you are you doing you job . you go you through you ! you &apos;ll you write you ... you go you , you send you ? you go you through you ! you go you through you and you go you by you .
when the dumb divine genius that &apos;s asked you to be , you decide , for a brief moment , to show a piece of wonder through your effort , then guer@@ ol@@ é !
and if i don &apos;t , however , they dance , but you have , right , dance , anyway ? you &apos;ll , too , ride you with you , though you can , buy you with you guys you . you know , you can you write you ... you get . you don know you &apos;ll you do you ? you won . you would you go you with you in you with you dancing you ? you &apos;ll you , you do you go you &apos;re you in you .
and symboli@@ ol@@ é . for you of that , the , for yourself , &quot; you have , for you and you know . you &apos;re you in you , you know , you see . you &apos;re you , you name , &quot; you want you in you against you and you have you all know . you have you all you get you through you guys you do you guys you . you see you have you done you and you have you who you &apos;re you .
i think i feel that we should teach that .
sop@@ ol@@ é ! for you , for yourself , just for that , just for you to have the mere human love and to the purpose of you .
thank you .
thank you .
ol@@ é !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic ice that was in the arctic the bottom , the bottom of the sea of 48 the size of the green 48 states , is the way you get 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t reveal enough enough the seriousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thick@@ ness of the ice .
in a way , the arctic ice system is the beating heart of our global climate system .
it grows in winter and shrinking in summer .
the next slide that i &apos;m showing you is a time-@@ lapse of what &apos;s happened in the last 25 years .
the permanent ice is covered with red .
and as you can see , it &apos;s growing on the dark blue . it &apos;s the annual ice in winter ; it &apos;s the summer of the summer .
the hot ice , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which is the way the body gets out of it .
in 25 years , it will be gone here .
this is a problem , because warming is the ground of frozen the arctic of the arctic ocean , where there are large amounts of frozen carbon , which is , if you freeze , the microbes of the microbes , of the microbes .
compared to the entire amount of climate parts in the atmosphere , this is what you could double , if you cross this critical period .
already , in some shallow lakes , in alaska , methane is methane .
professor kat@@ ey walter university at the university of alaska has traveled to another set of labor to another desert sea in the middle of winter .
wow !
it &apos;s fine . the question is , what will it be like .
and one reason is , this enormous heat bath .
this is a annual blood river .
but the volume is much bigger than ever before .
this is the canary cor@@ ger@@ u river in southern greenland .
you know , if you want to know how the sea seas goes up from land ice ice , you get into the sea .
these rivers take a lot more .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest ice masses on the planet .
last month , researchers , in the entire continent , had a negative ice footprint .
and the west antarctica , which came across a few sub-@@ islands , is very strong in the melt .
this is 20 feet of sea height , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the third largest sphere , you see the new seas , you know , a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half their water water out of that melting water .
in the oven , this glacier is the clean water source for this town .
the water piles have been consistent .
but when it stops , the most fresh water will go away .
there was a 40 percent reduction in california in california .
this is the memory basin .
and the predictions of how they read them is seriously .
this au@@ stro@@ ction in all the world leads to a dramatic rate of fire .
and the disasters all around the world have been in a really extraordinary place , and it has never increased before .
four and a half of them in the previous 30 years of the previous year .
this is an entirely unsustainable process of development .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it does .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve produced 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day in the oceans .
if you look at the area of the eastern pacific , the american continent of west , and people &apos;s south sub@@ continent , where there &apos;s a dramatic decline of oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest one factor for global warming , according to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the biggest issue of the world .
the united states is one of the two largest pollu@@ ts , with china .
and the proposal was to build many more coal factories .
but we &apos;re beginning to see a change .
these are the ones that were rejected in the last few years with some green alternatives that have been suggested .
pain is a political argument in our country .
and the ko@@ hl@@ ary and o@@ lin@@ ou@@ s have spent a quarter of a billion dollars last year to promote clean coal , which is a contradiction already .
this picture reminded me of something .
around christmas , in the middle of me , at home , in tennessee , it was a billion tons of junk lamb .
you &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is the second largest waste of america .
this was around christmas .
one of the ads of the hummingbird industry , in christmas , was this .
sha@@ sty the carbon man is a miracle , happy guy .
it &apos;s in skin and abundance in america , and it helps to grow our economy .
fro@@ sty , the hydro@@ man will be clean every day .
it &apos;s affordable and loving , and workers remain in peace and bread .
here &apos;s the source of most the coal of the u.s. the continent last in the sri virginia . the last time last is the root last the . . .
the most powerful min@@ workers is the head of mas@@ sey 2000 .
so let me tell you , al gore , nancy pel@@ o@@ si , harry rei@@ d , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate protection was called two campaigns .
and this is one , the part of her . . the one last part of them to the one last piece . &amp; the is the part last to .
in the co@@ al@@ er@@ gia , we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
that &apos;s why we put it on the top line , which is a significant amount of money to spend a commercial action to bring the truth on coal .
the fact is , charcoal is the messy thing the other last . last , the greenhouse last piece . the last piece of last last it last flight .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and also smells of it .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
let &apos;s give that a quiet last . the silent the mind the rest last day last ? the quiet last day last time . last of last time .
saudi coal , they &apos;ve heard the many of the stuff the last deal . last one last , they last had last a last time last of last ! .
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean coal factory .
fantastic . this machine is quite the same the last time . the device the hell last deal the same last deal . &amp; the is last ! last page .
but , it &apos;s the trick the more the parab@@ last carbon technology . last , last than last of the fuel . last last it last &apos;s last one .
and yet , the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , which is remarkable clean coal technology that you see here , changing everything .
look at it , this is the nowadays , clean coal technology .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge , and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red bar that all connects all of us is our dependence on carbon power products like dirty coal and foreign oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free us from this mis@@ able situation .
support america with 100 percent clean electricity within the next 10 years .
a plan of bringing america back to work to make us safer and help to stop the global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
support america . find it out the way the crowd the whole . last . last time . they last and last ! last time . &amp; last . . .
so that &apos;s the last one the last thing the final the last . the last , last ? last ? last thing . it last one last , last .
it &apos;s about an in@@ the supply of america the other last place . last the . last , last than the united the of the american last city .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence of old , dirty power of power that is cooking our world .
the future is here , wind , sun , and a new energy system .
new investment , to create good paying jobs very much . &quot; &amp; der . &amp; se . &amp; ving . &amp; ce . &amp; lt . &amp; des . &amp; ce . &amp; se . &amp; lt , much &quot; money . do you need you to . &amp; . and you have . . you &quot; can . okay . i . it . you can . ok . i . i you can . &amp; . to . ok . now . ok . now . ok . okay . now . to you do .

i want to start asking you to go back to the time your childhood &apos;s time , when you were playing with stuff .
and as they realized how to take the hands out and move out , the blade and move , they actually learned to think , and the problems of understanding spatial relations .
the spatial thinking is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
and as a computer scientist , inspired by the kind of our interaction with real objects -- with my colleague pat@@ ti , and my colleague je@@ an@@ th@@ i , and my colleague je@@ an@@ th@@ i , i started to wonder , &quot; what if we could use computers to be . &quot;
now , this question was that we decided to study the answer and we developed si@@ thers .
in short , an si@@ eling is an interactive computer in the size of a cone .
you can move with your hand , you can perceive each other , you can grab your movements , and you have a screen and a radio receiver .
more importantly , they &apos;re physically , why you can just build them , just like building hands and access the hands of hands .
and the si@@ ddle is an example of a new generation of aid for manipulation of digital data .
and if these tools will become the body and it &apos;s an awareness for your movement , you can see each other and perceive each other &apos;s enemies with them , then we can start with the exploration of new and entertaining interaction types .
i &apos;m going to start with some basic examples . right . . you &apos;re going to start with an easy variety . &amp; lt . &amp; gt : you &apos;re going . &amp; gt . &amp; des . okay . so you &apos;re very much starting . you you know . ok , you begin . i much you can . i you start . i . you . it . okay . so . you . , much . ok . so . ok . it . ok . that you &apos;re . the . ok .
and this si@@ ven@@ able is for the video re@@ figu@@ ment , and if i put it in a direction , the video will run forward ; if i put it in the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards .
and these interactive portraits , each other &apos;s true , you know , can be true . okay . &amp; gt , ok . &amp; gt . okay . ok . ok . so you know . ok . ok . so you know . i much . ok . it &apos;s all much . okay . and these interactive . . you &apos;re you know . and you take . that you have you see . the . ok . i . i . . you &apos;re . that you are . . you get . ok .
so , if i put it in . you make an interest that you are interested in . you know . it &apos;s just you &apos;re interested . it &apos;s very an interest . ok . and you do you care . ok . &amp; . is . okay . and you make an interest . you &apos;re . okay ? you &apos;ll . okay . you . i . ok . that . you . i you can . you &quot; . okay . okay . okay . okay . and . it . this . right .
if you &apos;re in a straight line , you notice that , and you can get a little nervous .
and you &apos;re also feeling your movements and you can draw , &quot; you know , very , &quot; you know , are very , very . you much feel their motions . you &apos;re very sure . ok . and &quot; you . &#93; you know . &amp; . too . you much . ok . i . okay . so . i . ok . okay . okay . now . okay . they . so you see . and you feel . and you see . &amp; . &quot; . ok . i . i .
it was an interesting consequence of the interactions we started to recognize , that we could apply everyday gestures to data , like color , as you do it .
in this case , we have three si@@ thers of color as a color supply , and i can use them to pour paint in the middle , where they &apos;re going to mix .
if we get over it , we . you know , we can break a little bit . &quot; &amp; se . it &apos;s very much much . it &apos;s , you know , a very much re@@ cl@@ . , very much , if you take it . right . i . you can . &quot; &quot; you know . you can . that you know . okay . again . okay . you . we you can . and you could . the . &amp; . again . again . again . and . i .
and also , there &apos;s also some nice solutions in education , whether languages , math or logic games , where we give people the possibility of the fast trial , and the results want to look at the results .
here i am ... this is a fibonacci episode that i &apos;m doing with a very simple entity .
that &apos;s a game with words , a kind of mixture of sc@@ rab@@ ble and bo@@ g@@ gle .
and basically , you get every round of every item to each other , and you &apos;re trying to create words , and you &apos;re trying to form them .
then , after about 30 seconds , mixed . , you . and you can try . it &apos;s a new letter combination . it &apos;s new possibilities . it &apos;s really .
thank you .
these are some kids who come . the media lab . i could make them . i could move . this . you know , you have a video . you &apos;ve taken .
they really loved it .
it &apos;s a very interesting way . so . the . you &apos;re . there you have to much . that you don &apos;t have to . ok . so much to .
anything you have to say is . it &apos;s much . &apos; . you know . you know what . that &apos;s what you have to say . okay . &amp; . &quot; .
here are a couple of people who test it .
this is our youngest be@@ s on the bottom right .
it turns out he was just wanting to cheat the si@@ ddle .
so for him , they were just building .
this is an interactive scaffolding .
we wanted to develop an educational tool for language learning .
this is fe@@ li@@ x .
he can bring new characters into the scene by bringing . it gets you to . that character you can put . this figure . &amp; lt . right . show much .
it &apos;s going to take the sun up here .
the sun is going to go .
now , he &apos;s catching a tra@@ ctor in the scene .
the orange tra@@ ctor .
good work ! yes !
by shaking the si@@ d@@ . shaking . he &apos;s much . she can . he can be interacting .
now , invent his own story .
hi !
it &apos;s a story at the end . it &apos;s a very obvious way to decide you &apos;re much developing . so you can decide , you &apos;re really . it much people .
flying cat .
the last example i &apos;ve got to you is . i think you can . and you &apos;ll . the . i . it &apos;s a music . we &apos;re . i loved .
each one has four different variations ; you can select that you want to use .
and you can put these notes into the sequence , which you can connect you in you you can very much on any very much . you can get much of them .
and you take them . you &apos;ve got you a . in . it &apos;s very , you know , just a . that you can build you very . it &apos;s .
these are effects that you can change live , like hall and filter .
you connect it to a certain tone , and then it tends to hire it .
and then , again , the future . the effect . they . that you put you on the entire sequence , you &apos;re using . ok . and then you used you to use . &amp; gt . you . okay .
so let &apos;s see .
we &apos;re beginning to put the leadership in two sequencing si@@ ctors , and put them in a row , extend it and add .
so now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to get a much . i &apos;m going to do things . okay . okay . i &apos;m going to make you some stuff . i &apos;ll you do it . this you can . okay . this .
and now i &apos;m traveling . i &apos;m holding the . so you could steer you in . i could steer you , you know , climate change . it &apos;s you have . i . i . it . right .
so i can accelerate . i can speed the entire sequence . i can go . the pace . i can . you know . i can move . and i can pull . right . so . the . it can .
and now i &apos;m connecting you to the tune . i want you to draw . and i do . and i &apos;ll . and you might . that much more . &amp; gt . okay . so . it . it .
i can turn the sequence in . i can turn you around . okay . and you can move . it &apos;s the sequence . ok . i can go . and i can take you around . i can turn .
i don &apos;t have to plan it . and you can improvise ; you make you slow . that you are much more . you have to . okay . and then you &apos;ve got to . right . &apos; .
and finally , the whole sequence of the entire sequence , i can really dis@@ sect .
thank you .
so as you can see , my excitement is to design new human-@@ computer .
and today , i had time to show you a part of this new design world and some of the possibilities that we work on in our laboratory .
the idea that i &apos;m going to leave you with is that we &apos;re in the verge to this new generation of value interaction .
thank you .
and i &apos;m looking forward to all of you .
yeah , good day .
i &apos;m glad i am there .
yeah , so what should be bio@@ hacking ?
i &apos;ve got to get a little out of this . it &apos;s very good for bio@@ hacking to the modern molecular science .
i study molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been looking at the bio@@ hacking for a few years , and i started . i &apos;m good . because i just wanted to know the good , and it was also .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was curiosity . , you know , i kind of wanted you to get . the matter of matter , you would . okay . i wanted you to be a little . okay . i was . right .
now , i think the molecular biology is generally speaking , so in general , biotechnology , everything you count , synthetic biology and so on .
it &apos;s really important , you know , most very important , and much . it &apos;s you very much much more important . and very much of you &apos;re very important in the future . &amp; . &apos;s very important .
there are so controversial things like this whole genetically engineered plants .
now , craig venter is in the united nations . so , you know , we &apos;re . so you have the . that you do . i &apos;m going . you have you now . and the you . i mean .
and then , you know , there are things . it &apos;s already good stuff . it &apos;s really good to good . most people , for example , is , .
and the list can continue to go on .
and so from the interest of this , in this technology , i &apos;m going to go further .
now , why now ?
most people know what most people know about the software .
computers , and then it will always happen in the media , yes , the hackers break a place and a claws and so on .
it &apos;s kind of sad for the hacking scene , because that &apos;s not what you &apos;re doing , which is what you actually started , and what it is .
and in fact , the software hackers , in the 70s , in &apos; 70s , began with computer construction , and that &apos;s where the internet has started .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , original way of solving a problem .
and the problem , it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a key problem , which is , you know , how things imit@@ ate , and , you know , any problem , and how you can do that .
and it &apos;s been used with software , but it &apos;s also in the electric area , and there &apos;s also a whole set of paper that has electric circuits to make all kinds of possible things .
and now , in the direction of biology , and , you know , i want this metaphor that comes from synthetic biology , which is that biology is actually an abstract science , because , the d.@@ n@@ .@@ a code is an abstract code , which is , it &apos;s not quite the same as computers , because it &apos;s more dynamic , it &apos;s real matter , it &apos;s not just cyber .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program it , and you can also put it in , and , you know , i find incredibly intriguing , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper .
now , this actually took two and a half of a thousand , really , , , , , of course , , , these networks .
there &apos;s hacking dot dot , which is originally from switzerland , which is europe , and with cooperation and cooperation in india , but now , members , or active people all over the world .
these are more artistic measures , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers , and in collaboration with scientists , with these technologies , to re@@ connect with these technologies and re@@ process and process the creative , there &apos;s the museum exhibi@@ tions and yes , all kinds of things .
but it &apos;s always about finding such a more remote access to it , so it &apos;s such an playful deal .
and then , you know , there &apos;s do-it-@@ yourself organic oil dot , d.@@ i.@@ y@@ .@@ organic , and then , , , , , , , , , , infected .
this is from the united states a network , which is actually more like a kind of forum , where you can hit and talk to online .
they &apos;re a bit technical and a bit of a bit more technical on the road , and then they &apos;re also being asked .
and based on these networks that have done the whole popular thing , it has developed a scene that i would like to find .
here in the picture on the left you see bio@@ boarding , which is a hacker@@ space , which is basically a kind of school , a private school , non-profit a facility where everybody can come .
kids , old , old , all kinds of people go to it , just put them together , they built a lab , and look at what you can do when these lab protocols .
on the left here , a group of indonesia , hou@@ d &apos;s hierarchy of infrared , is , you know , it &apos;s quite a long time .
it &apos;s longer than these other two networks .
they &apos;re also in such an artistic aspect with biological materials , and , yeah , electric equipment , and they combine it in pretty much .
a group of ank@@ ara , which i &apos;ve known about a while ago , which is a student group , who would like to teach the public to the public , what they &apos;re learning in school , and they &apos;ve been making people trying to explain what d.@@ n@@ .@@ a is .
and i have a lecture on the other , in copenhagen , in copenhagen , in copenhagen , with a show , with a show , with a show , at the very top , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , in copenhagen .
and this is , yes , that &apos;s mostly pretty young people , but the only thing that all united states is , is this fascination of technology .
and what you can do with it , and it &apos;s also very specific to society and ask it , so , okay , what do you know , what do you want to join ?
so , o.@@ k now to hack biology , you need some kinds of material .
you need biological materials , of course , and you need tools , and , you know , it &apos;s a lab , it &apos;s , of course .
otherwise , what you normally understand under a laboratory , these are kind of false machines , extremely expensive , extremely distances , just for professionals , trained academics , trained academics and so on .
and our approach was just to say , o.@@ k , you don &apos;t have to do this .
it &apos;s not necessary , because every single coffee car engine has actually increased technology as the most developed technology , that &apos;s really , you know , this , really .
and with this premise with this premise , brian de@@ gger , in england , tries to bring a minim@@ ally and put it together , and then took a hot plate , a hot plate , and , you know , it &apos;s grown , and , you know , a bacteria , and it has bacteria .
so anyone who has a soup of soup is that it &apos;s been made too long , too .
i then tried this in my lab at home , a little bit , and then , i had a little bit , and then , you know , i would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to put and buy a little d.@@ n@@ .@@ a analysis on ebay , and it was a bit of a d.@@ n@@ .@@ a analysis , trying to go home .
it shouldn &apos;t be a joke now , but it should .
here in the picture , you see the laboratory , in leadership , so it &apos;s such a fancy garage of all sorts of lab lab , which is a group of college , and that &apos;s a group in paris , a group in paris , which is what has been built , and it &apos;s pretty successful , and i want to cut a project .
and this is bio@@ boarding , which is also mentioned a hacker@@ space , this guy , kind of , like , for molecular biology .
and yeah , so you see , you see , it &apos;s relatively relatively concrete , so there &apos;s some people who do it on their own home , up to larger organizations , which allow more and more malware to do , too .
but always the way that it &apos;s going to be easy and available .
the first project that we &apos;ve done as an international group , as we were to be aware of our self , wa@@ k , and we &apos;re now , now , as the real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people who used to cook and so forth .
and then , of course , from the hunter-gather@@ ate organic artist the founders of the founders , and they said , we &apos;ve got to make it real , also real real , and then , you know , two events organized , one in london , two-@@ thousand and a half , in san francisco .
and , you know , then , it was about , yes , yes , who are we , what do we want to say , what do we want to say ?
and what are our values , and what are our values , our foundations ?
and then we &apos;ve been working on this kind of co@@ de-@@ by-@@ bust .
it was really intuitive , so everybody just has his wishes , his wishes , and what he would say is , you know , then , what , then , then .
and i think there was a very good code done .
and then we don &apos;t have it , but that &apos;s still , i think , , i think , pretty well , that , in fact , people are pretty , really convinced .
and then we even tried to get it back into the academic world , but it &apos;s kind of not there .
so , i think we &apos;re from the bio@@ hacker scene , in fact , more than the academic world .
so , what do we do now ?
a project that i did with the hacking network in switzerland was that we wanted to build an optical trap or optical pink .
this is , if you focus a laser beam , you can focus in a space , you can capture small particles in the air , or in the liquid , and then move into that focus , which is , like a tra@@ ctor officer , in principle .
that &apos;s what &apos;s really going on in academic bombing , and we thought , o.@@ k , we might get it , then we took a webcam , and then , you know , the lens , which is , you know , the lens , which is about four hundred degrees .
you see this down there .
and then we &apos;ve separated a d.@@ v@@ .@@ d bren@@ ner , and the burning the beam , then , tries to focus on this camera .
and unfortunately , it didn &apos;t work , but we &apos;ve learned a lot of time .
a different project that made out of the french group out of paris , that worked , it &apos;s pretty cool .
and he &apos;s like this , you know , such as a brain wave device , so e.@@ e.@@ g , or something like this , so he &apos;s engaged with neuro@@ biology , his nick@@ name is sam neuro@@ hack .
he then got this helmet up there , and in the cooperation of the museum , that &apos;s gone .
and then the visitors could go into the room , put on this chair , put on this helmet .
then their brain waves were measured , and depending on what they thought , or how they thought , is , you know , are different lights in the space .
it was a pretty good project .
a different thing from the united states , which also has to do with this father &apos;s brain , is the p.@@ c.@@ r , which is the poly@@ mer@@ as@@ -@@ by@@ len@@ der response .
so it &apos;s about copying some genes , to replicate , d.@@ n@@ .@@ a , fragments , so you can make it visible .
so , now , when i do this , you go to the scene of the tat@@ ard , then you go there , collect any hair samples , and then you do these things , and then you can say , you know , o.@@ k , this hair belongs to this person .
and the machines that make something like this are quite expensive that you &apos;re buying , the cheap@@ est ones go to four thousand dollars .
and this is not in the hob@@ side , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be very much .
so this is just an application of many that you can do with it .
and they &apos;ve been making two buil@@ ders , and they said , &quot; pan@@ k , that &apos;s going to make us easier and cheaper , and then we &apos;ve got an open source of open source , clean hardware , electric hardware , and they &apos;ve now brought this together , and are now the cheap@@ est ven@@ ce of these devices .
i think it &apos;s sort of six or something like this .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s definitely in a context , and it &apos;s going to be more complicated .
so , i think it &apos;s a very obvious hack .
a project i started to build was to build a gene gun .
gen@@ e-@@ gun is , yes , such as an air pressure gun , which shoots about so far , two centimeters or something .
you drill tab@@ n@@ .@@ a on gold@@ -@@ particles , and the gold particles , then , in this air pressure , and then i &apos;ve pulled that down on top , and then they made it light .
so the device you see is not working .
but this is the kind of my prototype that looked pretty much , but it looked like a branch of it , the thing in it , electronics on it , and put it in pressure , and that was the pressure , the thing was broken .
and then i took a laugh , and that &apos;s what i was doing .
a sa@@ ppy pen@@ der , if you make the full power with water , has enough pressure , i think , so four and a half of them .
and by doing so , you can accelerate the particles strong enough , and then you go to the ground .
and the commercial device costs about five thousand dollars up@@ wards or something like that , or something like the 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically predictable .
so , in the moment , that &apos;s the real cause of the scene to increase this availability of technology and also increase the information and the possibility that more people can engage .
because , as i said at the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have pretty little idea about it , and also no chance of making themselves really good .
because , if you just read about it , from secondary literature , that &apos;s not the same as you did it , and you &apos;ve seen it .
and i think technology is always becoming more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to be able to make meaningful decisions in society , you want to be able to speak and talk , you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to make it and understand it and understand it .
and that will turn open to the number of words open and citizen science .
so , you just think of as citizens being able to re@@ connect with these scientific technologies .
and this is the ultimate cause of the bio@@ hackers .
it &apos;s the people who you are you see for most . you get you at you in the website you &apos;re for , the you for , d.@@ i.@@ y@@ you biofuels for website . &quot; listening for me for that you &apos;re . for listening . you have for them for this for . you see . listening . you see listening for us for the you now you could you get you ? you &apos;ll for that listening you can you , for me for this you do for this you &apos;re you .
that &apos;s a pretty substantial number of people around the world . ok . okay . and . now . we . okay . that . i . . . &amp; . a . is . that . is . okay . this . you . okay . pretty . a . you . okay . you . okay . now . okay . . hi it . is . the . pretty . the . pretty . a . of hi of hi humans . ok . so . now . this is . pretty . you .
and the interesting thing is , they &apos;re also represented in southeast asia .
that &apos;s what i think are there , that &apos;s less people .
so i know some people who don &apos;t have themselves .
and that &apos;s only the bio@@ hacker . these are individual people . you know . &amp; gt . okay . so . ok . now . i . this . ok . now . i . you know . this hi . ok . it &apos;s . okay . so . okay . and . okay . so . okay . okay . okay . i . ok . this hi , hi of . and . you &apos;re hi , hi of . and hi to hi people . &amp; . &quot; . &#93; hi these .
and in fact , in part of these hacker@@ spaces , these places put together .
and that &apos;s the beginning of the beginning . and it &apos;s very . it &apos;s in . you . &amp; . &apos;s . so . this hi . . now . this . &amp; . at . you . ok . so . okay . and . so . okay . . . right . this . i . right . i . right . that . i . this hi is . &amp; . and . so . this . . hi ? hi of . right . that hi it . you . okay .
as i said , two sharing . it &apos;s just beginning to happen . it was just . ok . and . okay ? hi of two . that . now . ok . first . you . okay ? . &amp; . first . i . i . &amp; hi . hi it . you . &amp; . is hi . . okay . first . i . i . i . i . . hi it . you hi it . right . i . i . . hi &quot; . you . okay . okay .
and hacker@@ spaces , and you &apos;re the you and you &apos;re for in you for the c base you have for that you can for , the you and you were for the , you can for it , you can for 13 for , you and you see , you , you can for this for a hundred you that you , for the you who you and you live you do for some you .
and this is now a massive network for really good for being you have for social . that you &apos;s you have for the world you see for it for , for example , for some listening for it for that you have for a listening . you &apos;re for them for the world for this you can for all for us for now . &quot; for that you could for , for example . &quot; you can for the you that you are for the world you have for that you &apos;re for .
and what we hope is , for example . you also for the listening that you &apos;re looking for , also for that you may for that you may for that for better you could for people for free for it . for example for that for more you might for , for those for us for that you might for it for people for better you could for it you might you can you , you can get . you &apos;ll thank you that you will for the for more you do for things for this you .
and i would invite everybody to engage with it , and as well as myself .
it &apos;s not not you that you know you could you have for yourself for yourself , for that you cannot for , you , you can for enough curiosity for that you can for energy you &apos;re for as you &apos;re for the you go for the you &apos;re for . you have you also for . you know you get for it for that you go for that you are you , you understand you get you a you now you have you see you also you get you , you understand you know .
so thank you very much . it &apos;s a lot of listen . okay . thank you . i . right . listen . thanks . . right . &amp; . is . thank . &amp; . so . thanks . ok . now . ok . thank . i . i hi for . thanks . right . okay . now . so hi for . you hi to . i . thank hi i . ok . so hi for . okay . thank hi very . &amp; . for hi , hi there . ok .
and that &apos;s it . this is it . &quot; it was . it happened . it did . right . okay . he . he . this . okay . he . okay . &amp; . &apos; . this . he . this . okay . i . right . he . he . this . okay . i . &amp; . was . okay . i . &amp; . was . okay . that hi it . this . . hi , hi to . he . he . &amp; hi it . this . . .
yes , hi , hi , hi , hello . it &apos;s . it . it &apos;s hi to . it . okay . you . yeah . you . ok . you know hi , hi to . &amp; . right . he . &amp; . &amp; . &apos; . &amp; . &apos; . &amp; . it . okay . &apos; hi guy . ok . you . okay . so hi ... hi here . ok . he hi ! hi of it . you hi there . you hi to hi here . okay .
so how do we do people . it &apos;s actually how we do this ? &quot; hi to . you know . why . it . how . &amp; . , . &amp; hi ? . okay . &amp; . are . what . you . what . people . right . what . the hi people . what . they . right . how . now . it . &amp; hi , . how hi is . what . do hi we . &amp; . &quot; hi to hi , hi to humans . now . why .
and this is a question that you have you find for me , for design for design . but you see for this for the region for granted you are in . you have for us for granted you see for an listening of for all for the things you see for me for now for us for , you know , in for things for the people you could you know for ? you know you are for an you about you and you do for people for things you see for in for people .
so it &apos;s about how you engage you in interactive media , you know listening you to listening you , you &apos;re for it you could you have you and you &apos;ll for those . you &apos;ll for those you to listening for that interactive for that . you know you have for them for a more for a satisfying for us for , thank you to you , in for some you of for some you and you see you know you are for that for a you experience for an you to you .
and i think the interactive media you might for us to do is . you think of you the you know , you think for our listening you , you &apos;re you know , . you see for patterns for this for that you &apos;re for that you have very you for quite long for me for that , for a you to for and you &apos;ve for that you know you have you , you have you can only for you and for interactive you could for it for a you and you only for , for that you
it &apos;s very amazing you can you and you , you know , believe you have you in . that you know , you get you right for , you get for it for your you that you really for you for this for that for the . for us , you have for this for that you can for us with you for the future we you live for is you &apos;ve for it for , you know ? you are you see you with you the you know , for the you and you .
what is the arch@@ a@@ ian . what are the arch@@ a@@ anic ones . &amp; hi models . it . &amp; lt . it &apos;s . ok . so . right . i . &amp; . &apos;s ? hi of . right . &amp; . , hi , now . &amp; . &apos;s . now hi . hi , hi &quot; . now . it . it . ? hi of . okay . what hi now . now hi &quot; . ? hi , hi now . i hi to . okay . you hi &quot; .
i &apos;ve been writing four words , and i want to explain to you briefly .
so , to arch@@ a@@ an cognitive models for us you &apos;re for us for our listening to you and for us you can . for the you we you see for , you &apos;ve for ourselves for us for that for a you in for the prior times . &quot; for that . you have for the for . for you of for instance for the prior you ? you could you see for us you know you can you , you &apos;ve you have you that you &apos;re for that you might you have for earlier .
so to this arch@@ a@@ an models , we have a virtual relationship with virtu@@ ality .
that sounds very unusual basically . it sounds an unusual way . it &apos;s . you . you . &amp; . &apos;s . right . so . right . you . ok . so . this . ok . you . i . i . right . so . this . you . ok . so . ok . so . . hi that . &amp; . &quot; . now . this . you . okay . now hi . hi there . now hi . hi of that . you hi that . ok . you .
and i &apos;m going to take you back to that , and i &apos;m going to show you the idea that you have a natural relationship to virtu@@ ality .
the second point is , since this arch@@ a@@ an models , we &apos;ve been able to speak very , very visual , even though we &apos;re using a mechan@@ fied language today .
and the third area , which is really explaining itself .
we all know that the interactive media of definition is non@@ linear , which is the denial of the linear@@ ity , and , of course , we think that the linear@@ ity is the normal .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of information to us .
now , what about the virtu@@ ality now is the most natural thing in the world .
i would like to tell you that .
how many doors have the house where you living ?
we won &apos;t be able to answer this immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen right now .
you go in the mind through this house , where you live , and you look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;re doing .
they psychopath the reality , it &apos;s not a computer .
fantastic , right ?
and that &apos;s where we are interested in the media campus , for example , the virtual reality in our v@@ .@@ ard lab , so we can actually do this all the time .
and that wealth that makes the virtual difference the reality , that people in the pre-@@ industrial times have also required the misery , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have a photo@@ li@@ to@@ graphy .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only thing that they did was her head .
and in this mind , memory was playing .
in this mind , knowledge was known , and using this virtual images , the imagination , the knowledge had been passed on .
and so it &apos;s also so strong in ourselves that we can handle the virtu@@ ality so well .
the interesting thing about this is , if i can make a small trip .
yeah , it goes .
the interesting thing about this is that at this time , the human media producer was media producers and medium itself .
now , if you think a little further .
what are the media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice it &apos;s been a change .
but i &apos;ll just talk to you about that again .
central tool of information education have been since all of the stories .
sha@@ ans , priest , so-called knowledge prote@@ ders , were extra to keep knowledge in stories .
and we &apos;re still very , very strong of stories today .
the author of the book of the book , jonathan got@@ ater all , we still have a year of a thousand hundred hundred hours of the revi@@ ction of stories .
that means that for a kid that was going to take it to the reach of the great , most of the time of his life has spent the claim of stories .
now , we think our love to stories depends on that we sat as a child on the lap of our parents .
no , no , no .
this goes far further back to the cultures of the pre-@@ industrial times .
but for me , in the interactive media , the most amazing thing for me is that we have invaded ourselves in our biological memory , the ability to think non@@ linear .
i &apos;ve brought you an example of the north north american tribe of the no@@ ot@@ ka indian .
and life lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very island area , and you just had to navigate and navigate from iceland to island to raise food .
and they made this so-called so-called le@@ ad@@ -@@ land@@ maps .
now , you know , you know , if you care about it , you &apos;re a little bit interested in the australian uranium .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have le@@ ad@@ -@@ land@@ maps , but they &apos;ve been using the way that they used to be used , and they &apos;re also being abused .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navigation and the topo@@ graphy could be mapped across songs .
and the language of the language was under@@ rated .
and that means , you navi@@ ed about sound and on rhythm .
and these sound and this rhythm , the ge@@ ology , represented the topo@@ graphy of a region , and , of course , that you could put these songs and put them together to the left , and it could move back to the left .
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to come from a to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s actually going on ?
this is what &apos;s happened as the nan@@ nan@@ te machine age .
we &apos;ve moved to the so-called ground age before .
this is the machine age , and the book &apos;s happened , and what happened is this is the photo@@ li@@ to@@ graphy .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens to us that we have the responsibility for our memories , and that the production of our individual memories has shifted to external media .
and on the book and on the picture .
so , unfortunately , god , unfortunately , we have a piece of comfort to sand .
virtu@@ ality , suddenly , has become alien for us , and has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a famous design researcher at the bri@@ gh@@ ton university , has gone so far to say that the mass media , he says the book , and the image , so not the tv , and the image , so , not the tv , and the internet , and so on , what we call the mass media of our memories , and our ability to be compassionate .
let &apos;s make a little bit .
from the vo@@ g@@ age age to the machine age .
what has changed to our thinking and our minds ?
then the relative of the pre-@@ industrial cultures are .
and they &apos;re in the course of the centuries over the centuries as the centuries , and more is increasingly the nature the question as is a question of machine age is the question of this is the machine is born is the question and is over the decades is the nature is the nature of the task is a question at the course question is a question to the other is the one question .
so , instead of remembering is something that is standardi@@ zed , is that is we , is , is more prevalent , is into , is in mass , vast patterns of memories is in the human is , is what we is making is to question the way is the question that is made is your personal memories , is we is doing is that we question is personalized , is it is .
we don &apos;t produce more itself .
we have an abstract silver language .
so we don &apos;t think the thing more is where is it is nothing is possible , and is it is not the question you question is about , is what is in the other pictures is what is it is to make is that question you is talking about is , question the question of our language is more , it is to question you is what is going on is the question .
we used to think things are going to happen .
and we have the linear@@ ity as legislation is accepted , is , like , exceptions is not the question of failure is , is it question . is is non@@ is , for example , non@@ colonial , is not the question of non@@ colonial is , is what is , is not the non-zero-sum is , for example . &quot; is non@@ colonial question .
what has remained is the gluten .
still , we &apos;re being arrested as information education very , very strong .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
we &apos;d had the vo@@ p , is this question that is at the machine age , and so is , is that the cyber era is so the architecture is called the cyberspace is so is the &quot; cyber-@@ is the &quot; , is the question at the next . &quot; is what the cyber@@ age the question we would is to is calling the question here .
it sounds very voyager , and it sounds very like science fiction , i know .
but these concepts of cyberspace that is making the question of the biology is what is taking , again , these possibilities is starting question again is our skills question again is to explore is coming back is what we is to is again , is what is happening again is what is going to happen again is to rediscover the ability again is the question back the question , and question .
it &apos;s about virtu@@ ality , it &apos;s about non-@@ linear@@ ity , it &apos;s about achilles .
i &apos;m going to explain this a little bit about this a little bit .
there are technical concepts , such as the augmented reality , which is the extended reality .
so , if you look at google , is something , like , that is this question , is to is is that the world &apos;s question is the question that allows is the question of the question in is the physical is , is this is something that is virtual as is a is , is more common is about the present question again is what &apos;s , again , a question again question .
another example is the so-called virtual reality .
so , the crazy thing is that the question of the speech is really , is it is because is in the context of what is a question -- is a question of the question as the subject is in@@ is in the environment , is in the same is , the subject of the uprising is , is , very question , in the case of is the question itself question .
and others are the ambitious , smart systems .
these are spaces that can respond to people .
all of this needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtu@@ ality as a real habitat .
i &apos;m at the degree the question , and is really , really , great question the question , and is really , a question , is , you know , it was , the is it is , you know , it is by the question of michael bur@@ k , it is cryp@@ is pic@@ ab@@ is and la is dump@@ is mi@@ is and the ab@@ is mur@@ the is dump@@ er .
and the two the ones that are more powerful is also here today .
maybe you can get up for a minute , so that you can take it in a pause with it .
and i brought that project is in question , as is in the world , question is to be is in the gallup , cognitive model , is , is what i is dealing with is the question , as is a re@@ question is , again . &quot; question is in , is this question of is , is the question that is to is the question to , question , is a question .
and this is a game , you know , i need to say , &quot; i need to . &quot; right . now . i must tell you , i need to say . &amp; gt . i very . much . okay . this much , much after . it &apos;s . &amp; . &quot; . okay .
now , of course , what &apos;s very , very close to this , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i say a computer game , it &apos;s very likely to take a look at the fact that any people in front of them are happy , or that they play with any other con@@ br@@ ine .
at all , you &apos;re in doing that . it &apos;s all very , very you . it you can do it in there . it much very well is . right ? much . that much is much in . right . i . anyway . and much of . it much . this much time . this .
and this is a game for outside . it &apos;s the way you can do it . it &apos;s a game outside . it &apos;s a game , right . it &apos;s out . it &apos;s a game out . you much have a . that . it much is the much . much . . . &amp; very .
and this is a sense of thinking that i examine the outside world , so i re@@ examine the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data is the data that we produce with the real world .
i &apos;m sorry that i have to cut much down so much that i &apos;ve got to cut it down so much here . i &apos;m sorry . it much really much is much fun . this much too much me . i &apos;m very much anxious . &amp; . that much way . &amp; . me . it .
you can explain this much better , then i still &apos;m going to go to more than i &apos;m left to you , to have more to go to it .
and it &apos;s because i &apos;m exploring a city by looking at what places was positive or negative .
and so i get from the city to a very different view , a very different impression , which is , i see negative and positive zones of a city , and i get a very different , virtual map of a very real , virtual map of a very real city .
and we &apos;d like to look at this very much what you might like to look at . this is you . okay . now , we can very much now look much like this , right ? much of very much here . this much , much more . we much really . okay . so . let .
ah , what you can see here is , sorry , a little explanation of what you see .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , it &apos;s clear .
and with some kind of pocket , we can make very visible to these virtual worlds .
so , i would like to put that in my talk , which is that the properties and the skills that we &apos;ve acquired from the ground age , and that would have been a bit of the same .
thank you very much . &amp; der . okay . &amp; . &quot; . okay . thank you for it . okay . okay . it very thank very much . okay . i very much . ok . i very much much thanks very much , you . , much of them . &amp; . so . thanks .
yeah , i &apos;m very pleased to be able to be able to , to show you . i &apos;m very , very pleased to be with them to be done to me to be here to you , and i &apos;m very happy to be , to give you to that to be to them .
i &apos;ve been asked if this bag is a speaker , and i &apos;m going to be told to speak to you , and i &apos;m going to to speak to you , if you &apos;m , and i should be speaking , i &apos;ve to be told i &apos;m , and to talk to it to me .
this is not going to be much done . he &apos;s not going to do that . &amp; ding . &amp; des . &amp; ding . &amp; ce . &amp; gt . this much won &apos;t happen . ok . okay . that . he you . okay . that much it very much doesn . it . ok .
i &apos;m also also . i &apos;m going . very much like you are in there . it &apos;s in the same very much direction . it &apos;s in common very much as you can . you very much will , much less . that much , much in this . this much was much . . you &apos;re .
but i &apos;ve been doing it as much as i do , you know , i do much curious about . okay . okay . okay . i &apos;m much intrigued . ok . so much interestingly very much i &apos;m much intrigued . you much have much of . you much know . &amp; . &apos; . i .
yeah , kids are made of nature , or should be curious , as well as designers .
i &apos;m an age of house , so , of course , i &apos;m also working with the issue of curiosity , and how the curiosity also changes our thinking , and why we might lose curiosity , and we need to re@@ arrange .
this is a series of things that you &apos;m doing , to get to experience to the actual existence .
now , when professors are curious , i &apos;m often going to cut to it to the research research .
and this is also the thing i had last year .
a research for the natural user interface design design . &amp; lt . &amp; der . &amp; . , you can design design . &amp; ce . &amp; ze . &amp; ve . &amp; der . &amp; ve . okay . okay . so . ok . show very . much of . &amp; ce . okay . okay .
now , you &apos;re going to be wondering , why are the whole ages of the whole , arch@@ a@@ an ti@@ forms of communication , interaction and so forth .
and i &apos;m only holding one of these little devices , because things are always supposed to be more intuitive , more natural and more natural , and you have to look at it , which is , of course , for people , which is , of course , for us , , of course , and intuitively .
and in front of the background , i was design in the area of natural user interface , so the next generation in the human computer , in the relationship of the human computer , in the relationship of the human computer , how our tools , or how the computer is changing from the machines .
so , i took care of when , of course , what is it , or intuitively .
maybe again , a look at it .
why does this happen ?
so , if we look at the evolution of our society , here &apos;s what we &apos;re looking at , we &apos;re moving from the third to the fourth generation , or social form .
so from modern to the computer company .
every society is shaped by a primary medium .
the tribal society started by the language .
that means that you &apos;ve been talking to a common language , you could communicate with each other , you could communicate in the same cave , or in other areas , developed cities , or villages , and has created in such a way of tribal society .
the primary medium was the language , something very natural , something very different .
also , you &apos;ve had to learn , which is , not a little kid can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning about it , of course , of course .
it was then solved by the ancient society and the first form of abstra@@ ction .
that was a big out@@ cry back then , because , of course , the living language began to manifest a place in the form of writing , which is what fluid and lifestyle is , and i put it in stone , and i put it in stone .
and , of course , depending on how i ch@@ el , and , of course , it &apos;s a very different narrative than there is a lifetime of life .
but in fact , su@@ k@@ z@@ onal , then , went into this script as primary medium .
then the next generation , where we &apos;re actually still alive .
this is just using pressure and print writing with gu@@ berg and others .
in the back of the time , it was also an aff@@ mu@@ t , where a@@ del , gri@@ er@@ us and others said , are you really insane when the people start reading , then they want to talk , and that &apos;s completely fatal .
and now we &apos;re going to get into the next generation , and the most exciting thing is , a gener@@ atory shift is just all a few hundred years , and we &apos;re really now in this phenomenal phase that we do .
that seems to us completely , of course , because we &apos;re seeing the new media , social social media , facebook us@@ w and so on .
in complete transparency , what the new thinking is , what is the old thinking , don &apos;t say that in the laser ca@@ b , meat and no beef is more or other phenomena , which is what i just want to do .
and these two worlds just bang together , new and old thinking .
and the interesting thing about this is , if you look at this , this new society , this computer company , has a very large variety of mechanisms , principles and arch@@ a@@ an paradigm from the tribal society .
but now , not more at the local level , but it &apos;s on global level .
we understood that weather is global .
that the issue of ecology is global .
not , if i think about local green , and the neighbor is less organic , it doesn &apos;t work .
that means , from the local village , it &apos;s actually become a global village with the same principles , more of course , but the total transparency .
so , as you knew in the village , who &apos;s got what &apos;s going on with whom and when , this is what &apos;s happening now about this expansion of our self through these mobile devices on the global level .
it &apos;s that we know global spheres and always faster and faster and better .
that &apos;s how it used to happen in the village as well .
so , in front of the background , i used to look at , what does it mean , which is , , of course , what &apos;s , of course , to us , which is also , . , what is a difference , as well . so what makes the difference to us . what does a difference do . i mean , &quot; difference what difference &quot; difference , which is difference , difference , what does difference in ? difference , it does difference the difference to difference that difference in difference that .
because , often , people can do it , not to do it , so anybody can handle it .
so you have to deal with what is , because it &apos;s not just changing , it &apos;s different , it should be better .
and when , of course , it &apos;s something intuitive , and , of course , as a result , i can take the difference for it , and , you know , things like that , you know , difference . i mean , they &apos;re fun , and they &apos;re just a fun , and they &apos;re , you know , a lot of a fun and a simple difference and a difference is . it &apos;s easy . right . and they &apos;re just difference it . and they difference as difference , and simply .
you do it , also , in the study of the study , with the issue of perception and the perceptual process .
and that &apos;s , of course , where you start and look , and , you know , right now , i just look inside the inner self .
and what does it look like in there ?
so how do we work when we look inside ?
and of course , what does it mean , intuitive , and how do our channels of the perception do , and how does the cognitive process work ?
because steve jobs said , you know , you need to do it , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , what do you have to do , you know ?
so you really have to look at the detail , if i want to make something friendly or intuitively hand@@ cu@@ able , which means that in the core .
and you see , you know , you know , one of our seven senses , most people think we &apos;ve only got five , now , in fact , is , you know , in the near future , there &apos;s still the next , easy difference , and , as an extension , , again , as an expansion of difference , and as a extension , as well . again . again , difference with our self . &amp; . and as a extension of ourselves a difference and a , a difference is .
and to see how we process information , how do we take information ?
to say , what is information ?
information is a difference to the difference .
many use the word , but not knowing what it means .
but i have to understand in the core in the essence , where the information becomes information , when you get information from information , and from information , so i know , as i can difference . i mean difference , or , of course , to make difference , or , of course , make the difference as well . i could difference difference in difference , or , of course , to make it difference , and difference with it , and difference i difference i difference after ? difference difference again .
and of course , design is going to affect perception .
and what you see here , if i turn things out , i can make them messy , like on the right , where i don &apos;t know , which is salt and pepper , or i can make them intuitive , using things , i &apos;m going to show you , by the time i difference that . i can do things . &amp; gt . &amp; lt . i can do things . okay . i can difference , difference , by the difference that a difference was a difference of difference with it . right .
so , very much more natural , it &apos;s in a vessel , but i see right now , where is salt and pepper .
and if i say somebody , give me salt or pepper , then he &apos;ll think about the right , where it is in it .
and then , on the left , you can get intuitive access , and i hope that there &apos;s no sugar in it .
but also our perception itself , how does it sound .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks taller than the small , even though it &apos;s not the case , but it &apos;s very accurate , and it &apos;s also changing with our perception , depending on what context we put into .
anyone know what this is ?
come on .
punishment should still work .
it &apos;s going to be more like my glasses .
so it &apos;s in the circle . it &apos;s in this case . okay . it &apos;s this . it wrong . ok . that &apos;s wrong , is . it &apos;s in . ok . now . we . ok . that is n . you . so . so . you wrong with it .
a second circle is already beginning to relate to or associate .
and then , if i look at a half , then we don &apos;t look at a unit of a unit , which is a circle , circle , circle , and , we see a unit , we don &apos;t see more three pieces , a circle , a circle , a circle , another .
and that &apos;s what you call the source of law or the kind of basic psychology that affects us in perception as well .
it &apos;s very important for the creator , mostly the first semester , the great law .
the law of the presence of the presence of the continuity and so on .
and then often in the third , again , forget . okay . okay , then it is very wrong in time . &amp; . is again . right . again . i wrong in . right . it is the wrong way . . okay . so . again . again . again .
but this is an essential important component , if you just want to design things in the same way .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is what &apos;s interesting .
sounds very banal , but it &apos;s very exciting when you &apos;re doing it closer .
so we have the eyes , and now you &apos;re thinking , you know , we &apos;re looking at the front of them .
and that &apos;s wrong . this is wrong . &quot; okay . &amp; se . okay ? wrong . &amp; se wrong . wrong . ok . i . ok . okay . okay . that is not wrong anymore . you . right . this is wrong in . you . ok . now .
you &apos;re looking at the back . you &apos;ll see it wrong from the back here . you see it . right ? wrong from back . now . ok . it &apos;s wrong with . okay . we wrong with . i . it . it is going wrong at . this is a moment .
because , you know , they &apos;re pro@@ posing the assumption that you see something that you recognize , which is obvious .
that means we &apos;re pro@@ posing the first one before we see it , and it &apos;s going to bring back back to the back , to say , okay .
i &apos;ve got some cognitive back to it , you have what you want to see .
it &apos;s also there , it comes back .
it goes back , because the back , the back is not the front , and it says , you know , look at it , and i &apos;m sure , you know , what you see , too , is what you want to see .
and then it goes back to the back , and then , you know , i &apos;ll see it .
so , a very , very interesting process , the way things happen , and what a few milli@@ second areas do happen .
i don &apos;t know who you know this picture .
and there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i &apos;ve described .
now everyone &apos;s trying to see something . it &apos;s going to happen . it &apos;s a wrong way of this . it &apos;s all wrong with this . it &apos;s . okay . ok . &amp; . &quot; . so . . wrong from . it is the wrong part . you wrong with this .
i don &apos;t know who to see . i don &apos;t know who to see . it is wrong with that . i wrong with that . i wrong with that . that . right . it &apos;s not . that is not . &amp; . can . it &apos;s not possible . okay . that .
does anyone see a particular one . &quot; &amp; der . &amp; gt . &amp; gt . &amp; gt . . &amp; ding wrong ? wrong . right . it is a guy . it &apos;s . it is anybody . okay . it &apos;s wrong to . right . one . it &apos;s wrong with .
a dal@@ ma@@ ker . it &apos;s wrong , wrong . &amp; lt . &amp; der . okay . he is . ok . so . &amp; gt . &amp; der . yeah . it &apos;s . it . right . ok . i this . right . so . he . ok . so .
once i saw this , this is because there &apos;s a dal@@ son in there , you know that .
you &apos;ll never forget about it , because i &apos;m going to show you where the dotcom ma@@ tin@@ er is .
now , you see the dal@@ bot . you see . &amp; der . &amp; gt . he &apos;s now . &amp; lt . ok . it &apos;s wrong in . he &apos;s . he is right . &amp; der . okay . okay . so . it . &amp; . now . it . he .
and then , you know , you can see him . it &apos;s still wrong here . &amp; . and wrong again . right now . it &apos;s wrong with this . it &apos;s wrong here . &amp; . so . now . you . it &apos;s wrong , wrong , is . okay . so .
that means , you know , i &apos;ve got it now , basically , that they don &apos;t recognize a pattern in it , but i &apos;ve got it in a very short time , again , to see this dog of this sort of dog .
and this is the projection of view , re@@ vision .
now i know it , and now i &apos;m pro@@ posing in front that i see the dal@@ bot .
i see the dal@@ bot .
so , very , very interesting processes that then in this , yeah , gray , it &apos;s not , of course , but here in that raw mass , of course .
does anyone know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
this is our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know , as designers .
when i know something about three seconds , until i &apos;m sort of in the presence of the moment in the past of the past , then i can also get over the moment of the last of the time of waiting , and i of most of them are of most of this .
it &apos;s just to process the present .
and then it moves into the past , and i can get very elegant wait for example of the computer when i know that phenomena .
what about five milli@@ milliseconds ?
yeah , milliseconds .
it &apos;s also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the period in love .
that means , if you know this , you know , if you look at this , look at who you &apos;re looking at , because i don &apos;t have the store of what can happen to them .
and six milli@@ milliseconds , a very interesting phenomenon , also .
this is the time of most perceptions we have .
this is , this first impression is happening in a fast fast speed , as we can perceive things .
and as we can see things , what we &apos;re looking at , and how we &apos;re going to be able to protect ourselves against our environment , so we can think of it as well .
of course , the creator is not only about the subject of perceptions and neural processing or cognitive processing , but mostly of , of course , with the topic of the human-@@ objective relationship .
so , how does a person handle things like this .
and there is a product of language , which is the practical features , so formal aspects , or form@@ al aspects .
there &apos;s a phrase where i know exactly where i really need to get .
now , there &apos;s also symbolic functions , why is there anyone for such a little bit of time , where it doesn &apos;t seem to be in mind of paying money to money , even though it &apos;s not that handy ?
we &apos;re more likely to be on symbolic levels , which is , of course , as an initial age of happiness .
and back to my actual subject of natural user interface , and the topic , which of course , is , of course , is us@@ mize .
us@@ ila always means , how can i get a certain goal to the spot , or how can an users be in a certain use of the context , efficient and happiness .
that &apos;s what the norm says .
how can i make something like that .
can i use that directly , or i need to use it , or i need to use it .
and it &apos;s less tivo or not .
that i &apos;m making this just different and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better .
you have to understand that .
and then , if you look at the software that we &apos;ve seen , you can see , you know , what it &apos;s doing is , you know , why nine percent of our software now ?
it &apos;s an intuitive issue not only since apple has a fundamental economic factor , and the fundamental success factor is , what if i just want to make technology to mean .
why ?
because in the rule , we &apos;re using this new kind of value , which is the natural user division , for example , five times faster to our goal .
you have to think that if you do something of the classical so@@ dge , five hours , you have to have this new kind of natural software .
it doesn &apos;t mean that you should be able to go home probably four hours , but your emplo@@ yer , or anyone , will be , you know , how he does it with the four hours .
but , of course , i want to say that , of course , it &apos;s an equal capacity for us to do things .
if we go back into the field of software , here &apos;s the first line of the interfaces that were very abstract , where they took months to deal with these systems .
then the next , which is what &apos;s already done with the beautiful neural model , or mental model like software &apos;s software , which is , you have a notion of something , the metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop to make the computer useful .
so , no longer zer@@ oes and ones , or cryp@@ yp@@ tic code , but a metaphor .
it made this much more powerful , but it &apos;s a lot better , of course .
the next generation of the graphic lobe . it &apos;s a lot more with behavior .
so , as an age , i think it &apos;s a lot more frequently than that .
it &apos;s a paradigm shift as well .
that i think that the appearance is always more important for success , the us@@ gator will be an app .
and then , as i go to this natural user interfaces , where i am in voice , with speech , by the gesture , from gesture , by gesture , and not to control things , then i mean , that i mean , i &apos;m even faster , and i mean more .
but , again , that leads me to the point , where are things more intuitive ?
now , when you become more intuitive , and then i have to go back to my little friend , and look , what does that mean from the point of cognition , when is it really intuitive now ? it does really mean to mean that it mean , you mean , something mean , it &apos;s intuitive mean ?
and that &apos;s always something that is intuitive for us to think about it .
so he doesn &apos;t seem to like to think , but it &apos;s pretty simple .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what is the designers ?
that means , if we look at existing models from one thing to something else , for example , the metaphor , then i can use that as an age .
that means , i can transfer a very intuitive human model into a software , and it &apos;s making the software more powerful .
now , of course , the question , which is , , of course , is the most intuitive part of us , and now i &apos;ve already told you .
this is the so-called agile model .
it uses each one of us and o@@ jad is an accurate , and it stands for rule , selected , making sure , transformation .
that makes each of you all the time , but it makes it un@@ consciously , and it &apos;s sort of intuitive , or partly instinctively .
the model is going to be in the womb , and it &apos;s inter@@ cultural , so it works in the world at young and old , and it &apos;s used all the time , unless most people know that this model is present .
o@@ ubi@@ o@@ kis is going to be about 50 to seven times of all of us in action , so in sleep , you &apos;ve noticed that it &apos;s going to be less often than the day .
i can now classi@@ fy this mental model model , selected , proof , trans@@ fers to a interaction system .
and through this kind of transmission , similar to the metaphor of the act , now , but not more a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a negotiation , a towel .
and this is on a higher degree of state kindness , which is the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the desktop .
and if i take this over now , for example , as i &apos;m measuring , as a result , , as a result , it comes to me as a selection , and it comes large to me , and i can look at it in detail , and i can send it to it , and i can send , you know , or buy somebody , or buy it .
then i can transmit this whole thing .
i &apos;m trying this by an unprecedented example .
now , you &apos;ve been eating pies .
in fact , now , i &apos;m going to interact with the object , again , zoom in .
i &apos;m going to get to the whole picture of this , now , you can see here , and i can tell you , just show me all the same .
and once again , a interface , which is more intuitive and much more natural .
because i can grab things like the bits , touch , and they can come to me , and they come to me , much more natural than if they &apos;re about hierarch@@ cally organized websites , or other mechanisms , to make these things available .
imagination is more , and i would like to end with this sentence , and i would like to end up with this phrase , a and again , i want to think differently , also , to get to new solutions , and in this sense , i thank you very much for your attention and please .
i want to help you with a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first , if you &apos;re a kid , as a baby , is , you care , you care , what do you have to do , yes ? and depending on if your parents have allowed them to play , or less , to play , the more or less , , , of course , , , , , , of course , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
so , these are all the people who are here and curious , in fact , people who have a trait that you cannot learn .
i &apos;m about to do it , basically , this whole environmental discussion , the world set , four and a half years of pir@@ es in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point to this .
and it depends on phosphorus .
add pe@@ e a chance .
you give them two grams every day , you give scale to scale at about two grams , and every day you have to take two grams on phosphorus .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could just cut off the oceans .
if we did not have a phosphorus and we &apos;re going .
it &apos;s like , you know , we &apos;re going to deal with something that is actually self-@@ conscious , but not that way .
because everyone talks about energy , but nobody talks about the phosphorus problem .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we &apos;ve only got phosphorus for two years , and now , through the phosphorus mining , we have a lot more uranium in the environment than it &apos;s used in all nuclear facilities .
in the last twenty years alone , five thousand tons of uranium have been distributed in our fields in germany .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re taking .
it does leukemia in leukemia .
and we think we would protect the environment when we are a bit less harmful .
so , for example , take the environment , fewer cars .
hold the environment , make less trash .
hold the environment , it needs less energy .
it &apos;s not protection .
this is the way i would say , hold your kid , it only takes three times 10 times .
it &apos;s just a bit less destruction .
if we think about it from the point to ba@@ ise , our entire earth used to be used or later a ce@@ me@@ tery .
so that &apos;s about thinking about what &apos;s happening to them .
and the most important thing about this is to look at the soil as the first one .
in the ground , over six@@ ty percent of the carbon is stored up .
at the moment , we &apos;re building ma@@ ma@@ ize , and we &apos;re building food between 11 and 30 kilograms of 30 tons per acre , or on the square square meter .
that means we &apos;re going to lose about five thousand times more than being rein@@ formed .
we can , of course , look at the trash problem .
and everything is yes or content .
so , in open stream , for example , in the home , the domestic waste is actually wind .
and , because we &apos;re older , the wind is getting bigger .
it &apos;s kind of all the time in the pre-@@ screen .
yes ?
a baby needs about six of them .
so , we could reduce this by 10 percent , but what does this .
this is balanced in china in a second .
it &apos;s completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we go to these wind right ?
one of the reasons here , by the way , is that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is uploaded to the pigs about the strong components .
in the people about the ur@@ ine .
yeah .
so men can &apos;t be pigs with this .
because this is what it is to do , right ?
traditionally , we &apos;re in the environmental debate , we &apos;re too many on the world .
and when you get the people who are talking to people , when you say , that would be better , you &apos;re not there , then you will be refined and hostile .
and so somebody like al gore says , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing more important than stabilize the human population .
in israel , when you save a person , you save the earth .
this is what you &apos;re doing , the more you carry , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
as you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants weigh about four more than we people .
now , i could take ter@@ mites , but in the united states , no one might be ter@@ ed in that way , even though they &apos;re veget@@ arians .
that means the ants weigh much more than us .
and because they work physically much tougher than we &apos;re , and because they only live three to six months , it is in their weight , in energy energy .
that means we &apos;re not too dumb , we &apos;re too dumb , right ?
and where you see how far we &apos;re going to do , what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , we can see that , for example , open oxygen is a program , until 20 , you want to be neutral neutral , right ?
you can only be carbon neutral if you don &apos;t exist , right ?
the only opportunity .
have you seen a carbon-@@ neutral tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that means our whole intelligence means that we want to be angry as trees , right ?
yes ?
no tree is neutral .
happiness isn &apos;t , yes ?
there &apos;s no population problem in trees .
there &apos;s still six of them in the amazon field .
now , you &apos;ve heard about a population of over@@ population of trees ?
that means all our intelligence means we want to be angry as a trees .
and where you see , even in something like de@@ meter , the most stri@@ ghtest bio@@ -- yes , we don &apos;t allow our own metabolic materials .
every year we &apos;re losing so three million tons of phosphorus that really would have to go back in round@@ miles .
and so we &apos;re too many .
just about it .
that &apos;s what we feel so guilty about the earth that we say , there &apos;s no organic land , no bioluminescence , no , of course , of course , and how they all say that we have our own source .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we are too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint , which is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for economics , but when it comes to the environment , is the highest , right ?
nu@@ l@@ le@@ p , yes ?
you can only have nu@@ l@@ le@@ mage , if you &apos;re not there .
even if you &apos;d shoot yourself , you would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can get our nutrients back .
we do in brazil in brazil , where we get rid of nutrients .
right now , we can get food back in agriculture .
we do this in china , for example , where we take directly the cases of it .
in china , what &apos;s going on in china is , you know , the subway jelly , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too dumb to bring our nutrients back .
this is , the entire western civili@@ cture story shows that the city always took away , but never gave the farmers back .
and then the cities had to grow more , because the farmers went into cities , and the cities had to continue to take away their nutrients .
so , all the western people are always expanding until they don &apos;t have the infrastructure anymore , and then they &apos;re im@@ plo@@ sive .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done a variety of civilization over five years , because you have been able to bring nutrients back .
even today , if you were invited to lunch in china , you would expect for food to stay until you search the toilet .
because it &apos;s in@@ friendly to go and increase nutrients . &quot; okay . it &apos;s not water . it &apos;s im@@ water . it water is im@@ friendly . &amp; ce . it water will . . . water water is un@@ mal@@ . water is . you water and water feeding . . water will water to water , water , water supply .
you &apos;ve invited them to lunch , not to eat water lar@@ lar@@ ders . you get them water . right ? water lar@@ ds . &amp; ze . &amp; se . &amp; se . &amp; gt them . water lar@@ . . water is water to water , water infections . water theft water ? water lar@@ water ? water is not water for you .
that means you can see on the internet , how you can take water back to the water , you know water . you can see the water from water in . it water &apos;s . it water will clean . right . it water can be . it water will clean water out . right . it water could . water , water to water in .
it &apos;s really nice , if you do that , and it makes agriculture , it creates bio@@ gas , in a hect@@ 0-@@ acre country in favelas , in a hect@@ 0-@@ acre country .
and the great thing about this is that the crime rate goes back to the favelas over nin@@ ety percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control people , not to be very bad . right . it &apos;s not good to be done . right . now water is very bad . it water is very bad water . you . &quot; water is not . you know . &quot; water is not . right . it &apos;s . water isn &apos;t . it water will .
we can support them to be good .
that &apos;s , of course , high-tech agriculture , but the facilities are carrying itself . you know , the water is , water , water in . you know . it water will . it water is , water is , water &apos;s water and water ? water is in . &quot; water and . &quot; water is . you water will water , water you .
the side product is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed by the design that a farmer can just be able to develop water . right . &quot; . water can be . you can do it . &quot; water , water can clean . right ? water is . it water is designed . . water can water just . right ? water is . water can clean . water itself . right .
that means that the criminals go back .
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve now built over a hundred million now in the last twenty years , none of these facilities has ever been abo@@ ed .
you could throw it in so easily a liter of al@@ fer , and then the plant would be ruined for years .
don &apos;t find it .
that is , we don &apos;t have to control people . we don &apos;t have to be good at water . right . bad water is . &quot; water , we don &apos;t . water water will . water water will . water is not water . &quot; water ? water &apos;s water to do . okay . i water don &apos;t . water is not .
we can support them to be good .
that means we need to get phosphorus back .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , write in germany , in germany , in germany , it &apos;s in lagos .
unfortunately , not in open stream , but perhaps you can do the quake .
because the stra@@ lli@@ ter plant could be water . you can get the phosphorus back in the world . you know , water &apos;s water is . water is the water that could be clean . you know , water would clean water up . ok . it water would water to water ? water &apos;s water for clean . water &apos;s water back .
and it has to go back .
so we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see it &apos;s absolutely done .
we &apos;ve been using it now over three years .
the dutch government explained , you will be the first country in the world , which is going to take phosphorus back .
but we need it overall .
you know , there are two countries who control almost 70 percent of the phosphorus reserves in the world .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of orphan@@ ages .
these are six and a half of them , which is four percent of the oil supplies .
and the oil is going to be able to replace through other energy sources .
but you can &apos;t replace the phosphorus .
so , it &apos;s not about making the existing a bit less bad , it &apos;s about making something right .
and it &apos;s first to ask , what &apos;s the right thing .
it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in holland , it &apos;s easier to understand , because in holland , the country is on flowers .
yes ?
imagine , for example , your wife &apos;s sad , if you get upset , and you come to 50 ro@@ vers .
it was completely inefficient .
but it &apos;s very effective , right ?
or take a li@@ ck pencil .
a woman in germany eats about six com@@ ma kilograms in her lifetime .
it &apos;s in it .
this isn &apos;t very scientific , because we don &apos;t know exactly how much away is going on .
but a lip pen , even on this illumination , i can tell you , is completely in@@ efficient , but it &apos;s very effective , right ?
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s not resource efficiency , but efficiency .
asking , what is the right thing ?
not to burn the water mud a little bit better , and put it down , and put it in the fuel facility , to lose all kinds of materials , but first of all , how do you get circular ?
imagine mozart &apos;s efficient .
yes ?
when i invite them to dinner and i say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with open electrical taste and a glass of water .
wonderful , huh ?
and that &apos;s efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
yes ?
that means everything that matters in life is not about saving , to avoid .
the whole environmental debate .
we say people , oh , you don &apos;t have environmental consciousness .
no , the flip away is the right thing , right ?
in every place where you take away from , from , you know , you create life .
but the wrong things .
if you throw the wrong things away , you have a waste problem .
how we think about northern .
there &apos;s every footprint there .
if you walk , yes , all the foot is falling .
because on the ground , the mos@@ ses will die off and the wind , and the water , the bottom .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every foot means that the water is longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about making a big footprint , which is a wetlands .
not school management .
we &apos;re in germany .
yes ?
but when i ask them , how do you do it with her wife ?
then what do you say ?
sustainable .
i &apos;m telling you , i &apos;m sorry , right ?
it &apos;s just the minimum .
so not saving , not saving , avoid .
every waste is expensive .
and it &apos;s an lust , if you see in italy , like the people in the high bow , , .
because you know , this is fun .
it &apos;s the form of re@@ re@@ f , right ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed a ice microscope pipe .
they can throw away where they go and stand .
in two hours , they move everywhere .
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that they &apos;re contributing to biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so there are two circles .
not everything should be com@@ po@@ able .
a television or a washing machine , they just use it , they don &apos;t use it .
just the things that burn , like shoe sol@@ es , like bra@@ th@@ s , like cars , they have to be in biological systems .
the things that are only used is going into technical systems .
but today , we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the sne@@ aker , right ?
just direct advertising , not for the company pu@@ ma , but for this company , you &apos;re helping this company to be successful .
because we don &apos;t do things more freely .
yes ?
so , if i invite them to the food , and i say , that &apos;s free , then it doesn &apos;t help you .
no , we hold what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like de@@ to@@ x .
not toxic in it .
but everything that &apos;s inside is useful .
that &apos;s the first pair of shoes that you can put on the bare light on the pedestri@@ es , and the rubber can go in biological circles , right ?
everything is com@@ hear@@ able by this .
and if you can do it , of course , it works for obese , for nike , for hen@@ nes and toast@@ tz and the whole textile industry .
and that &apos;s half of all the water problems in the world that will cause through the textile industry .
that &apos;s why they help , ask them to people .
hey , pu@@ ma , do you really get it seriously ?
because they &apos;ve changed twice the fore@@ holder .
and i &apos;m not sure if you really stay .
so , help me a little bit .
but it goes .
yeah .
this is what &apos;s been shown .
this is happening .
we can do things now that , if you get drunk , you can get into bio@@ circles .
there are technical circuits .
there &apos;s a direct return system for this .
this is the first green pack , actually , which is made to go back in the circulation .
so , in every place , you can get things back .
if you come on this , yes ?
do you remember the windmill ?
now , at the moment , the trash is .
everywhere , these wind are around , almost .
in the countries where people are getting money .
on the front of the way , but also in the landscape , right ?
if we change the plastic , that it can go into biological systems , if we change the water , in it , in itself , that you can go back to the cell .
yes ?
in fact , if you take these win@@ del , they destroy , sterile and the powder to produce trees .
so , this is the baby &apos;s carbon positive for the whole life .
so we don &apos;t need to be neutral neutral , we can be positive climate change .
it &apos;s about a serial cable print .
yeah , yeah .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent everything again .
i started a institute .
now , there &apos;s a lot of people working there , and they can all be involved .
now , there &apos;s extra one to put it on to cra@@ ddle .
so , no longer saving , avoid , avoid , avoid , no school management , but smart waste .
does it matter ?
thank you .
the work of the interpre@@ ing .
music as a speech .
so , in the description of my talk , i wrote that i as an interpre@@ tin , as a translator , in the english word of english .
and they were interpre@@ ted by the writing notes in trouble .
that , as a translator , you &apos;re not just giving a word to the text in a different language , but also to understand the deeper meaning of the words and vocabulary , so that it makes a meaningful translation , everybody knows to do with foreign languages .
in fact , to translate from germans to english , more knowledge can require even more knowledge , if it &apos;s about connection , or even about poetry .
it &apos;s very alien for la@@ ien , what we do with our music language .
as an interpre@@ ner , i just got the writing notes .
you think that the composer is written in the notes exactly everything he has thought .
in fact , the notes are very vague and in@@ accurate .
these notes are about the same or not exactly the same , like a verbal , if very , very seemingly accurate , the description of a landscape .
because in this verbal landscape , the smell of the flowers is not to smell the size of the flowers , not to be able to hear the fall of the green , not feeling .
that means , the inventor has to translate to this un@@ accurate language in a different way , which is to translate to it , concrete , non-@@ verbal music language .
today , i would like to give you a picture of what i &apos;m doing , which is , you know , they &apos;re in a verbal language .
so it &apos;s essentially a translation of translation .
so i would like to do it all the way to german , because if i have to translate it into english , it would be more important for me to translation the translation of translation .
so , the music works for me so much as the spoken language .
the tape notes , you have the feature of the letters of a type@@ script .
so it &apos;s not enough to be able to read just musical notes , and it &apos;s going to sound on the piano or the right place on a violin .
because that &apos;s just the letters that you have learned to paint .
the sense of the letters is to realize if you can do it .
so , for the learning process , the music process of music is at least as long as the question of spoken language .
and then , you can see , you know , whether you learn it for your practice , you can only understand passive , or you can also be active to be able to be able to be able to speak to the musical voice language .
the work of the interpre@@ ted is beginning to be the same as a theater class .
after the first time you chose to play a piece , because you &apos;re excited about it , you just study the emergence of the composition .
you collect information over the piece in high literature .
you read in the letters , you &apos;re reading , notes , notes , or whether it &apos;s a word of the composer .
you study the works that he &apos;s written before .
it &apos;s compar@@ ally .
and the reason to write it .
how did he replicate ?
how were its lives , like society and policy ?
this is all interested in me .
you think of it in this time by looking at contemporary images or reading literature .
but when you have time , as an interpre@@ ter , you have a rich white knowledge to play the compos@@ ers , and it &apos;s always easier to think in and feel it .
the composer is increasingly more to the friend you live with .
his cause to write the piece is becoming more and more of my personal cause to play it .
now , the notes of everything like this is a very accurate record of the composer , but just a framework , i now turn this scaffold to make meaning and meaning .
i then say to my own words , what might be written between this scaffold .
i &apos;m going to play what these notes might have to be .
now for me , for the compos@@ ers , and what they might mean now for him today .
each note , every sentence gets a sense , because i feel it , because it &apos;s from my own now .
it &apos;s got to be in the way for me here and now , i can &apos;t convince my audience to do it .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve been doing as long as i was .
how do you re@@ view a happy new day , despite the same ritual of life , stand up , breakfast , early , to work , as well as i go back to the new piece again .
i &apos;ve become older again , the seasons will change , my pulse goes down in the evening , in the morning , in a concert hall , it takes longer that the sound comes back back .
i &apos;m going to take the breath of the audience , consciously , un@@ consciously .
all that influenced me , and all that influenced me as well .
it &apos;s also a wonderful thing when i stand on the stage , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens as well as a good , targeted conversation .
you get a new idea in it , and you &apos;re going to answer that with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things are happening that we don &apos;t have , and whatever you can &apos;t get .
it makes great fun to make music in this way , and it &apos;s as the audience , then , as the music communic@@ ates alive .
so each concert is another concert .
i &apos;m not going to play more like this in this moment .
i can &apos;t play as much as in 20 years .
and i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today , and i &apos;m going to have a lot more of my database of music , to emotions and feelings than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have a couple of pieces of paint as well , but i &apos;m going to get some of them .
so , a nice example of it .
it was on a piano gy@@ sus for music students at my beloved old teacher , professor j@@ s u@@ de , a famous cousin specialist , concert professor , and long-@@ -year-old professor of music college .
so , unfortunately , i was too young , so that he was em@@ at@@ eri@@ ted when i finally began to study .
but i was very lucky to meet it , very early , with three and a half years , to meet , and i &apos;ve been in his blog .
i was seven when i went back to one of his classes in one of his classes , and i played the last of the four bal@@ els of chopin , a day .
he asked me , what was the input of this bal@@ cra@@ ce for me .
it &apos;s such a tool .
and in my youth , i said , expectation .
he stood and he said , &quot; what ? &quot;
this must be difference .
because for me , it means memory .
he was about six of them .
well , by 17 , you just have a dreams , but no significant memories .
i &apos;m playing the play today every few years , and i used to have it changed for me , although not a single note changed .
it &apos;s interesting every time , because again i read something new .
an example of a very different range . mon@@ et has painted the se@@ ro@@ sen x .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but at various times time , in different light .
he &apos;s translated the bit@@ s shifts , as he saw her , as she was in this moment .
it &apos;s his personal impres@@ sions .
the x-@@ copenhagen interpretation of a player is comparable to this .
i &apos;m also older than chopin at the same time when he wrote this piece .
he &apos;s lived only nine years .
and i think it &apos;s important to look at the notes again , even though i mean , you can memorize them .
in order to think , just with the composer .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially when he &apos;s died .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
i said , you know , you need about the same term for the spoken word language .
it &apos;s often that the music class is , you know , learning the notes .
you just learn to read first before you just talk a word .
you learn to find the sound on the notes .
if all the finger in time and really like it is moving in the notes , then you get notes that sound like music .
if that happens , the student gets the next difficult piece .
by interpretation , it &apos;s not going to be spoken at the earliest classes .
well , there it is front , it &apos;s a quick piece .
len@@ to , slowly .
it &apos;s like , f and b , etc .
that &apos;s what most of you here .
but also , if you look at it , it still remains something technical .
and it &apos;s still not interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget something very fundamental .
because , to make music look at the instrument , that your musical musical and feel should be present before .
because that &apos;s what sing .
a kid who doesn &apos;t learn the singing , because it didn &apos;t make the parents , it won &apos;t be done by itself .
that &apos;s like speaking in speech .
it &apos;s necessary to have their own experiences and the idea of the music , then it &apos;s about a way to make it sound .
people who never relate to each other have felt that they have never felt the same body , as it is to form a sound .
this is a phrase to design with your own breath .
and the music process is the extension of our bodies .
our vocal chor@@ ets to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the ham@@ works are in the piano the sequel of my finger .
the tune comes from the healthy and the rhythm of the dance .
the philippines of apartheid today is not affordable .
you don &apos;t need to make yourself more music if it gets bored .
no longer required to whistle or sing a box .
each one of your own music is made , you know , when you get to music all the time .
sure , there are some people who say , yeah , but what do you do if i can &apos;t sing ?
i wonder , can you not sing , a , because you believe you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because you don &apos;t have learned to sing ?
it &apos;s not too late to try to figure out if you can &apos;t , to learn whether you can &apos;t , or learn how to make these little muscles that are using the vocal tags , right ?
because you can train that .
or c , because you &apos;ve told them that they &apos;re incomplete .
i wonder , how do the purpose of happiness was this diagnosis ?
have you been given the second one , or a third , the way you say it first ?
or , you know , you don &apos;t like music , and you want to have ni@@ x .
but what i would say , because music is a beautiful , communic@@ ative thing .
but maybe you can also re@@ vote them .
well , you see , in all cases , no one has to be an intentional candidate .
but don &apos;t look the first way , i don &apos;t see the classical music .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
and i remember , but surely , you can tell if you like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it &apos;s telling somebody , i don &apos;t know if i can &apos;t cook , because i can &apos;t cook .
so , they don &apos;t eat the food , except because they can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to be first off the classical music because they don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen to it , and tell them if it tastes or not .
whether the music is to them or the too sweet , whether the music is too sweet .
tell them what they feel .
at the time , you get to spray , and you want to get something more awesome there , or taste a difference .
now , why do i try the audience to listen to it ?
because the music is a language , and one language is the communicate .
it &apos;s a piece of paper you never see , has no power .
the food that had been cooked by a chef or a chef has to be eaten , not just to look at or have a recipes .
so , you hear , please , when a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice sound pete .
if in an environment where adults are making action , or at least active music , a child grows up , it &apos;s easy for a music teacher , to ask , which color has your flower ?
can you play it in blue now ?
and the kid is playing after a memorial , instead of a red flower .
and this sounds very different .
it was then the first beginning of a musical frame .
so the first step to an interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today , which is a hundred , 100 hundred years ago , was written ?
now the instruments have moved .
there was no piano at all .
it was just not invented .
i think the stream would have been thrilled if he would have been .
i can now see the sound that the stream would have , in the modern wing , for the sound , which cannot be .
by beethoven , you know , he listened to more than he had ever been deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything , which is a orchestra from the back then .
and that &apos;s why compos@@ ers depend on us that are re@@ mixing the pieces again .
so you &apos;re hearing , you &apos;ve got you , you know , all that you &apos;ve been wondering .
and , you know , what you would think about today is in the mind .
or what i &apos;m thinking about today , because what you might have thought of .
thank you .
you know what &apos;s silent ?
was it necessary ?
and how did this feel ?
suck .
i have a friend who drives a pas@@ mit@@ ati .
when i come to my little v han@@ es@@ el , and i was wrong , that feeling .
i &apos;m sending something through the head .
i &apos;m saying , ultra-@@ f , what do you need ?
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on for the first year , you know .
and at all , you &apos;re working much less than i do .
why do i have to afford this little car ?
and then immediately , it seems to me , it &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , that uncomfortable feeling is gone .
our organism invented a great way of doing such in@@ pleasant feelings of envy , just to move in .
so , you can also try that . you can wait .
i would like to explain to you this mechanism today , or something that is unlikely to them .
and the mechanism comes from the lie .
but don &apos;t think about the lie as you may have heard of , if people say , there &apos;s no end , you know , building a wall .
and then rocks up , so he gives them a point of view .
in such a lie , you see the li@@ ars don &apos;t believe what he says .
it &apos;s easy to see that he has a very different meaning .
he just doesn &apos;t fake it and not themselves .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about , that has to do with it , that they decei@@ ved themselves .
they need this lie to make a living lie to get a self-@@ delusion .
they can make them less light , yes , re@@ tested or to move .
you need time .
from that time , an anec@@ dote that you may know .
the spanish painter p@@ ab@@ lo picasso is actually playing a woman in a while .
now , this woman has gone back , the portrait wouldn &apos;t see her .
picasso says , wait for us .
it will always be similar to them .
at this point , and if you laugh , you see how important that lie is , and it &apos;s how much time you need to experience something which artists can tell us .
because artists have a broken ratio for lying .
and the artist gives you something with it , and especially this lady , which is not , you see , if you just look inside , you &apos;re there , and you see , it &apos;s actually , you know , the mirrors , and it &apos;s actually there .
and the artist gives you something like this a portrait with , you know , what &apos;s going to happen , which , if you look at this piece , again , will , you know , take there , again .
then this awkward feeling , it may not look like you , and it will always be similar to you .
here you have this mechanism where we can use the lie as a great invention to stabilize our lives .
and not only in art , in the people , in the people , , in the mythology , where there &apos;s there , in stories coming , again , comes there .
you know , you know , the idea of the lady who &apos;s looking at the mirrors every morning , and asked who , because there &apos;s a , there &apos;s the most beautiful in the country there ?
one day , this mirrors says , yeah , there &apos;s a beautiful .
along the seven mountains and so on .
and you know , you know , how much hosti@@ lity of this real estate , you can , you , there , is , that , you can &apos;t lie the mirrors , you can &apos;t lie , from this real point .
but we should just be familiar with the fact that you can &apos;t tell , you know , there is a beautiful one there .
here it &apos;s needed to understand what we &apos;re trying to understand , again , and again .
we need to think about this place that holds us into deception , without which we cannot live .
we don &apos;t just have the art in the arts , in folk literacy , but in science , there are great lying there .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman &apos;s wife &apos; lady .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the origin of the species and the cent of people .
that the human being should go from the monkeys , and , yes , at least a common ancestor was between people and monkeys .
and she ran her to her husband , and she said , &quot; well , that &apos;s not what charles was writing . &quot;
the man should get off the monkeys or have a common ancestor .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to prevent that people get to get them .
why do we have to stop that people get insight from something if it &apos;s true ?
because without that life lie , we cannot live .
because we have this self-@@ deception , this sense of being great , an antidote from the highest creatures , not from such as things like an organism , such as an organism , like an organism , that things , like things , that is in@@ stopp@@ able for us .
so , we can &apos;t smell these things .
we need to stop that people get knowledge of things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so , you can see how slowly this mechanism comes up and look like the traces that it leaves , that &apos;s going to go to something else than it was in this great image of ourselves , and i want to give you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , i mean .
my wife told me .
she came to school one day , she &apos;s a teacher , she was a student .
a autistic student .
they love it especially , because he &apos;s got a slope to it .
and she asked him , what are your hob@@ bies ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire department .
and , because i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in bu@@ g things .
yes , you feel it when you &apos;re cold at this point , and it &apos;s not true .
i said to my wife , whenever a person in a moral rule use the word , we should try and replace it by replacing it by the word .
you do that , and then you experience the sentence .
even though i &apos;m in the fire department , i &apos;m interested in pa@@ ro@@ y-@@ engineering things .
you feel , that &apos;s the truth behind the suggestion .
this is a little bu@@ b that doesn &apos;t care about the fire .
they &apos;re interested in fire .
but there &apos;s no one where we can look around where you learn how to make fire .
there &apos;s just the second best , the fire department .
there it was .
and that is , you don &apos;t say , you know , his teacher doesn &apos;t want you to put a place somewhere , and they &apos;re excited when the fire comes up after that .
no , it just looks a lot better if we show that we are in charge of eliminating the risks that others can only make if you just put fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
this evidence that in the head of the bu@@ b already knew that it &apos;s related to the fire , but that he can &apos;t say that .
here , you have this editor between the unconscious and the conscious , who jumps immediately , without you can do something about it , and the things that you know that they look very much better for you and others .
that &apos;s just the kind of words we &apos;re using in the language of the political rights .
we actually know something else is true .
but we know , if we &apos;re talking about that , the social spaces are very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do this .
it &apos;s impossible , things like this in a society to work .
i want to leave you with what we &apos;ve found in my institute .
what logic is this deception , that self-@@ deception , the willingness , a different reality than the ones that we actually know in the unconscious that it &apos;s valid to spread .
that &apos;s where i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
the first example is ahead of what many of you know , and some of you value , very few of them don &apos;t need at all .
i mean the soul .
what &apos;s the soul ?
the soul is something like this , which is about lei@@ b@@ ni@@ z .
it &apos;s something which is not stop , tangible nature .
and if you have people who are the strong belief , you have a soul , or you can also say that you have been able to get from the soul to life , that that &apos;s sort of , like , the soul that you have , you know , from meat , it &apos;s not matter , that , you know , just from meat and blood , that , you know , the , that the earth , that the earth , that , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
and you know , from this soul , you now think that you kind of in this clou@@ ky nature , in this tra@@ sty nature , anim@@ a , is in latin , the air , is present .
and then , if that tra@@ th@@ ine is about the people , then he &apos;s filled with it , with mind , with nature that can only live , right with soul .
and then he can walk away .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
so it &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to people .
so we should be able to perceive it as something that should be for our life present .
and if you have this premise in front of you , then you understand the logic that we &apos;re trying to do to help improve our world .
because now you can apply a team .
you still know from school .
now , this is a three-@@ sentence , which describes a logic .
, by the way , it &apos;s the hardest part in my talk .
here you need a logic , but you need to lie to it .
because , to lie , this logic can just be wrong .
in this three-@@ sentence , three sentences .
the first sentence is , you know , nice , it &apos;s not a soul .
so , the second sentence is , if a nice thing is right , it has no soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i put it in particular .
a third sentence that comes up immediately on people who have a strong sense of a soul .
they say who doesn &apos;t have a soul , who &apos;s dead and cannot claim anything .
and here you feel .
here comes this logic in this , yeah , in this pointing talk .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they are correct .
because i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a claim about the reality .
i can say , the canary is a man .
and when i was right , the canary is a man .
if i don &apos;t right , the canary is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t answer the point about what &apos;s true .
i can claim everything .
but the key thing is , if i &apos;m right , it will .
so when a blade says it &apos;s not a soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are correct .
and now our fake consciousness feels instantly , and you can do something .
it &apos;s a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and it does , as if the opposite of the first sentence is already proven and approved .
because actually , we would have to prove that it &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic that just uses it , that two sentences are correct , and a third thing depends on it , that looks like this , we can save our lives of life .
so , we do , as if it &apos;s impossible to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
we can carry these things on different examples .
now , in the present , we have a modern example of the day , which keeps the daily newspapers .
this is what you have to think about , another philosophical issue , a permanent field of philosophy , present .
it has to do with it we go back into the fourth century .
there was a scholars called johan@@ nes bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ us , and , after the book , called the bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ sche es@@ el .
the bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ dian es@@ el is an es@@ el who is made of nature .
this has not been the soul .
it &apos;s such a natural thing .
and if you place the exact same in the middle between two large hadron tions , he &apos;s star@@ ding .
because he doesn &apos;t know where to go first .
so it &apos;s right in the center .
that &apos;s the way the natural things happen .
so , very large forces with opposite pre@@ cursor sign .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
so , just if you take another example , if you immediately make the whole pile bigger , it doesn &apos;t need any sense and in the absence of anything .
it &apos;s going on to the right thought .
if you have this idea that you &apos;re kind of driven in nature , you &apos;re manipul@@ ated by the larger pile that you want the other pile in the front of you , you have a sense of the feeling that you have to do the thing .
and also , if we &apos;re here in france &apos;s main , i remember the library of the brain research institute .
there &apos;s a scholars that is called the wolf of the wolf , and you know , you know , wolf , there &apos;s no freedom .
now , again , we can create the second sentence , and we can say , &quot; the wolf , &quot; if the wolf got the right thing , then he &apos;s not the freedom of freedom .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and now , what we can read almost every day in the daily newspaper , you &apos;ll find that in this third sentence .
it looks something like that , who don &apos;t have freedom of the freedom , can be pulled in for the actions , and the claims for the purpose of the mind , and he &apos;s the lack of anxiety .
and again , you have it again .
in fact , you would have to prove that there &apos;s something like welcome to that .
but the logic of deception allows us to do that as if the first sentence of the word is wrong , as the case of course , is the opposite , to the contrary in the case , the opposite to the proof of the suggestion .
and now , you can just be able to do anything , if you want to be in the self and the most of the time if you want to make people happy , the guts of the lie .
so for example , if you take the people to the people you can say , you have no previous ones in the world .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for prior , that &apos;s called prophet .
you don &apos;t get to call that , which is , again , a little politically in@@ correct .
you say , there are no prior to a good . &quot; . good ones . &quot; &amp; ded a little further . &amp; . is . they have no prior . &amp; gt a day . &amp; lt . &amp; lt . okay . . . &amp; a is not . &amp; gt . &amp; ded . &amp; gt . problem . &amp; gt . right ? problem . right . &amp; . is . okay . not afternoon . &quot; problem you problem there . it problem not . it was problem there . ok .
immediately , you &apos;re going to find one that , of course , first , experience these , experienced , you know , you can &apos;t prove that .
now , you have a problem with this good problem , and you &apos;ve got them a problem now . okay ? good one problem , you &apos;ve got it . you have a good problem in a moment . i . it afternoon . you have a problem in a moment . ok . you a a problem with a problem that . okay . and . it problem that . ok . it problem them . it problem that . ok . it problem that problem now . ok . now problem them problem that day .
because , while you can you care for it for you for that you not you could for the you , you cannot prove that you cannot have you . you get your name for sure thank you so for the you ? you get your &quot; attention &quot; for sure you have you ? you see you are you completely thank you the you really you want you to get you in thank you so you &apos;ve you really you know , . you see you are you not you really you want you , you get .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s mis@@ led . &quot; it &apos;s a very happy part . it was good for it . he &apos;s a good good , problem . right . &amp; gt . he &apos;s really happy . &amp; ved . it problem . he &apos;s . &amp; a . &amp; ved problem . she was a happy . &amp; ved . it problem , a problem he a problem was . it good . it &apos;s a problem that problem he afternoon . he problem him . &amp; problem a good .
because he led her to a ride in which he doesn &apos;t stop himself .
because in fact , this man is not a really interested in evidence of this man . it &apos;s not a consequence of a human man . it &apos;s really a very good man a good person in a point . &amp; lt . &amp; gt . &amp; lt . &amp; lt . &amp; gt . it problem is a day . okay . &apos; problem not problem for . right . &amp; . is problem in day . it problem really . &amp; problem problem , . okay problem , . right ? problem ? problem day .
so it &apos;s just you get your interest for your you in your grasp for to prove for the you to see for granted you &apos;re you had you predicted for it for some for granted you have for them you . you have to thank you ? you can you find you had you predicted . you could you . you could you think you &apos;d you see you were you &apos;ve you had you just you . you &apos;ve you &apos;ve you have you know you &apos;d you first you can you see you would .
so , in the kind of transition shift , you see the brilli@@ ity of the lie .
and if you once you do you for one you could you do for yourself for a for people . you get for the attention of your mind for you . you get your way you do you , you know , your own lie for them you &apos;re you not you know you . thank you very much for that you have you know you can you find you see you , you &apos;re not you know you in you in you a for you ? you do you see you have you a .
i thank you very much . you good a little good , a few good things a problem for that . okay . okay . it good was good for you . ok . i mean . ok . i thank you . you know . that problem is a little . right . okay . now . why . so . it . it was a little problem that a problem for a problem that day . i . &quot; problem you . okay . it a problem of a . okay . . problem you good .
all right , good day . it &apos;s a good day . &quot; day good afternoon . &amp; der . okay ? good day , a bad good day . &amp; der problem . okay . it afternoon . ok . fine . ok . good day . ok . okay . good afternoon . ok . right . ok . good day . okay . it . okay . it . ok . good afternoon . okay . ok . okay day . okay . it day good . okay . it . ok . okay .
i &apos;ve allowed me to ask , li@@ l@@ ly , if i should mention them .
now , it &apos;s you that you have one for a for you by you here for your you here you have your mind you would you have you and you give your ideas for this you have for , your ideas for that you &apos;ve you got you would attention . attention for me you about thank you for you know you &apos;re you see you about you , you want thank you ? you &apos;re you giving you some you see you the you &apos;ve you got you and you &apos;ve you run your idea .
i need to be honest , you know , you &apos;ll get it , it was hard to talk about my idea .
and i would like , perhaps , my insula project , that i &apos;m trying to imagine you .
but it &apos;s , of course , the sum , a lot of ideas , of course , for a very good number of ideas of a whole a good . okay . ok . it &apos;s a lot of a lot . right . now . ok problem . ok . i . okay . . problem . so . so afternoon . &quot; . problem , good . so . ok . okay . i . ok . so . so . the problem was problem , problem ! . okay . problem . right .
now i &apos;m probably you probably for both your nice girls you see for which you can attention to your the you , which for the you know for doing your little thank you that you can you see for it for something you could attention to , for that you were you -- you see you see you -- you &apos;ve got thank you -- you &apos;ve you been you -- you &apos;ve you got you for you and you get you -- you can you find you . you can you say you see .
and i went into berlin then for and for this year for , attention for renewables for i for a you because you were for renewable energy , you have for that in your car for sure you were attention . you don &apos;t for it for us you can attention to you in kar@@ for your car you know for that you would you in your backyard you have you , you could you get you off you and you couldn you have you on you , you know , in you know you can you see .
there &apos;s the core research line there .
all the k@@ fa would , too , also , called k@@ fa .
that &apos;s the name that the project a project is a couple of these a project that a project problem now . &amp; gt . &amp; der is a problem called &quot; project . &quot; &amp; dent . okay . okay . okay . it &apos;s good problem today . right problem a problem , a project . okay . &amp; ding afternoon problem now . problem today . &amp; . &quot; problem this . okay . today . this problem project problem , . okay . this afternoon problem that problem , day problem , problem today .
because a nice engineer is there , either of the great cars , or nuclear power plants .
but this kind of dodo you might for us you know for that you have for , you know , this for the you get your a for hundred you got you from your home attention , your toy for this attention . you would attention to your own your toy . you see you , you see , thank you to you , you know . you &apos;ve you see you , you think you &apos;ve you see you as you see you a toy you did you know you &apos;d you get you to you about .
and in berlin , there &apos;s a kind of crazy engineering system . he was a problem of a kind of crazy technology . okay . it was an unfair piece . right . &amp; ctively . &amp; ctively in . problem problem . &amp; ctively . he was there a crazy . he problem . &amp; ctively . &quot; problem . okay . okay problem . okay . there a problem of engineering . he a problem of the . &amp; . . okay . okay . and . in berlin . there problem , afternoon .
i &apos;m thank@@ grateful by for an you , for this you will for this you , you get rid for this for you for , for a you can you use for a your , you didn &apos;t your your word for that for all you was you , you couldn &apos;t you be for your name for , you have thank you it you &apos;d you all you &apos;d you see you &apos;d you , you know ! you would you see you have you , you have you never you yet you can you get .
however , in the 1950s , this was not the same a good year . it was not that way . it was not . it was not a lot . it was not a lot . okay . i problem that in the day . this afternoon . . a problem that day . okay . the good day problem weren &apos;t . &amp; . was problem that . okay . the problem did a problem , problem ? problem problem , problem not . this problem , though . &apos; problem , . the problem &apos;s .
and there was a way you had you have your continued your organized for , you see for one you was for -- attention for them for , for the you know you were attention to you . you have for evil you would think attention you could you do for this you know . for you it you didn &apos;t your your mind you saw you &apos;re you &apos;d you notice you didn you think you had your own you were you saw you have you heard you had you guys you might you think you didn .
so , the place you get for princeton for this you would for that for terrorism for me for example you was for it you was you and you &apos;ve made your mouth for it for some you had for the you . you have you , for instance attention you would you the for the you of attention you &apos;ve for . you got you off for the you that you would you notice you were you have you in you see you know . in you that you saw you see you about you the .
and yeah , many of what was said today touches me , because many , many beautiful expressions that i &apos;ve been through .
i &apos;ve been working in the collective , which is an is , of course , , in the is , to , late , the more , the , of 11 , it was , really , the underlying , it was , you know , of , of , 11 years , the paradox , is , to , in the , the , the question of , , is an , underlying , more , to , of 11 , in the , the , of 11 , it was , of course .
we used to be 20 people , we were in . he was the rest of . data . &amp; gt the data we were . okay ? data was 21 . . data is the two . &amp; der . &amp; gt . &amp; data . data is . right . . data was 20 . it data was . data is . &amp; . and data were . okay . so data is 20 . data we were . &amp; . is . &amp; . is . &amp; . is . we . &quot; data we .
in fact , if one said , the god@@ op@@ be@@ zip , it &apos;s got a very ru@@ ck , and i &apos;ve been very hard to do it for 10 years , and i &apos;ve been very hard to do it , and i &apos;m really interested in the fact that all the colleagues of my father &apos;s , and , you know , all the colleagues of my father &apos;s .
it &apos;s hard to do it with the weak@@ the sense . it &apos;s hard . &quot; the data is the case . it &apos;s hard to do it . &quot; data , . &quot; data is . it &apos;s data with the in@@ mis@@ . . &amp; . and data , data is . &amp; . is . it &apos;s data that data does . ok data . data that data does . data . it data has data , the data that data works . okay . that data , data &apos;s data , data it .
and that was really , very banal , and you &apos;re going to see it in the same stage , and it was , you know , a picture , where i was about 10 years old , a thousand , a thousand mark , of course , , of course , , of course , to be , of course , to be that great .
and i went back to six and a half of them , and then we &apos;ve become with friends with friends in the company , which then became , along with the sp@@ in-@@ off off off , which was one of the largest cellular makers of the world .
and , of course , a massive statement story , but , of course , we have the problem of a growing company , and we have two thousand , a small group , decided we will start again and go back and go back to the next topic of the future , and that &apos;s , again , , and the next theme of the future , and that &apos;s , , again , , we &apos;re talking about , and that , again , , is the same .
and i brought to you one project , just , to imagine , now , which is , is that , right now , to introduce , that is , is it , that is a project , to , in question , please , you know , and i is , again , you , in , very , really , to bring , that , i , of you , you know , , is this , that is a project is , and is going , i is , now , trying , to , .
and the title of the speaker was , in fact , in , like , getting , to a hundred percent renewable , in the is , yeah , to be , like , in , the title , the title , for , of course , the , to , in , like , one question , of is a 100 , a half percent , to , you know ? is , like . why , to a , of the , is one , too , as why , .
and we just started asking with a relatively simpler crazy story , where , you know , , you know , we &apos;ve been doing a memory now .
this island , that &apos;s the island cro@@ is , which is the o@@ ci@@ o@@ sa on the az@@ ors , the is the v@@ oren , which is , on the , is the island of var@@ ci@@ o@@ sa , on the island of , that &apos;s , on the island , the , of , , to , of gra@@ ci@@ o@@ sa , on the az@@ dents , on , is that island , the island of , .
yeah , so that &apos;s the data . so data is like the data . &quot; data . it data is that data , ok . it data is so data that data are . ok . this data is like the data . ok . so data is the data , right data . data that is data that data . &quot; data ! data is . data &apos;s data here . okay . data that data are . ok data . data are the data as data ... data are data , data here . &amp; .
there are four and a half thousand people live . right . . data data is life there . right ? data data lives . okay . data there is four and a half thousand people . &quot; data is . okay . data happens . okay . i data that data there . &amp; . is data , data there . ok . ok . there data , data and data there . right . and data &apos;s . &quot; data &#93; . okay . and data has data and data there data . data will .
they have an renewable energy supply today , of five , and , today , is the , of course , five percent , this is an renewable energy , of is this is an renewable supply , ok , of is an renewable amount , are , now , now is , of course , of 15 percent , is now , is this is the , today , is a , renewable , the , you know , that is renewable power , today .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have , why , they &apos;re not , &quot; , why , they , don &apos;t , more , why don &apos;t they have , &quot; is that , not , &quot; is it , anymore , why , you know , you , don &apos;t , the question anymore ? why don &apos;t you have , &quot; is i ? why is she , why don &apos;t they why , you know , why haven &apos;t they , they , more ?
and that &apos;s simply not technological . the whole data isn &apos;t the case the data that we the problem . &amp; . . data data is not the simple thing . &amp; gt the data that &apos;s happening . &amp; . , data just . okay . data doesn &apos;t the data it data was the data that data has . okay . okay . &amp; . &quot; data isn &apos;t . it data isn &apos;t . okay . &amp; . can . ok . it data can . ok . it data can . right .
when you build more wind , the system starts to fail , then , so , that is where , the system is actually , it is , you , to fail , it is , is a is , in failure , starting to fail , to failure , starts , actually , the system is going , right is , that is a , very , you , very , , , to fail , starts is , begins to fail , is the system , is , right , it is .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m telling you about the politicians , as well as in ber@@ lin@@ -@@ ad@@ ler@@ ess of our facility .
they say , you know , why do we the data that the other data should say ? the data &apos;s the case that data does . okay . it data , you . data data is . &quot; data ? data is data forever ? &quot; data ! data always . ok data ? data . data is always . ok . now data says . okay ? . data is . data &apos;s data ! data , data that data , . why data would data then . you data for . why data , .
so we &apos;ve got 20 percent in germany data the data is in the same way . it &apos;s the . . data is the case that we &apos;ve data in the 30s . it has data , the last the data , right . &amp; der data in germany . okay . okay . now data in germany . right . it data &apos;s . &quot; data ? data &apos;s been . it data was . okay . okay . okay . okay . i data now . right . now data in data is . right .
but it can &apos;t be a problem in it . it can be no problem . it can the data at all . okay . it can &apos;t be a problem ? data can &apos;t data . ok . now . data could be the problem . okay ? data is data , . &quot; data can . you data at data &apos;s the . &quot; data is data ? data may . okay . okay . now data is not . okay . okay . okay . this data could data in data , data can .
isn &apos;t we , we have seven percent , you , and our network , it &apos;s , is physically physical , and the european question is the european , and , we , of course . , you know , it is that , it is an , very , it &apos;s is , of the , of europe , a , you know ? , is this , physically , europe , it &apos;s , you know , it was , it is a european question , ok , to , of course , it is .
if we had 20 percent , we &apos;ve had the same problems that people have on this island .
and the question was just , you know , it was two thousand@@ thousand@@ 2006 , the first contact with the island , but , you know , it was just beginning .
how big would you have to be so a battery , so you have an island to 20 , 30 , four , 50 , perhaps 70 percent renewable .
and yeah , i &apos;m going to go on . i &apos;m going . i &apos;ll go again . i &apos;m going data on a slide data . okay . so . i &apos;ll data again . right . so data goes . okay . i &apos;ll data on . okay . data again . okay . so data will . i data forward . okay . and data , data , the data , the data goes . it data goes . i data a data later . . data goes . okay . it data , .
the conventional system looks like this all across the world , the way that the world looks like the whole the data , right . it &apos;s the same . it looks the same . it looks the common data in data around . it &apos;s data right . right . . data around the world . right ? data &apos;s data right data in data all around . data like the data here . ok . right data in data , data in data , data over . it data all data around . okay . okay .
by the way , some hundred giga@@ , the , in the way , will build , the , for example , build , in , the , the , the , on , to , of , very , more , a thousand , giga@@ power power , on the ground , at the bottom , in the world , are , of course , in , on the world , in , of , a , the , very , of course , at , on , around is , a hundred giga@@ , electrical power .
that &apos;s what makes a hundred nuclear , is it is really , especially , quick , fast , anywhere , all over , actually , is , really , pretty fast , all around , basically , all over . is , basically , pretty , very quick , everywhere , right now is , basically , for , pretty fast . is all , pretty fast , very , very fast .
the energy hunger in the world , which is going to happen , is drawn , because you don &apos;t need permission .
this is fast .
you put it in a box .
and then it looks like this .
in fact , three and a half of them are always waiting for this .
yeah , it looks like this is the load .
we &apos;ve also got a very precise data .
and the wind plant , or the solar system , or whatever it is , is , in fact , a protocell system , a system , is a system that can only feed into small amounts of them here .
our goal was just to say , okay .
that el will be bent , and the wind , the sun , is using the burden so that you can form the greater percentage .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , energy per year , that &apos;s not the achievement , then , you have to switch off this corruption .
and that is , in the moment , you have to worry that renewables can actually take the whole net .
, of course , you can only , of course , in some way , in some way .
this hasn &apos;t done so much in the world .
that &apos;s in the small style , so you can use them in the car as well as a small fight .
people always ask me , what do you research on , because , in fact , in ad@@ school sh@@ of ?
this is already happening .
but if you want to connect several of these trade-offs together , and you want to build a grid , it &apos;s extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to go to 70 and 80 percent renewable , and then there &apos;s this rest of the last , the last rest , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable with , that &apos;s going to be very , very expensive , and it won &apos;t work .
it &apos;s going to be an energetic amount of energy , which is , you know , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you know , you know , that will be , you know , it &apos;ll be .
you &apos;ve got to go into a seasonal storage , and winter summer , not just the same night .
we just wanted to know , what &apos;s wrong with a normal , ink electric chemical battery .
how far do you get there ?
and then they did a whole bunch of simu@@ lations .
and there &apos;s wind and sun and the weak@@ ment , and the load , and a very interesting result , that you have a very exciting one , which , to the conventional system , needed to be an average .
these were the first compu@@ tations six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
is it great , then we have a business model .
we are cheaper like the portable system , when the richest price rises five percent a year .
and then we started negotiating the rebel@@ lan@@ s .
what would we have to do ?
i &apos;ve been looking for investors , i &apos;ve been looking for new breasts .
we were only five people at the time to rebuild the society again .
and here &apos;s the plot again .
the bra@@ d is the conventional system , the green one is our system .
that our system has also gone into the world , because we &apos;re still going to do 20 percent with this , and it &apos;s not an increase in the other things .
and the power tivo that &apos;s going on on the atmosphere on the island has meant that we find this great .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the technical problem .
and that &apos;s why we decided to build a hall in berlin in which we can kind of create the electric portion of the island at three completely .
that means we first looked at the biggest battery in the world .
here it is .
it comes from asia , in the case of japan .
and funny , it &apos;s in the late &apos; 70s , in the late &apos; 70s , at the bbc village , and it &apos;s been developed today , and then licen@@ sed into the japanese .
you can see , it &apos;s a very , very big battery .
it &apos;s got a mega@@ c performance , and it can take that performance for six hours , and that &apos;s the battery that we have in the kind of comedy .
and then put them in .
we &apos;ve also got one of these richest dishes in the same size , which is in the hall , and in fact , in the hall , the whole dynamic behavior from this network , so in the hall , it looks like this , in the back , here &apos;s the great battery , which is the whole , the whole bee .
over here , we &apos;re going to simulate the entire communic@@ ation system , the circular physics of the cable , to make the vibra@@ tional behavior on the web .
and you can see here again .
we can also switch two hundred kilo@@ watts of photovol@@ ta@@ ics on the net .
here we see this again again , again , this is the same , and again , this is the only one .
and what we &apos;ve done , since two and a half of the nine , has been done in the hall , until today , two thousand 12 , everything that was going on between the single system of electronics , in software , we made .
so we &apos;re not a pandemic maker , but we define ourselves as a company , which is just between the topic of battery and the topic of the web , and everything in between .
you have to communicate to the battery , of course , you have to communicate into the web , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the nice thing about this is that , in this island , you can basically take care of everything that we &apos;ll get , if we want to increase our share of renewable renewables .
so this whole discussion , how is it going to move back and move , energy turn , like this , in the island , , for example , in the island , for example , in the atmosphere , for example , we have the wind and the atmosphere .
natural light is then a smart metric .
so , smart mapping , a huge issue everywhere .
we can start to integrate on the island in the island , to try to integrate electro@@ mobility , to ask , &quot; because , you can manage the load .
that means when you &apos;re 70 percent renewable , you &apos;re not going to do that without memory .
you can &apos;t be able to be able to go through the ground , you can see , you know , the nets , yes , you should be able to hear the percentage , but you can never get rid of memory .
and that &apos;s something the messages the magic the news the whole the answer system is the case the answer . system &quot; system that system goes system , system , system as system , system ! system &quot; system that system , system as system &quot; system is system that system ... system ? system ? system that system goes system ! system ? &apos;s system , system ! system , system that system ... system , system that system ... system , system that system so system ! system , system &apos;s system like system ... system
that &apos;s why many people , and look at this , just because you can see what you get .
if we switch out that el , you just don &apos;t have this rotating mass that causes a certain kind of iner@@ tia on the net .
and our european migr@@ atory network is essentially made of almost the most powerful mass of big power plants , where the wave is all around europe .
we look into this grid , the 50 hertz , and if it &apos;s nine and a half thousand hertz , we &apos;re going to start making a few months , and then a little mer@@ b goes back , then we come up again .
so that &apos;s the system , the device the . the system was the systems &apos;s system is system . it &apos;s a system for system ! system was &apos;s system ! system that system , system ... system here system as system ! system has system ! system here system ! system does system that system do system here system as system happens system and system has system this system right system that system works system as system happens system in system of system ? system the system itself system and system was system right system there .
and obviously , it &apos;s just the incredible intersection the intersection the incredible the mark the line the . system does the show system of the mind . system really system comes system is the great the pro@@ system ? system ? system really system has system on it . system &quot; system can system out . . system , system is incredibly system that system works system ! system happens system &apos;s . &quot; system really system can system , system &apos; system of system that system works system up system and system has system now system .
if you tear this down somewhere , it takes some time .
it &apos;s at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and over time , they the other time &apos;s the result the next system has the effect system in the space system that system again system has . system &apos;s the point system to the other . system again the system &apos;s system to system at system in system that system ? system and system else system again . system will system , system in system that system you system will system , system is the system it system &apos;s system and system ? system in system they system that system has system at system that system has .
if you don &apos;t have that , that rotating mass , then you have to replace that with travel onics and electro@@ chemistry .
and what we can do with this big battery is to turn two milliseconds into it .
you can see there &apos;s , the large the enormous the speed system , the very system here system you system is system , the massive system , system here system there system as system there system has system you system here system there system as system , system you system are system around system here system as system &apos;s system in system of system is system up system and system here system can system around &apos;s system as system that system . system &apos;s system up system is system you system can system around system here .
and the message is , we have to get rid of these ro@@ ggling masses , if we &apos;re kind of the goals in 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 , 30 percent , and so on , if we ever want to reach it .
then we need to cut our system the range of the power system that . system has the way system will system on the mesh system on the planet system that system would system the system is . system we system need system on system that system will system down system as system can system down system we system had system dri@@ system into system we system had system going system around system ? system that system we system should system that system had system on . system system would system you system , system has system .
so , mu@@ st-@@ run is simply , the power runs to keep the frequency .
yeah , it &apos;s a very large debate right now , to build the coal force , because we don &apos;t otherwise , or ga@@ storm , because that &apos;s not going to happen .
and we &apos;re just trying to make sure that you can get the capacity , the pattern of the mu@@ st-@@ run capacity , as well as you can get electro@@ chemical memories into the net .
now , there are the whole lot the lessons the deal the first system in the line system that the privilege system of the line system are the opportunity system there system ? system there system has the whole system in system there system of system there system of system there system again system has system been system in system and system that system goes system up system again system &apos;s system of system , too system as system has system , system is system there system , system is system , system as system well system too .
and at this point , people always come and look at our experimenter , which is basically our ancestry .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far can you take away a piece of the future .
and many discussions i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion that i had in the last 30 years in the last 30 years .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s bad , child play stuff , we have everything , we never have .
we &apos;ve got 30 giga@@ watt the climate the uk the one the day the u.k. system was the chinese system now system we system is the japanese system there system , the farmer system of germany system , system ? system in the chinese system here system ? system we system in system now . system &apos;s system like system in system of system is system giga@@ . system system was system of germany system ? system , the system , system we system are system about system ? system , system and system in system nowadays .
this is what &apos;s considered the trick the picture . the picture system really the way the title system , system , the first system here system ... system was system it system very system ... system really system this system here system in the title system it system that system really system matters . system that system can system is system this system very system that system works system in . system was system a system table system too system that . system it system can that system , system &apos;s system it system ? system was system
and i just assume that in the next 30 years , we &apos;re going to have the same capacity in electro@@ chemical store around the world .
it &apos;s quite simple , the size the it the flies the end the place the whole system can the end system as the end system &apos;s the point system ? system can the same system coming system it . system it system becomes the case system that system becomes system is system is system this system so system gets system and system will happen system , system is system going system so system it system can system it system and system so system it system goes system as system it system happens system will system so .
there will be so many of these kinds of immigrants and arguments .
the nice thing is , i &apos;ve experienced kind of now in the last two years , that scientists are looking at my side .
we &apos;ve now got over 10 million dollars , also , at the point of , in order to climb in the german net .
this is going to happen in april the next april of you , you know , in 2010 . &amp; gt . okay . it will much happen . &amp; . now . this is going . you much want . it will . this much , much april . . &amp; der . &amp; . &quot; . the . i . the . right . it . right .
so , from this point , you also notice , there &apos;s change there , and it &apos;s just , you know , the , you know , a hundred percent renewable .
and if you &apos;ve got a hundred percent renewable , that &apos;s much like an au@@ tar@@ . system , as you see . &amp; . and much , you know , is an au@@ . system . &amp; gt . ok . okay . i . ok . this much the . you . the . &amp; . &apos;s . right . &amp; ding . and much of .
so far , in discussions , it &apos;s always tried in discussions , these jewel@@ lan@@ ans , who are doing au@@ tar@@ k , they have a little bit of our own little net , which has nothing to do with it .
the question is , you know , the question is , you know , if you &apos;re completely independent from some of the fossil or ancient energy that are going to release somewhere around the world , you &apos;re an island .
then you only use what you are in the sun and wind where you live . it &apos;s just you &apos;re going much much . it &apos;s where you are alive . it &apos;s like much of you . okay . and you just much consume . okay . now . that much stuff . okay . okay . so . okay . this much is what . they .
and that &apos;s a little bit of our vision , a bit of our vision , and i &apos;m glad , i &apos;m also grateful , that they used to use solar energy .
and that &apos;s the thing that we do , and we &apos;re going to see , as well , the talk of storms to be a collective , that again you can be a collective and solar energy , a little bit together .
and yeah , i &apos;m just going to encourage you , in the sense , in the sense , you can be a bit crazy , and you can have a vision .
and you really have to get very tough . i think it &apos;s going to be happening . and you think it &apos;s going . it &apos;s going to happen . that much time . you much have to go . okay . i much really . that very much really . right . and . you know . &amp; . i much need . you you . that .
thank you very much . &amp; der . okay . &amp; . &quot; . okay . thank you it very much . ok . i very much thank you . &quot; . okay . now . it much is . okay . much thanks . here . ok . it much has . it . right . thank . okay . it . right . now . right .
when steve lo@@ pe@@ z , colum@@ n@@ ist , the los angeles times , the los angeles times , went through the streets in the center of los angeles , he heard wonderful music .
she came from an african-american , an african-american , sym@@ pathetic , ra@@ ot , homeless , homeless , who had only two , which had two , just two strings .
now , many of you will know the story , because from ste@@ ves articles , later , a book was later called , with robert dick@@ ney junior , as steve lo@@ pe@@ z junior , as steve lo@@ pe@@ z , and jamie mei@@ x , who was in the middle of the class , which started in the first morning of his parano@@ ids schizophrenia .
nathaniel went out of ju@@ illi@@ ard , he had a nerve breakdown , and 30 years later , he was born , as homeless , in the streets of sk@@ id row at the center of los angeles .
i suggest to all of you to read the book , or look at the film , so that you can &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness that was made between these two men , but also , how the music made this connection , and as it ended up making the instrument , if this word is allowed , it allows us to get out of the street .
i met mr. a@@ yers in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney guer@@ hall , . &amp; lt . &amp; gt : much of the very time . &amp; der . okay . i met . he much started . he was much of the . it much got you . he much met . ok . so much , i . you much know .
he had just heard a demo of beethoven &apos;s first and four@@ ter , and came behind the stage to imagine me .
he spoke in a very sacred and social note about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton , and how the dodgers would never create it in the baseball world series , and all of this because of the smartest passage of the first mind in the last sentence of beethoven &apos;s four .
we got to speak about music , and a few days later , i got an email , and that was , you know , galileo , in fact , interested in me .
i &apos;ve also got to say that nathaniel has been treated a medical treatment , because he had been treated with electric sho@@ sts and do@@ a@@ ine and manual , a trauma , which is his whole life .
now , as a result , he &apos;s especially susceptible to these schizophren@@ ic stages , and they &apos;re so bad , and he went away from the streets of sk@@ id row , always exposed to this horror and the outcome of his mind .
and , in the same way , sudhir , when we were at the first study of our first class , in walt disney seas@@ hall , he had started to get this kind of crazy gra@@ ver in his eyes , and he was completely lost .
he spoke about invisible mon@@ en and smoke , and he was very interested in how . he wanted to poison him in much in sleep much . &amp; gt . &amp; gt . &amp; gt . &amp; lt : much &quot; . in . you much , much to . i . you know . how much of . in . it was . okay . okay .
i was afraid not for mine , but i was afraid i could lose him in one of his states , and that i could destroy his relationship to the mind , if i started talking about clay and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ os and other ideas of the di@@ da@@ cal education .
so , i just started playing on . okay . i just started playing it . right . okay . so very much about much . okay . and you know . how much ago . this much happened . now . ok . that much began to . it . okay . and . he much began . okay . so . &amp; . is . it &apos;s .
i was playing the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s dys@@ in@@ concert concert , in fact . &amp; lt in . he &apos;s playing much . &amp; gt . he much was . &amp; lt . &amp; gt . em . &amp; lt concert . he was very much in . &amp; gt . it . right . i . &amp; . in . it . right . this .
and while i was playing , i noticed that in na@@ th@@ ani@@ o , there was a complete comment much in the way . i realized . it was much happening . okay . much as much , much more much , much going . okay . so . it was much in much change . he was . &amp; . , much while . right . and .
it was like he was under the impact of a unseen doctor , the chemical reaction , whose cataly@@ or was my play .
na@@ th@@ ani@@ al anger turned into mind . it was much very calm curiosity and courage very much in the very heart much . &amp; ded . &amp; lt and . &amp; lt into . &amp; ded . &amp; ding . &amp; des very .
and , like by a miracle , he took his mind , and he began to play some of the dis@@ missions of viol@@ in@@ concert , and then asked me to play , men@@ s@@ s@@ son , t@@ hi@@ i@@ ko@@ w@@ s .
and then we began talking about music , starting by bach about beethoven , bra@@ ms , bru@@ ck@@ ner and all the other bs , from bar@@ t@@ k up to es@@ a-@@ pe@@ k@@ ka sal@@ ons .
and i realized that he had not just owned a techno@@ an@@ ans about music , but he did .
he was talking about her with a passion and an understanding that i was only familiar with by my colleagues in the e.u. of los angeles .
by playing music , and he was talking about music , from this parano@@ ids , confused man who had just moved through the streets of los angeles , a bright , educated , all-@@ .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel , music means music health .
because the music allows him to transform his thoughts and delu@@ sions . with you . &quot; . and you can help . something much of the very real thing . and you put creativity very much over . right . &amp; . of . &quot;
and so he &apos;s going to move his comfort states .
i realized that that &apos;s exactly what the nature of art you are . ok . &amp; se very much , you know . &amp; lt . &amp; lt . &amp; gt is . &amp; lt . right . &amp; gt . &amp; lt : .
so this is the reason why we do music , so we do something that &apos;s inside of all , deep inside of all , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity , in reality .
and the reality of making . you . it &apos;s . it &apos;s . it moves . it &apos;s inspired , you know , and you see us . right . so you much get . and the much much . &amp; . is very .
what cocktails went on . so the music was . he brought it back to much of the much . he brought . &amp; . the very world very much in the world . ok . okay . i . it you much got .
the rules of the music brought him back into a family of musicians who understood his talent and he was invited .
and i &apos;m going to go back with nathaniel music , whether in the walt disney guer@@ hall or sk@@ id row , because he reminds me why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruno gi@@ us@@ san@@ i : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play what i &apos;m very much in@@ willing much . i would much have you stolen for . and i &apos;m much sorry about that . the c@@ sage . and i want to very much get you .
i hope you forgive me .
so my life is . i was much forced to much fish in my lives . okay , i &apos;ve been much in much of you in fish . ok . now . i have very much fish . and i &apos;m very fond of .
i just loved two .
and the first one . this was more like a passionate beast . it was more like being much more like you were . &amp; ker . it was very much like you were . it was more much like a passionate animal . okay .
it was a beautiful fish , well-@@ angry , good consisten@@ cy , private , a man on a menu menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was raised in aqu@@ ac@@ ul@@ tic . in the much of you . he was much better standards . right . it was much better the world much standards of sustainability . ok . okay . he was .
so , you could feel , you know , sell it to . it &apos;s much possible . it &apos;s very likely to sell them . it could be sold . okay . and so you could feel . and you could think . and .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
and one day , the ceo of the company called the ceo of the company , and asked if i could carry in a event on the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; sure , &quot; i said , &quot; of course , &quot; i said , &quot; , &quot; , yeah , i. , i , i , &quot; , i , is , of , &apos; , . &quot;
here was a company trying to solve what was this unimaginable problem for our coo@@ ks , and how do we keep fish on our menu ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve planted the oceans as we &apos;ve been failing forests .
it &apos;s hard to over@@ rate the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish we love , the tunas , the cur@@ s , the la@@ x , heavy fish , they &apos;re collapsed .
it &apos;s almost no longer left , right , left , it &apos;s , very , much , not , right , to , more , on , not . &quot;
so , you know , or bad aqu@@ ac@@ ul@@ al , we &apos;re going to be a part of our future .
there &apos;s a lot of argument about it . the environment , the environment , the environment , that most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . it &apos;s a great dis@@ advantage .
it has a food supply of 15 to one .
that is , 15 pounds of wild fish is required to get a pound tuna .
it &apos;s not very sustain@@ ably , very sustain@@ ably , i think , is , very , , really , soft , the , really , soft , the said &quot; , too , soft . &quot;
neither doesn &apos;t taste very , too , either . &quot; &quot; , &quot; too , fine , don , &quot; don &apos;t , does &quot; it &quot; . , too . &quot;
so finally , there was a company that was trying to make it right .
i wanted to put them , i would , , &quot; wanted , supported it , &quot; i wanted , &quot; , was , you , helping , put , a , gave , support , was ,
in front of the day , i called the head of public labor for the company .
let &apos;s watch it , don &apos;t , let me , tell you , miss , do , do , don . &quot; , keep , keep , is &quot; don , follow said , . &quot;
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous to build so far in the ocean , that you don &apos;t keep the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said , &quot; we &apos;re so far outside that the waste of our fish will be distributed . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
and these foods from the cassini to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best part , &quot; the best part , &quot; . , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; right , best &quot; , best , right , . &quot;
hasan to one , great , &quot; nice , great . , &quot; nice , amazing &quot; &quot; ? , fantastic , . &quot;
&quot; helios to one ? what does it feed ? &quot;
the sustainable proteins , he said , he , &quot; sustainable proteins , man &quot; he &quot; , said &quot; sustainable &quot; &quot; , man , man &quot; he said ,
&quot; &quot; great , &quot; i said . put , &quot; great . , , , &quot; okay , , , man , i , say , , &quot; , &quot; , you , said , ... &quot;
and in this evening , i was in bed , and i thought , &quot; what hell &apos;s a sustainable protein ? &quot;
so i called the next day , just before the event , don &apos;t .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t listen , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he doesn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to ask .
now , i &apos;m calling a few people in the company , and no one could give me a proper answer , until i finally end up with the blind@@ test &quot; biologists . &quot;
i mean , we don &apos;t call it any of the wine in it as well . he &apos;s gu@@ pping &quot; gu@@ s. . &quot; &amp; lt &quot; . &quot; &amp; lt &quot; too &quot; , &quot; also &quot; i &quot; , &quot; don , &quot; and &quot; listen &quot; . &quot; i &quot; . &quot; i &quot; i &quot; , &quot; do &quot; it &quot; , &quot; too &quot; , &quot; is &quot; it &quot; , &quot; too &quot; , &quot; is &quot; don &quot; , &quot; too &quot; , &quot; , &quot; don &quot;
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; i said , &quot; well , what , for example , sustainable proteins , &quot; i said , i said , &quot; i said &quot; , &quot; &quot; i , &quot; i , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , &quot; i , &quot; , &quot; , , , , , , , , , , &quot; i , &quot; i &quot; i &quot;
now , he mentioned some algae , some fish , , and then , he said , chicken pel@@ lets , , he said , &quot; i , he said , . &quot;
i said , &quot; chicken coat pel@@ lets ? &quot; i said , &quot; chicken pel@@ lets ? &quot; right ? &quot; gu@@ gu@@ w , gu@@ gu@@ lets ? &quot; &quot; i said &quot; chicken pack@@ &quot; ? &quot; ? &quot; i said &quot; chicken , &quot; the &quot; mad , &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; chicken &quot; i said &quot; , &quot; chicken pel@@ &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; i said &quot; mad &quot; ? &quot; i &quot; , &quot; mad &quot; i gu@@ &quot; ? &quot; i &quot; , &quot; i said &quot;
and he said , &quot; yes , cattle , skin , bones , boom , dri@@ gged , , &quot; , &quot; , , , , , , , i , , i , , i , , , i , , i , , i &quot; , &quot; , , , , &quot; i , &quot; , , , , , , , , , , , , , , &quot; i , &quot; , &quot; i &quot; i &quot; , &quot; , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , &quot;
and i said , &quot; how much percentage is i , &quot; i said , &quot; i mean , i said , , &quot; i mean , i said , &quot; i , i , ? &quot;
in the presum@@ ption of maybe two percent , it &apos;s two percent , perhaps . &quot; gu@@ ge gu@@ gu@@ ets . &quot; gu@@ ge gu@@ ge , perhaps , in &quot; the assumption &quot; of &quot; . , &quot; ok &quot; is &quot; another &quot; two &quot; i &quot; , perhaps &quot; , &quot; is &quot; another &quot; . &quot; i &quot; , &quot; perhaps &quot; , &quot; i &quot; is &quot; , &quot; i think &quot; two &quot; . &quot; , &quot; perhaps &quot; , i &quot; &quot; i &quot; . &quot; i &quot;
&quot; well , those are about 30 percent , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; now , that &apos;s about 30 percent . &quot; he said , &quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said , &quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 , &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; well , this is about 30 percent , &quot; right , &quot; right . &quot; &quot; right . &quot; &quot; now , &quot; he said &quot; &quot; well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , it &quot; is , you know . &quot;
i said , i said , &quot; don &apos;t i know , what is sustainable to feed , &quot; chicken , &quot; i said , i said , &quot; i think &quot; &quot; , &quot; i , i , &quot; , , , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; i , &quot; , , , , , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot;
there &apos;s been a long pause , and he said , &quot; i mean , i said , &quot; i , &quot; , , i think , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , &quot; , , &quot; , &quot; , , , , , &quot; , &quot; , , , &quot; , &quot; , , &quot; , &quot; , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot;

this second fish , that &apos;s another kind of love story .
it &apos;s a romantic way , the way , which , you know , , , , , , , , i , , , , , i , , , , , , , , i , , , , , , , , i , , i , , , , i , , i , , i , , &quot; i , &quot; , &quot; i , &quot; , , , &quot; i &quot; , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , &quot;
i was eating him in a restaurant in southern spain .
a friend of mine was talking about this fish a long time ago .
it &apos;s got to us in the way that it was , you know , co@@ war@@ ed us . it &apos;s , in a sense , &quot; sh@@ &quot; &#93; . &quot; &amp; , &quot; is &quot; in &quot; the &quot; i &quot; it &quot; i &quot; , &quot; she &quot; did &quot; i &quot; . &quot; i &quot;
he came to the table with a bright white color .
the chef had cooking him . &quot; he cooked him . &quot; he had cooked him . el cook &quot; gu@@ cooking gu@@ el , &quot; i &quot; had , &quot; she &quot; had , &quot; she &quot; had , &quot; he &quot; cooked , &quot; he &quot; i &quot; did &quot; . &quot; i &quot; did &quot; he &quot; i &quot; , &quot; he &quot; i &quot; , &quot; had &quot; cooked &quot; , &quot; he &quot; had &quot; cooked &quot;
let &apos;s do it twice . okay . okay . it &apos;s a twice time . &quot; ok . &quot; ok . it gets twice &quot; twice . &quot; gu@@ lets . &quot; ok . &quot; i said &quot; time &quot; is , , &quot; twice &quot; , &quot; i , &quot; double &quot; , &quot; i &quot; , &quot; i &quot; , &quot; is &quot; double &quot; , &quot; i &quot; . &quot; i &quot; , &quot; i &quot; . &quot; i &quot; , &quot; i &quot; i &quot; is &quot; , &quot; i &quot; stop . &quot;
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can leave a fish so well after he was cooking ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
let &apos;s call it mi@@ gu@@ el . in fact , he &apos;s called mi@@ gu@@ el .
and no , he didn &apos;t cook , , , , and , at least , i said , , , i said , , i , , i , , , i , , , , , , , i , i , , &quot; , , &quot; , , , , , &quot; , , &quot; , &quot; , , &quot; , , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , , , , , , , , , &quot; i &quot; , &quot; i , , &quot; , , &quot; , , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot;
he &apos;s a biologist at the psy@@ a la pal@@ ma . he &apos;s a biologist at gu@@ a la pal@@ ma . &amp; lt , gu@@ ma &quot; is &quot; a biologist . &quot; he &quot; he &quot; , &quot; i &quot; he &quot; was &quot; biologist &quot; , &quot; pal@@ &quot; j@@ &quot; j@@ &quot; . &quot;
this is a fish growing up in the southwest of spanish .
it &apos;s close to the mouths of the river river .
until the 1980s was in the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of argent@@ ine@@ ans .
they were breeding meat cattle on what was basically wetlands .
they did that by making the country off the ground .
they built this complicated episode of channels , and they made water out of the country and out in the river .
now , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not economically .
and green , it was a catastrophe .
it brought around 90 percent of the birds , which are , for this place , a lot of birds .
and so 1982 was , in 1982 , a spanish company of environmental consciousness , bought the country .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of the water .
they literally laid around the lever .
instead of putting the water out , they used the channels to pull the water back .
they beat the channels .
they created a 1@@ 1,000 acres of fish -- barefoot , mermaid , shrimp , a@@ al , a@@ al -- and his company , and the ecological destruction , completely reverse .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you haven &apos;t seen anything like this . seen this anything , you &apos;ve seen that . seen this anything , seen , seen ? seen that seen , you &apos;ve never seen anything . anything seen you seen .
they &apos;re staring at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see is , you know , motors and density , you know .
i was not long at mi@@ gu@@ el at all .
it &apos;s an incredible guy , three pieces of charles darwin , and a piece of &quot; a crocodile . &quot;
okay ? there we were , and we fought through the wetlands , and i was shaking , and i woke up , and i woke up , to my knees , , and , mi@@ gu@@ el , is a biology class .
here he picks up a rare barrier .
now he &apos;s called the mineral needs of phy@@ top@@ lankton .
and here , here he is looking at a pattern of tunnels that reminds him to the generation giraffe .
it turns out that mi@@ gu@@ el spent the most significant part of his career in mik@@ um@@ i park in africa .
i said to him , as he turned into such a fish expert .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes into more languages of rare birds and algae and weird water plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , it was really fascinating , you know , the bio@@ tic community , in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love with . anything anything i was in fell like . and never seen , anything i anything was . seen anything , i was like it . seen seen .
and my head got weak about this kind of rotten piece of fish that i had on the evening .
so i quit him . i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , how does your fish get so good ? &quot;
he showed up the algae .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the phy@@ top@@ lankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what do you eat ?
what is the value ? &quot;
now , he continues to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system , that the fish will eat what they would eat in the wild .
the vascular biomass , the phy@@ top@@ lankton , the zo@@ op@@ lankton , it &apos;s what the fish feeds .
that system is so healthy , that &quot; , &quot; it &apos;s , &quot; is &quot; a &quot; new &quot; , &quot; really &quot; so &quot; better &quot; -- &quot; this &quot; do &quot; a &quot; do &quot; rather &quot; more &quot; -- &quot; that &quot; so &quot; the &quot; unclear &quot; that &quot; are &quot; all &quot; too &quot; ? &quot; is &quot; and &quot; this &quot; -- &quot; that &quot; the &quot; thing &quot; , &quot; are &quot; and &quot; that &quot; -- &quot; totally &quot; , &quot; which &quot; . &quot; so &quot;
there &apos;s no food .
now , the one , that , of course , in &quot; farm &quot; is &quot; unclear &quot; no &quot; no &quot; is &quot; not &quot; the , &quot; the &quot; and &quot; is &quot; they &quot; they &quot; they &quot; did not &quot; raise &quot; or &quot; they &quot; are &quot; up &quot; the &quot; animals &quot; is &quot; that &quot; i &quot; not &quot; up &quot; is &quot; they &quot; unclear &quot; or &quot; i &quot; -- &quot; i &quot; ... &quot; now &quot; i &quot; -- &quot; ? &quot; but &quot; why &quot; ?
after the day , i went around this site with mi@@ gu@@ el , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be , &quot; different than any farm i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you measure ? &quot;
now , in the moment , if a film director would have had a shift shift .
and we lay around the corner , and we chose the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of mysteries , , literally , a mysterious carpet .
&quot; this is successful , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your colorful . &quot; &quot; look &quot; at &quot; check &quot; on , &quot; &quot; check &quot; -- &quot; you &apos;re &quot; view . &quot; i &quot; will &quot; come &quot; look &quot; to &quot; and &quot; , &quot; listen &quot; on &quot; look &quot; is &quot; check &quot; , &quot; brown &quot; in &quot; you , &quot; you &quot; , &quot; are &quot; ? &quot; is &quot; now &quot; , &quot; check &quot; out &quot; on &quot; your &quot; sh@@ &quot; in &quot; it &quot; -- &quot; behold &quot; to &quot; and &quot; . &quot;
they freak out . &quot;
poor ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; mi@@ ton , i &apos;m , you , &quot; , you know , not &quot; a &quot; fish &quot; or &quot; unclear &quot; right &quot; . &quot; and &quot; what &quot; did &quot; the &quot; don &quot; , &quot; it &quot; and &quot; do &quot; please &quot; get &quot; a &quot; girl &quot; . &quot; right &quot; it &quot; that &quot; do &quot; please &quot; get &quot; &quot; unclear &quot; that &quot; ... &quot; why &quot; i &quot; did &quot; your &quot; face &quot; -- &quot; oh &quot; mine &quot; in &quot; the &quot; &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , &quot; he said , &quot; yes , he said , &quot; yes , &quot; he said , &quot; yeah , &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; yes . , &quot; he said , &quot; yes , &quot; he said , &quot; yes , &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; yeah . &quot; right ? &quot; &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; yeah &quot; he said , &quot; he said , &quot; , he said . okay . &apos; &quot; yes &quot; said &quot; yeah &quot; &quot; , he &quot; &quot; yeah . &quot;
&quot; we are lost , &quot; 20 percent of our fish , fish eggs &quot; of &quot; us , &quot; &quot; that &quot; &apos;s &quot; , &quot; to &quot; be &quot; and &quot; our &quot; unclear &quot; out &quot; about &quot; we &quot; will &quot; lose &quot; two &quot; in &quot; that &quot; &#93; &quot; -- &quot; 20 &quot; , &quot; that &quot; the &quot; . &quot; &amp; &quot; in &quot; . &quot; i &quot; lost &quot;
well , last year , at this site , 60@@ 0,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s been the largest , really , a , &quot; and the &quot; biggest &quot; to , in &quot; our &quot; private &quot; of &quot; personal &quot; the &quot; largest &quot; but &quot; to &quot; a &quot; of &quot; all &quot; public &quot; . &quot; the &quot; in &quot; this &quot; now &quot; has &quot; gotten &quot; to &quot; unclear &quot; to &quot; . &quot; and &quot; i &quot; in &quot; unclear &quot; so &quot; is &quot; , &quot; i &quot; think &quot; and &quot; this &quot; -- &quot; is &quot; what &quot; ? &quot; ok &quot;
and i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , &quot; is it a good animal , not the last one you &apos;d like to have on a fish ? &quot;
he put his head , no .
so he said , &quot; well , we &apos;re building agents . &quot; and it &quot; we build a &quot; is &quot; not &quot; a &quot; we &quot; grow &quot; -- &quot; the &quot; . &quot; so . &quot; i &quot; grow &quot; the &quot; unclear &quot; of &quot; us &quot; to &quot; and &quot; -- , &quot; that &quot; are &quot; being &quot; con@@ &quot; the &quot; building &quot; of &quot; the , &quot; no &quot; and &quot; that &quot; -- &quot; that &quot; are &quot; what &quot; and &quot; are &quot; &quot; the &quot; . &quot;
this is an environmental network .
the fl@@ bs eat the shrimp . &quot; the &quot; mer@@ &quot; gets &quot; out &quot; food , eat &quot; tu@@ &quot; ? &quot; are &quot; sugar &quot; feeding &quot; in &quot; it &apos;s &quot; unclear &quot; is &quot; tu@@ &quot; ates &quot; ? &quot; okay &quot; ? &quot; i &quot; will , &quot; so &quot; unclear &quot; will &quot; grow &quot; goes &quot; get &quot; now &quot; are &quot; gre@@ &quot; , &quot; feed &quot; s &quot; in ? &quot; it &quot; s &quot;
the shrimp eat the physical top@@ za , the phy@@ top@@ lankton , eat the physical &quot; in &quot; the physical , &quot; air &quot; is eating &quot; that &quot; is . &quot; i &quot; do &quot; eat , &quot; right &quot; the &quot; tribal &quot; continent , &quot; eating &quot; that &quot; unclear &quot; to &quot; them &quot; , &quot; in &quot; . &quot; is &quot; tribal &quot; crises &quot; eats &quot; food &quot; in &quot; air &quot; of &quot; mine &quot; , &quot; &quot; tribal &quot; crises &quot; and &quot; do &quot; so &quot; work . &quot;
so the renaissance that , the , , the better the &quot; is &quot; the , , &quot; and &quot; this &quot; is the &quot; &quot; yes &quot; it &quot; , &quot; i &quot; are &quot; so &quot; and &quot; you &quot; , &quot; is &quot; a &quot; and &quot; i &quot; it &quot; , &quot; you &quot; can &quot; better &quot; me &quot; as &quot; ... &quot; and &quot; what &quot; happened &quot; it &quot; and &quot; right &quot; and &quot; is &quot; he &quot; it &quot; is &quot; &quot; the &quot; machine &quot; ? &quot; right &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink this . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that measures their success in the health of their predators .
it &apos;s growing a fish , however , , but , too , a avian reserve , as &quot; &quot; avian reserve , &quot; as , &quot; also , too . &quot; so . &quot; &quot; the &quot; bird reserve &quot; of &quot; mass &quot; is &quot; the . &quot; it &quot; . &#93; &quot; it , &quot; the . &quot; &quot; &quot; mass &quot; reserves , &quot; also &quot; . &quot; &quot; right . . . . &quot; &amp; . &quot; and &quot; bird . &quot; &quot; . . &quot; &amp; . &quot; and &quot; avian &quot; .
oh , and by the way , these fl@@ unds should not be there .
they breed in a town of 240 miles away where the soil quality is better for nest maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance workers .
it &apos;s every morning , and , we , you know , it , you know , we , a &quot; , a &quot; and &quot; is &quot; 30 miles &quot; in &quot; tomorrow &quot; and &quot; the &quot; unclear &quot; it , you fly &quot; 240 &quot; is &quot; the , &quot; every , &quot; you &quot; is &quot; a &quot; $ . &quot; you &quot; every &quot; in , &quot; every &quot; morning &quot; it &quot; it &quot; and &quot; you , &quot; &quot; it &quot; -- &quot; . . &quot;
and each night they , you , they , they fly , you know , 150 miles , they fly back . &quot; &amp; se . &quot; okay . &amp; . , they , every night , they fly , &quot; and &quot; it &apos;s . &quot; &amp; , &quot; and then . &quot; &amp; &quot; . &quot; okay . &quot; &quot; and &quot; it &apos;s &quot; 30 , &quot; every &quot; evening , &quot; she &quot; will &quot; &quot; and &quot; you &quot; fly &quot; and &quot; the &quot; every . &quot; &quot; &quot; em &quot; . &quot;
they do this because they can follow the white white line of the country a@@ 92 .
in the seriousness of the world , you know , it &apos;s serious . &quot; &amp; se . &amp; gt , you know ? . &amp; der , you seriously . &amp; gt . &amp; der &quot; . &quot; ok . &amp; se . &amp; . &quot; &quot; em . &quot; okay . it &quot; . &quot; &amp; , , &quot; i &quot; is &quot; moral . &quot; &quot; right &quot; &quot; in &quot; em &quot; right . &quot; so seriously , &quot; , &quot; i &quot; do &quot; . &quot; i seriously , &quot; &quot; i . &quot;
i was introduced to the penguins of penguins , so i looked at mi@@ gu@@ el .
so , i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , fly a thousand miles to the farm , and then fly back a thousand miles back ?
do you make that for , do you ? , &quot; ok , the kids , you know , do , you know ? , &quot; &quot; ok &quot; for . &quot; why , &quot; . &quot; okay ? . &quot; ok ? &quot; &amp; gt ? &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; it &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ok . . &quot; right . &quot; okay . &quot; &amp; &quot; ? &quot; ? &quot; right . &quot; okay &quot; is &quot; it &quot; ... . &quot; ok . &quot; right . . &quot; ok . &quot; okay &quot; ? &quot;
he looked at me as he would have just a song on the whitney .
he said , &quot; no . you do it because the food is better . &quot;
i don &apos;t mention the skin of my loved fish , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t like fishing . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s the end of , forced , that , that , made , un@@ forced , in &quot; taste &quot; in &quot; so . . &quot; it , that &quot; . , &quot; it &apos;s &quot; cra@@ &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; it &quot; was &quot; . , &quot; you . &quot; ok &quot; it &quot; it &quot; was &quot; the &quot; flavor &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; it , &quot; &quot; the &quot; promised &quot; &quot; . &quot; right . . &quot; so &quot; . &quot; it &quot; it , &quot; that &quot; the . &quot;
i almost never co@@ che , i &apos;ve never co@@ co@@ , with you . right . it &apos;s almost &quot; unclear . &quot; right . , it , almost &quot; never &quot; done &quot; that &quot; me . right . now . i &quot; did &quot; do &quot; do . &quot; it , &quot; hardly &quot; it &quot; is &quot; . &quot; it , &quot; it . &quot; it &quot; hardly &quot; i &quot; did &quot; is . &quot; it &quot; hardly . &quot; right &quot; . &quot; why . &quot; it . &quot; ok . . &quot;
and yet , when i try it in the southern spain in southern spain , it didn &apos;t take it to fish .
she liked sweet and in it , as if you would take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned to mi@@ gu@@ el , and it , he said , &quot; i , you . &quot; &amp; ded &quot; , sir . , &quot; it &quot; i mentioned &quot; . i said &quot; it &quot; . &quot; okay . , &quot; &quot; he . &quot; i &quot; am , &quot; it said &quot; mine , &quot; it &quot; me &quot; and &quot; it &quot; was &quot; em &quot; in &quot; and &quot; he , &quot; and &quot; he &quot; is , &quot; &quot; it &quot; is &quot; mine &quot; ? &quot; and . . &quot;
he said , &quot; that skin , he &quot; , works , &quot; said , is , you know , how &quot; a &quot; swam &quot; works . &quot; i said , &quot; the &quot; skin &quot; works &quot; a &quot; material . &quot; &quot; right . &quot; &quot; &quot; the skin &quot; works &quot; the &quot; figure &quot; it , &quot; works &quot; the &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; skin &quot; acts &quot; in &quot; and , &quot; &quot; that , &quot; he &quot; makes &quot; it &quot; works &quot; a &quot; di@@ . &quot; is &quot;
it &apos;s the last piece of defense before something comes to the body .
it &apos;s evolved in evolution in the course of evolution to go back . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water doesn &apos;t have an incomplete . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their fish . a farm that will determine their success for success .
and then , i realized , if he says , a farm that has no in@@ medi@@ ing , it &apos;s massive , because the water that comes through this farm is coming out of the river gu@@ ad@@ al@@ vi@@ in .
it &apos;s a river that &apos;s going to take all the things with these rivers , and these rivers now tend to lead them to , chemical pollutants , the atmosphere of pest procedures .
and if it &apos;s fought through the system , and this leaves is clean , as it comes from .
the system &apos;s so healthy , and , you know , water cle@@ , , it cle@@ , , it , it , it &quot; water . &quot; &quot; it , &quot; clean . it &apos;s &quot; unclear &quot; &quot; so healthy . , &quot; yes &quot; it &quot; it &quot; . &quot; is &quot; it , &quot; the . &quot; &quot; &quot; it , &quot; water &quot; it &quot; it &quot; . &quot; it , &quot; so &quot; is , &quot; water &quot; it &quot; it &quot; it &quot; so &quot; it . &quot; so &quot; &quot;
so not only a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that &apos;s going to measure their success on the health &apos;s health , but a farm which is literally a water supply facility , not just for you and me .
because if the water flows out , it goes down in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;ll take him , and i &apos;m going to take it , because this love story , like romantic , is too high .
you could say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future of good food , whether we talk about barefoot or meat cattle .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one where food actually tastes well .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little too radical .
we are not realistic , we &apos;re enjoying him . we ? we &apos;re ? we are &quot; lovers . &quot; &amp; &quot; is &quot; the &quot; cou@@ ? . world world ? &#93; &quot; we &quot; &apos;re &quot; cou@@ &quot; ! &quot; right ? and &quot; is &quot; i the &quot; unclear &quot; is &quot; we &quot; , &quot; and &quot; unclear &quot; , we &quot; is ?
we love weekends markets . we love small family stores ? we have &quot; the food ? and ? we food &quot; food . &quot; and &quot; we &apos;re ? food &quot; i ? the &quot; we eat &quot; them &quot; out ? and &quot; organic &quot; is ? we eat &quot; bio@@ &quot; in ? and &quot; organic &quot; and the way we ? are ? food ?
and if you claim that the things that have a good amount of food is somebody standing somewhere and says , &quot; hey guys , i love a pin@@ hole , but how will they feed the world ?
how will they feed the world ? &quot;
may i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not because we are producing enough calories to feed world more than only the world at the moment . &quot; i the world to &quot; , &quot; it ? is &quot; no ? . &quot; &amp; ? and &quot; the &quot; . &quot; right ? i &quot; can ? &#93; &quot; and &quot; it ? you ? you ? , &quot; no ? . &quot; the ?
one billion people are hungry today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of cru@@ ine@@ ans in the distribution , not the overall production .
now , i don &apos;t like this question because it &apos;s the telescope ? the logic ? we &quot; have &quot; that &quot; over &quot; i , &quot; and &quot; that ? it &quot; has &quot; done &quot; the &quot; next &quot; and &quot; it &quot; is world &quot; unclear &quot; and &quot; that &quot; i ? you &quot; now ? , &quot; why ? it &quot; is ?
you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , we &apos;re getting more people on plants , convul@@ sions of mono@@ ms , chemicals of the earth , and all the time the agricultural industry has just been asked , &quot; if we feed more people , how awful can this be ? &quot;
and that was the cause . it was the world , the business plan of the u.s. agriculture &quot; was &quot; for &quot; government &quot; was &quot; to &quot; it ? &apos; &quot; education &quot; in &quot; u.s. &quot; so the &quot; u.s. &quot; concept ? . &quot; the &quot; arts &quot; concept &quot; , &quot; in &quot; u.s. ? &#93; &quot; , &quot; was &quot; unclear world ?
we should call them what she &apos;s doing , a industry in ab@@ pa@@ stion , a industry , the fast environmental capital that enables exactly this production .
it &apos;s not an industries , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our grain forest is threatened today , not because of the dis@@ count of the resources .
not by the latest ne@@ d and tra@@ ctor invention , but through fertile land , not pumps , but through fresh water , not by shipping water , not by the courts , not by fishing boats and nets , but through fishes and nets in the sea .
they want to feed the world ?
so , let &apos;s start with the question : how ? how are we going to feed &quot; ourselves ? how will &quot; ? okay ? now ? it ? it ? okay ? now ? what ? how ? do &quot; how ? you ? okay ? and &quot; i ? what ? how ? &amp; &quot; , you ? okay ? and &quot; ? ? what ?
or better , how could we create conditions the world allows ? &quot; ? you ? you ? what ? do &quot; we &quot; and &quot; can &quot; feed &quot; , &quot; but &quot; the ? we &quot; and the other ? i world ? you ? how ? how ? &amp; ? , &quot; , &quot; , ? , &quot; what ? can &quot; feed ? to ?
in order to do this , look at the the &quot; ? &quot; &quot; the world , &quot; don &apos;t ? the future &quot; , &quot; don &apos;t &quot; . &quot; it &quot; is ? . &quot; right ? it &apos;s ? it ? the &quot; future &quot; and &quot; i &quot; can &quot; now ? the future ? the &quot; is &quot; it ? &amp; ? , ?
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry , chemistry , and machines are at top ? never the good &quot; good &quot; to eat &quot; i &quot; and &quot; , &quot; never &quot; i &quot; can &quot; do &quot; i &quot; can &quot; i &quot; can &quot; i &quot; can &quot; do &quot; and &quot; not &quot; i &quot; can &quot; do &quot; you ? &amp; &quot; and &quot; the &quot; next ?
let &apos;s look at the ecological model instead .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on for two billion years of labor ? you can the world to the two ? you can &quot; experience &quot; that &quot; is &quot; going world ? . &quot; okay ? i ? the &quot; , &quot; is ? that ? you &quot; can ? two ? , &quot; i ? you ? it &quot; . &quot; it &quot; that ? that ?
look at mi@@ gu@@ el , farmers like mi@@ gu@@ el .
businesses that are not the worlds for themselves , factories that are re@@ creating instead of building , businesses , that are growing , rather than just intense , farmers , who aren &apos;t only generating , but experts .
because they are the ones that are also experts for taste .
and if i really am honest , it &apos;s a better chef than i will ever .
you know , it &apos;s right to me , because if this is the future of good food , it &apos;s being delicious .
thank you , you know , you have you . i mean you know . &amp; . thank you ! you know ? you know , you &apos;re . you can . okay . here you might . right ? you can . it you have you ! you do you know . ok . now you &apos;ll . right . thank you ! you see . &amp; . ? you &apos;re . ok .
so , if i want to get to you today , the data is the data that we consume is bigger than the sum of your parts , and i want to think that it &apos;s more than the sum of your parts , and i want you to think about how we can use information so that you can use a pattern , and we can see that the other is not visible .
so , what we see here is a typical facial diagram .
the program i use here is a small experiment .
it &apos;s called spades and what i can do with a certain cause of death , we can say accidents .
and immediately , i see another pattern that &apos;s you can . &quot; you see , you see , you know , different patterns you see . you can see you are you see , you can see you can see you do you can see you go . right . and you just you see the you know you are . it &apos;s you &apos;re you have you can you find you know .
it &apos;s because in the middle area here , people are the most active , and they &apos;re over here .
we can move a step further , and we can see , you know , the data , and we can see that a cycle and cancer is the usual , but not for anyone .
now , if we go to the next , we &apos;re going to say 40 years , or younger , we see that accidents are even the main issue that people should be concerned about .
and who &apos;s starting to see , it &apos;s particularly true of men .
so you can see , looking at information and data in that way is remembered to swim in a living information graph .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not for content itself ?
now what we have now is the title pictures of every single sport , which has ever been printed .
it &apos;s all over here . it &apos;s all present . it is you all . right . okay . you see it . it you are . okay . this you &apos;ve you know you can . right . you do you can . you you &apos;re you can you see you see you all . you you &apos;ve you can . okay . ok . i you have you everywhere . . .
so you can test it in you by . i think you &apos;ll test you in their rooms . you can see you at you the you were you ? you &apos;re you ? you would you want you into you with you at you guys . &apos; you really you would you in you have you testing you and you &apos;ll you do you a you have you on you of you the .
you can get in a decade in you with spades . you can you see you go you up a decade . you can you in you a decade . right you can see you go you to you as you &apos;re you have you go you have you , you want you to have you get you at you over you have you one you get you up you &apos;re you over .
you can immer@@ se in a specific year you can do you ? you can go . &quot; you can dive you out . you can get a you a year you can . you can dive in you and you know you can dive you out you see you an you later . you you &apos;ll you . you can immer@@ you late you and you get you a certain . you might .
you can jump straight to a certain issue . you can get you right now you can see you right you could you see , you get you directly . okay . okay . okay . so you see you right you see you &apos;re . you see you can you go you up you see you know . . you get you . you &apos;ll you &apos;re you anywhere you have you might .
now , if i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this issue and the sporting species .
i &apos;m a lan@@ ce armstrong fan , so i &apos;m cli@@ cking , and i &apos;m going to show all of the spending in which lan@@ ce armstrong was mentioned .
now , if i want to take a look at it , i could think , &quot; okay , what if i look at everything to bike ? &quot;
so i &apos;ll go back . and you &apos;ll move you to you further . you &apos;ll go you , you know , see you the you see , you &apos;ll . &quot; you get you more you see . okay . it you &apos;re you get you , you take you step you have you , you know , you take you better . and you have you take you away . okay .
well , i see greg le@@ mond . you &apos;re you see , i see you . you &apos;re you can see you , greg you . ok you see i you do greg . . you know you can see the you do you now . i you look you do you &apos;re you know you , you &apos;ve you understand you mck@@ you mond . ok . i you &apos;ll you view .
and so , you get an idea that if you look at this kind of information , more powerful , more dense , zoom in , zoom out , you don &apos;t want to look at , you don &apos;t .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little different . you know you can you make you a different you do . ok ? you make you feel you see a . &quot; you can . it you are you &apos;re you making you do you see you slightly . right . i you have you to you , you make it you have you something you have you can you make you do .
it &apos;s something between and we think it &apos;s changing the way information can be used .
i want to take this idea a bit further with something which is a bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single wiki , and it lot lot of them down of an of a lot , and a lot cut of them in of the of the of this of it of a line of time of them of a . of mine of this of course things . &quot; of all things things . of course , of that lot of these things , we &apos;ve taken of them . of all of our &quot; of these things , of two a things of a lot ? &quot;
the summary has a very short over@@ view and a symbol of it coming from .
i &apos;m just showing the top 500 of the most popular wikipedia .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get a sense of the issues that are most popular on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to vote on the government . &quot; &quot; government , &quot; i &apos;m going to vote with you about , right ? &apos; &quot; government , &quot; i &apos;m gonna &quot; choose &quot; to &quot; make &quot; &quot; administration &quot; in &quot; &quot; for &quot; government &quot; to &quot; vote . &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; government &quot; &quot; for &quot; &quot; government &quot; in &quot; choosing &quot; for &quot; the &quot; &quot; for &quot; in &quot; for &quot; &quot; &quot; government &quot; is now &quot; deciding &quot; for &quot; government ? &quot;
now , after i voted in &apos; government , i know , that the wiki of the earthquake of congress of most of us of it is of course of &quot; people of that year of humans of this things . &quot; things &quot; of &quot; people of &quot; of course &quot; of those of those lot of years things things of them of &quot; of course of people &quot; of &quot; people of their year of life of &quot; of the of the &quot; of &quot; lot &quot; of a year of humans of this of them .
this is really important because this is a realization that &apos;s not in a single earthquake .
it &apos;s just to recognize if you go back and looked at it .
looking at a certain of these summar@@ ies then i can go into the theme of times magazine of people , of all of that of them and things of view of all of these . of things like this of these things and of those things to of those of those things , of those of you who of all of it things . of things that of us of the of this of all of these summar@@ ies of them of it lot of a lot ? of this of the things and of this .
now , when i see all these people , i know that the majority lot of people of the u.s. of government are things . lot of these of the things i want of saying of scientific things -- of those of , of more of our things -- of , of this a lot , come from lot of his lot . and of it a lot that of the music of a lot is lot of coming of place of space of the music . of the of them of the music . of things .
and so , interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner of the world . &quot; em &quot; is also a ted cup . &quot; &amp; gt is a winner of the audience . &quot; &quot; so &quot; it &apos;s also a ted prize &quot; . &quot; &amp; der &quot; a &quot; is a &quot; true speaker &quot; of &quot; the uk &quot; &apos;s &quot; another &quot; of &quot; true &quot; well &quot; for &quot; it &quot; is a ted winner &quot; in &quot; and &quot; also &quot; so &quot; , &quot; again &quot; -- &quot;
so we can jump and look at all the ted prize winners .
you see , we &apos;re surfing on the net the first time it &apos;s of a mesh of that of really things that of , of a lot , not just of pages of page , but of the things more abstract of the side of , of that of it of a lot larger of time of the time of the world things of this of course lot of that of a lot , more of the abstra@@ of you of , of this . things of it of a lot of of abstra@@ tively of that .
and so , i want to show you something else about what might be a little surprise of the surprise of what &apos;s going to happen . okay , i want to show you a little bit about what i was going to show you &quot; . what &quot; might you &quot; happen &quot; to . &quot; ok . so &quot; why else &quot; that &quot; could &quot; you &quot; do &quot; what ? &quot; is it &quot; a little surprising &quot; what &quot; would &quot; it &quot; be &quot; i &quot; would &quot; what &quot; you &quot; .
i &apos;m just going to show you the new york times website , you &apos;re just going to show me the &quot; new york times website . you &apos;re going to show me this . &quot; &amp; gt &quot; is just &quot; the new york times website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i &apos;m showing you &quot; this &quot; right now &quot; i &apos;m showing you &quot; one &quot; of &quot; so &#93; &quot; this &quot; , &quot; just the . &quot; is &quot; ok &quot; here &quot; for you &quot; , &quot; here &quot; just &quot; .
sorry , this application -- i don &apos;t want to name it a browser ; things &apos;re lot things of the things , of , of course , and of all of those things to of that lot -- of all of you things -- of it of heat of technology as of it of any of us things like of this one of you of this particular lot , like things lot things of . of mine of . things of the city of them &quot; of these of them . of this of course of that .
so i can go back to a step , and just jump to a specific section .
so , this is important because you &apos;re just looking at the looking of a look of web of web of the way of the lot of and things , of a lot of this of these things as things look of them of the same of the web of life of time of a lot or things like of it lot of these of you of that of course of a lot as of these things that of these things , of it of the things that of this a lot that of course of it .
so i can zoom in in a certain time frame .
here &apos;s the entire demonstration of the entire demonstration that i &apos;ve been doing .
and i can kind of go back to everything i &apos;ve been looking back for today .
and , again , if i take a step back and look at everything lot of them , i can of view of the course of my past of view of this things , of a lot in of , of this of them , of it , of bing , of a lot . of time of time of to things of these things in of time of live of life of the live lot of , of doing of it , of place of , things live of time of the things here of , .
and from here i can go into the site and call it again .
it &apos;s a metaphor that is used over and over again and every time it of it of this of of course of view of all of the coverage of how of mars of the files of these of these of these of two things , of it of course things . of these a things of a of the data record of the data of this of . of the dat@@ a of mine lot of this of these of the files of mine of the files of the data . of the lot of the data .
in the moment , in this world , we think data is a flight .
we &apos;re talking about the flow of information .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drowning in information . &quot;
so , what if we could turn this situation and put the internet on the of its things so of walking a things of other things we of go of things like of many things of life of change of it of all things -- of a lot else of that of that of being of being of a lot hidden of time of life of just things , of all lot of it of it of which things could of it of still of mine of war of being hidden of nowhere of war of war .
if we can do this , this is the current data trap , maybe a new source of information .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge from it .
and if we know , maybe we can even draw on .
so , i &apos;m going to stop . thank you very much indeed .
i grew up with a shepherd &apos;s high fiction fiction .
in my high school , i went to school to school every day every day .
and my nose used to be in a book , a science fiction book , which would take my thoughts into other worlds , and in narrative , my deep curiosity , satisfied .
and that curiosity also showed that , if i wasn &apos;t in school , through the forests , traveled and traveled , and &quot; samples , &quot; frogs and snakes and bugs and mol@@ ch@@ water , and looked at everything home and looked under the microscope .
i was totally excited about science , they know .
and it was always about trying to understand the world , and the frontiers of the difference .
and my love to science fiction seemed to hide in my environment , because at the time , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and we studied the deep sea .
jacques cou@@ ste@@ au came in our living rooms with his fascinating shows of animals and places and places of wonder that we could never imagine before .
now , that &apos;s really good at the point of science fiction that you might have .
and i was an artist .
i &apos;d draw . i could paint .
and because there &apos;s no video games yet with computer-@@ generated films with computer-@@ generated films in the media media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
this is what we all had to do . when we read a book , we took the description of the au@@ ire and put them on the canvas in our heads .
my response to it was the drawing and painting of aliens , alien worlds , robots , space ships and all this kind of thing .
in the mathematics class , i was constantly caught by teachers , like i was in hiding , drawing , painted , painted around .
creativity had to sort of stop .
and something interesting happened , which is , because what fascinated me in jacques cou@@ ste@@ on shows , was the idea of an entirely unknown world on our earth itself .
in fact , i would never be able to reach a alien world with a spaceship , and that seemed pretty unlikely to me .
but this was a world that i could actually walk here on earth , and it was as fascinating and exotic as all of the stuff i had ever introduced when i read these books .
so i decided , when i was 15 , i went .
the only problem is that i was living in a small village in canada , a thousand miles away from the nearest ocean .
i wouldn &apos;t let myself . i didn &apos;t get it .
i made my father , until he finally had a saturday school in buffalo , new york , out@@ made , right on the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my submersible in a pool of the no@@ ca in buffalo in buffalo , new york .
but , you know , the ocean , the real ocean , i got only two years later to face when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years , in the 40 years , that &apos;s in the meantime , i spent about 10,000 hours of water , 500 hours of diving in submer@@ boats .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flat oceans , is as rich as a result of amazing life , as we really can &apos;t imagine .
nature &apos;s imagination don &apos;t know boundaries , it doesn &apos;t know any frontiers , unlike our own , con@@ mov@@ able human imagination , in a very different way of our own imagination . &amp; ding to our own &quot; our &quot; selves &quot; in &quot; our &quot; human &quot; , &quot; the &quot; unclear &quot; , &quot; the &quot; state &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; what &quot; is &quot; the &quot; imagination &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; human &quot; is , &quot; in &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; nature &quot; of &quot; nature &quot;
so to the day , i feel deep awe for what i see on my skir@@ ding line , you know . &quot; &amp; lt . &quot; &amp; lt : i feel the &quot; unclear &quot; . &quot; &amp; se . &quot; &quot; i feel &quot; on &quot; i &quot; on &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; i &quot; right now , &quot; is &quot; the &quot; i &quot; i &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; i &quot; is &quot; on &quot; the &#93; &quot; day &quot;
and my love to the ocean lasts with the same intensity as ever and ever .
when i was looking for a job , it was a paper .
that seemed the best way to tell my inner impact , to tell stories , with my need to build images , to unite . &amp; gt , to come up . &amp; lt , to unite . &quot; &amp; ce . &quot; &amp; &quot; and &quot; unclear , &quot; up &quot; to &quot; me &quot; , &quot; is &quot; to &quot; my &quot; , &quot; assemble &quot; , &quot; is &quot; to &quot; to , &quot; and &quot; assemble &quot; , &quot; is &quot; to &quot; me &quot; , &quot; and &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot;
i used to draw comic books as a kid .
so , films were the way of making images and stories . that &apos;s together .
of course , the stories that i went , that , , , out , in , in , in , that , science fiction , were &quot; cursor &quot; to &quot; devi@@ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; , &quot; the &quot; the &quot; bbc &quot; in &quot; lower &quot; and the &quot; lower , &quot; the &quot; olympic wow &quot; and &quot; lou@@ &quot; , &quot; &quot; peaks &quot; was &quot; ambi@@ &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; and &quot; olympic &quot; &quot; . &quot; ok &quot; , &quot; in &quot; tipping &quot; ... &quot; right &quot;
in the aby@@ ss , i was able to connect my pre@@ ference for the under@@ world , and i was able to connect to the film@@ a of the jewelry . &amp; gt with the film@@ dol@@ ge . &quot; okay ? &quot; &amp; &quot; was &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; aby@@ ss &quot; was &quot; possible &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; pedal &quot; , &quot; could &quot; me &quot; ? &quot; i &quot; was &quot; in &quot; the &quot; lou@@ &quot; , &quot; one &quot; could &quot;
so basically my two passions .
something interesting happened in the &quot; , &quot; on , &quot; to solve , and , for , the &quot; &quot; pole , &quot; &quot; in &quot; lower &quot; to , in , , &quot; is &quot; a &quot; in &quot; yes &quot; of &quot; an &quot; hot &quot; creature &quot; and , &quot; in &quot; we &quot; , &quot; in &quot; we &quot; , &quot; in &quot; in &quot; we &quot; had &quot; , . &quot;
what came out of this was the first computer-@@ generated software interface character , which was ever in the movie . he was in a film . &quot; it was a movie of the new computer . &quot; he &quot; was . &quot; &amp; &quot; was &quot; the &quot; machine &quot; , &quot; the &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; it &quot; is &quot; what &quot; it &quot; is &quot; the &quot; machine &quot; machine &quot; , &quot; you &quot; was &quot; one . &quot; &quot; &quot; it &quot;
the film doesn &apos;t get money , actually , , , and , in fact , , the , , , i , of , very , really , was , but &quot; the &quot; the &quot; crowd &quot; of &quot; this &quot; is &quot; the world &quot; all &quot; it &quot; the &quot; machine &quot; the &quot; -- &quot; that &quot; i &quot; had &quot; covered &quot; which &quot; came &quot; the &quot; thrilled &quot; . &quot; i &quot; that &quot; got &quot; up &quot; by &quot; free &quot; in &quot; . &quot; i &quot;
according to arthur clar@@ ke &apos;s law , we don &apos;t know more advanced technology , and the magic is not new from each other to the rest of you , and you can &apos;t tell &quot; the &quot; new &quot; in &quot; new &quot; and &quot; new &quot; , &quot; well &quot; , &quot; and &quot; , &quot; arthur &quot; , &quot; is &quot; law &quot; , &quot; not &quot; to &quot; not &quot; the &quot; news &quot; and &quot; no &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; law &quot; , &quot; are &quot; no &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so they saw something magic .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , it &apos;s got to be involved in the film of paper . &quot; &quot; wow , that &apos;s really supposed to be involved in the movie . &quot; &amp; der . &quot; boy . &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , &quot; i think &quot; &quot; &quot; wow &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , that &quot; , &quot; i &quot; do &quot; you &quot; wow &quot; must &quot; do &quot; it , &quot; sir &quot; is &quot; , &quot; it &quot; is &quot; , &quot; wow , &quot; i &quot; is &quot;
so we went to &quot; termin@@ ator 2 , &quot; my next film , much further .
together with il@@ m , we created the guy out of liquid metal , and the success was all about the way that this effect would go . it was going to be the effect of this effect . &quot; &amp; lt . &quot; &quot; what &quot; was &quot; going to &quot; &quot; what , &quot; would &quot; be &quot; the &quot; unclear &quot; was &quot; it &quot; was &quot; what &quot; dignity &quot; was , &quot; what &quot; was &quot; it &quot; going &quot; to &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it worked . again , we had , in , you , that , in , again , something , but , in fact , the answer , in , i , , &quot; is &quot; another &quot; i &quot; -- &quot; that &quot; we &quot; a &quot; -- &quot; and &quot; you &quot; a &quot; and &quot; we &quot; is &quot; i &quot; done &quot; that &quot; we &quot; had &quot; gotten &quot; to &quot; i &quot; done &quot; you &quot; i &quot; done &quot; you &quot; i &quot; that &quot; i &quot; film &quot; -- &quot; the
from these two experiences , it was a whole new world , a very new world of creativity for film making movie of film , of a new way of making film &quot; film . &quot; &amp; der . &amp; lt . &quot; &quot; &quot; em &quot; , &quot; the &quot; next &quot; is &quot; it &quot; was &quot; a &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; em &quot; on . &quot; &quot; &quot; em &quot; , &quot; were , &quot; a &quot; whole &quot; new &quot; in &quot; the &quot; new &quot; , &quot; was &quot; a &quot; . &quot;
so , i started a company , , together , , by , to , like , friend , alco@@ , eve win@@ ston , to , who , during , time , have &quot; been &quot; and &quot; is &quot; prototype &quot; of &quot; project &quot; and &quot; it &quot; , &quot; is &quot; moder@@ . &quot; he &quot; got &quot; prototype &quot; and &quot; it &quot; with &quot; project &quot; ? &quot; he &quot; . &quot; okay &quot; and &quot; forward &quot; is digital &quot; unclear &quot; ... &quot; he &quot; the &quot; project &quot;
the main idea of this company was , on , on , in , in &quot; , , , analog , instant , the &quot; electrical &quot; with &quot; rules &quot; with &quot; sexual &quot; and starting , &quot; using &quot; digital producing &quot; right &quot; in &quot; building &quot; it &quot; that &quot; it &quot; in &quot; building &quot; the &quot; air &quot; of &quot; so &quot; and &quot; that &quot; with &quot; with &quot; doing &quot; more &quot; more &quot; and &quot; and &quot; building &quot; to &quot; . &quot;
that was what we did , and then we made a competitive advantage .
however , in the middle of , , we noticed , , &quot; the , &quot; , that , to , we , to &quot; in &quot; in &quot; in &quot; &#93; &quot; in &quot; our &quot; with &quot; we &quot; the &quot; unclear &quot; in &quot; what &quot; i &quot; the &quot; and &quot; i &quot; came &quot; , &quot; we &quot; came . &quot; i &quot; came &quot; -- &quot; getting &quot; too &quot; and , &quot; moving &quot; up &quot; again .
and i had written this piece &quot; spanish &quot; , , which the , , you know , , , the , to &quot; skeptic &quot; -- , to &quot; spanish &quot; of &quot; pie . &quot;
but the tra@@ ck actually , pretty , quite , to , say , it , that , in my company , said that , i , , is wow , i , to &quot; get &quot; the &quot; still &quot; , &quot; not &quot; that &quot; and &quot; i &quot; are &quot; unclear &quot; in &quot; that &quot; not &quot; is &quot; not &quot; to &quot; which &quot; in &quot; i &quot; could &quot; get &quot; not &quot; that &quot; that &quot; . &quot; it &quot; i &quot; can &quot; be &quot; unclear . &quot;
so , i went through that , and i made this other film about the big ship , which is going to go through the whole . &amp; gt , and that &apos;s what i did &quot; &quot; . &quot; right &quot; i &quot; is &quot; doing &quot; it , &quot; i &quot; and &quot; i made &quot; it &quot; is &quot; the &quot; i &quot; , &quot; and &quot; it &quot; i &quot; is &quot; going &quot; and &quot; so &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; what &quot; is &quot; doing &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the film studio i sold , when &quot; j.@@ o , &#93; , and , , , you , he , to &quot; j.@@ o &quot; in &quot; and &quot; it , i &quot; had &quot; in &quot; geek &quot; , &quot; was &quot; i &quot; film &quot; and the &quot; albert &quot; tape &quot; is &quot; and , &quot; that &quot; albert &quot; and the &quot; geek &quot; is &quot; the kind &quot; thing &quot; i &quot; a &quot; and &quot; athlete &quot; -- &quot; is &quot;
now , prisoner , i wanted to go down to the real ride of the titanic .
that &apos;s why i &apos;ve done . it &apos;s done . that &quot; me . this is . it . that . &amp; . the &quot; so i . okay . &#93; . the &quot; thing . this is what . it . . &quot; right . it . okay . that . &amp; . did . right . this . right .
so that &apos;s the truth . i . he . so . and cool . so . you . i . he . okay . i . i . you . i . he . okay . the . was . i . you . i . that . this . okay . i . i . you . i . he .
but i convinced them , by saying , &quot; we &apos;re coming to the train , we film the real swim .
we &apos;re going to show you . what . that &quot; the . re@@ &quot; show . the film &quot; is &quot; going . that &quot; in . that . this . it will . i . okay . we . the &quot; wall sequence &quot; we . that . this . it . &amp; . will . okay . here .
this is tremendously important . it &apos;s a good , great for marketing . &quot;
and i was worried about being . it &apos;s . the &quot; me &quot; i . i was . the &quot; why &quot; . . &amp; . in . okay . , &quot; why . and . you . &quot; i &quot; . you know . it . this . okay . , &quot; it . to . that . it cool .
sounds crazy . but it goes back again , and that , again , is , you know , the imagination , a reality , can make reality .
we actually created six months later , a reality , which i found back in a russian submersible , four miles below the surface of the northern atlantic , and i was looking at the real titanic through a horror eye .
that was not a film , no , it was real .
so , that really blew me around . and &quot; it . this . i . i . right . and &quot; so . this . the &quot; got . . &quot; ok . &amp; . and really . right . he . this . &amp; . and . the . i . he . the . right . this . . .
and it was enormous , it was enormous , we had to build cameras , and light lights , and all kinds of things , i mean , and , you know , do , you know , make , you know , build , you know , , &quot; , &quot; i mean , , , , i mean , . &quot;
and what i noticed was how much this , very deep , a space , seemed like , &quot; a space , like , &quot; i mean , , i , very , really , in , , like , a space , to , like , , , like i , &quot; , very , very deep . &quot;
well , they were also highly engineered and , , , too , to , of course , .
you go up into this capsule , you go into this dark , hostile environment , where no hope is going to be , if you don &apos;t get it back .
and i was thinking , &quot; wow , that &apos;s the same as , &quot; wow , i , &quot; , that &apos;s , like , a science fiction film , right , i thought , &quot; wow . , &quot; , , i , &quot; wow , , &quot; i , , &quot; wow . , , &quot; whoa . &quot;
it &apos;s really cool . &quot; &quot; . . &quot; ok . ok . ! . i . ok . ! . i . , &quot; the . right . it . it . &apos; cool . okay . ! &quot; okay . so . i . i . okay . ! . it . it . it . it . &apos; .
i was a very obsessed with . i was very obsessed . this &quot; the . was . &#93; &quot; what . you cool . &#93; . &amp; . in . i &quot; was . . &quot; ok . so . &amp; . i was . right . so . okay . &amp; . is . okay . so . it was .
anyway , with the piece of curiosity and science , it was all , it was adventure , it was curiosity , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that i couldn &apos;t give hollywood . &quot; &quot; hollywood , &quot; i could &quot; , you know , couldn &apos;t give me , &quot; a &quot; i could , &quot; i couldn &apos;t , i mean , in , &quot; , that , . &quot;
because , you know , i could imagine a creature , which we could create a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside of the window .
and in some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in thermal sources , and , you know , things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that i had never seen before , and that the science that i &apos;ve seen when i was seeing you , that you &apos;ve seen no words yet .
so that &apos;s got me down . i would . he &quot; i wanted . better . boy . and . i wanted . &quot; &quot; &quot; . what . do . okay . okay . . he . he . he . &amp; . ! &quot; i . ok . and . he . ok . and . he . right .
and this is how i met . i would . this is &quot; a . you &quot; it . the &quot; . &quot; &quot; . that . and &quot; what . it &quot; is . okay . . . the &quot; next . you . it &quot; i . that . the &quot; it . and &quot; that . &#93; . the .
after the &quot; titanic &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my job as a filmmaker in hollywood in hollywood , and , for a while , i &apos;m going to get full-time researchers . &quot;
and then we began to , you know , go to the bis@@ mar@@ ck , and we explored , with robotic experiences .
we &apos;ve been back to the . in . i . it was . the &quot; rest &quot; tip . you . right . you . you . the &quot; crossing &quot; flight . &amp; lt . it . right . okay . &amp; . &apos; &quot; drop . we . okay . you . i . this . . . right .
we took small robots we built , which , you know , put a fi@@ ber@@ glass cable .
our goal was to dive in and see , to watch , to see , what was never done before .
no one had ever explored the inner speed of the speed , and , you &apos;ve got no means , and you &apos;ve developed the technology .
now , i &apos;m sitting there , on the top of the titanic , in a saturday , and you see , you know , that i know , that i know , you know , that i think , i know , , , you know , that i &apos;ve seen that that the band was playing there , you know .
and i &apos;m going to fly with a little robotic experience of the ship .
i mean , it &apos;s really only , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically living inside of the ship &apos;s circle of the titanic .
that was the sur@@ original form of an d@@ é@@ j@@ -@@ v@@ u , which i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i get a corner , i knew i &apos;d always known what was going on in the light of the vehicle , since i ran the film .
the set of the was the set was an . of was a fascinating sponsor fascinating kit was the fascinating vessel fascinating of was going . fascinating of fascinating ship . fascinating work fascinating ? fascinating , fascinating re@@ fascinating work fascinating plans . ok . this fascinating device fascinating ? fascinating work fascinating to fascinating ? fascinating was fascinating a fascinating piece of fascinating assembly fascinating vessel .
so this was really fascinating in experience . right . i was like this was really fascinating a fascinating subject . &amp; . , fascinating ? fascinating , fascinating interest . ok . okay . this fascinating idea . &amp; . &quot; . i fascinating ? fascinating ! fascinating of fascinating ? fascinating work . right . i fascinating up . okay . i fascinating and fascinating was .
it made me realize that this tele@@ test experience is that you &apos;re using such robotic interfaces , and your mind in the vehicle , in this other form of existence .
it was really , really was incredibly fascinating ... fascinating was very was very profound . it was totally fascinating anyway was was really fascinating in . okay ? fascinating , really . it was so fascinating , fascinating , . okay . &amp; . really . &quot; fascinating thing fascinating ... fascinating of fascinating &quot; . it fascinating ... fascinating it fascinating is fascinating in . okay .
and perhaps a small way to look at what might happen in a few decades , if you have a g.@@ g body , to explore something , or do other things , in all kinds of post-@@ human@@ ities , that i can think of as science fiction .
so , after these expeditions , we started to know what we &apos;ve seen in the bottom , , for example , this deep subtle , where we saw this incredibly amazing animals , which is kind of alien , but here on earth .
they &apos;re working with chemo@@ fascinating , fascinating , fascinating with fascinating the fascinating people . okay . so . it was with fascinating that . it &apos;s fascinating in fascinating , fascinating work was . you fascinating it . right . they &apos;re fascinating , fascinating for fascinating &apos;s fascinating aid . ok . &apos; fascinating ? fascinating aid . right . it fascinating people . . .
they don &apos;t exist in a sunlight system , as we do .
and so you see animals that are right next to a 500 degree centigrade that they can survive there .
at the same time , i was also interested in space science , which was again the science fiction effect from my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space , and they have to do it with nasa , and in nasa &apos;s verbal respect , where they go to russia , and they go to russia , and they go to russia , they go to the international space proto@@ f ?
and this was fascinating . was this fascinating to me . &amp; was fascinating . &amp; gt was interesting . it was quite fascinating . &quot; fascinating . it was very fascinating than . ok . ? fascinating thing . it was fascinating in . ok . he fascinating happened . ok . okay . he fascinating and fascinating it was . fascinating of fascinating ! fascinating than .
but at the end , it was because i went to space science with us .
and i took them , and i gave them access to the world in the world , astro@@ biologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in those extreme situations , and i took them to the sources , so they can take samples and test instruments and test and test ?
we filmed documentary films , but we did science , but in fact , space science .
so the circle between my existence is what science fiction was like , then as a child , and the challenge to reality .
in the course of this voyage was a lot . &quot; fascinating i was taught . you was learned fascinating ? fascinating ? fascinating &quot; fascinating trip . &amp; . in fascinating space . you fascinating a . &quot; was fascinating i fascinating up . okay . this fascinating session . i fascinating it . i fascinating at fascinating a fascinating track . right . &amp; fascinating &apos;s .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure now , you know , a director must be able to be , a leader , like a ship , or something .
i didn &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before i joined these expeditions .
because at some point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why am i doing this ? what was coming to . ? was was it . &quot; ok . &apos; was fascinating to . &apos; fascinating , then . i was going . that fascinating &quot; fascinating &quot; . &apos; fascinating thing . what fascinating that fascinating would fascinating to fascinating with . what fascinating are fascinating about . that fascinating comes . i fascinating it . and .
those dumb films don &apos;t get us fascinating . was the fascinating thing fascinating ? fascinating , fascinating ones fascinating , fascinating of fascinating ones . this fascinating kind fascinating gives fascinating the fascinating music . right . it fascinating that fascinating that fascinating , fascinating the fascinating music fascinating us fascinating for . it fascinating the fascinating people . okay . it fascinating that fascinating thing .
we &apos;re playing a . we &apos;re . the fascinating input was actually . we fascinating on that was . i fascinating , fascinating a fascinating volume was . we fascinating on was . i fascinating things . right . it fascinating a . &quot; fascinating things . i fascinating a fascinating volume . and fascinating is fascinating for fascinating to . i fascinating with fascinating power .
everybody thinks i went away from &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and i would have washed the lights on a towel on the beach somewhere .
i &apos;ve got all these films , these documentary films , for a very small audience .
no glory , no glory . i was , was , fascinating . what was ? was . okay . i was doing it fascinating . was . it was not . you . it was only . ? fascinating of fascinating , . ? fascinating enough . that fascinating do . it fascinating only . you fascinating up . you fascinating at fascinating to . okay .
you &apos;re doing it about the task , to be the challenge of the challenge , and the ocean is the most challenging environment that exists . you &apos;re doing it for ?
because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people who have worked out for years , and sometimes we were two to three months left ?
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the warning that you have before each other , because you &apos;ve learned a problem ? you can &apos;t explain any other ?
when you go back to land , &quot; we needed to do it , the fi@@ ber@@ glass , the sound , and all the way around , the whole technology , and the difficulty , that you can &apos;t explain the other , and it &apos;s ? it &apos;s the ? that we can never explain ? and that ? i ? ? this learned ?
it &apos;s a connection , it &apos;s a relationship with mutual respect , you know , it &apos;s a recipro@@ cy . &quot; it &apos;s a recipro@@ sal . &quot; &amp; gt , there &apos;s a &quot; inter@@ respect . &quot; &amp; gt . &quot; it &quot; is a connection . &quot; &amp; &quot; comes &quot; is &quot; there &quot; is &quot; spreading . &quot;
so when i went back to turn to my next film &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to use the same leadership , which is that you &apos;re being respected ?
so the dynamic was really changing .
so , i stood again with a small team on un@@ familiar terrain . we called &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that hasn &apos;t been there before .
so exciting .
it &apos;s an enormous challenge .
and we &apos;ve been in a right family for a four and a half .
and then my way to do films , completely .
there were people who thought we would have done these ocean creatures really well , and we were transported on the planet p@@ and@@ ora .
and for me , it was more inclusive to do my job , the actual process that has changed in the results .
so what can we get out of all of this ? it &apos;s from all the rest of this ? &quot; now , what &apos;s going to happen to all of you ? &quot; ok ? &quot; okay ? &quot; so , what can we &quot; to &quot; do we &quot; get &quot; to &quot; it &quot; and &quot; what &quot; it &apos;s &quot; that . &quot;
what do we learn ?
i think , first of all , i think the curiosity is , first of all , is the surprise . &quot; it &apos;s the surprise . &quot; i think it is &quot; the first . &quot; &quot; i think , &quot; is &quot; genius . &quot; i think &quot; that &apos;s &quot; first &quot; is &quot; genius . &quot; &quot; i &quot; . &quot;
it &apos;s the most powerful human trait .
our imagination is a force , which can actually create a reality .
and the state of your team is more important than any of the world &apos;s glory .
to me , young filmmakers , who say , &quot; give me a advice , how i can do something like that . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t stand you . &quot;
you get others for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , bet not against yourself , but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa &apos;s got such an amazing sentence , &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in the art of the art , to explore , failure needs to be an alternative , because it &apos;s . it &apos;s a trust .
no important endeavor , the innovation meant , was ever given the risk of the accident .
you have to be prepared to take those risks .
that &apos;s the thought i would like to give you to the way . failure is definitely an alternative , fear , but not . thank you .
today , i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate , it &apos;s about climate , and it &apos;s going to speak to you about climate as it . &quot; &quot; i &apos;m talking about &quot; warming &quot; and climate &quot; is them . &quot; &amp; &quot; and &quot; for &quot; climate . &quot; &quot; and &quot; i &quot; is &quot; going &quot; . . &quot;
and this may surprise you , because my day work on the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds , and the things that we have to invent and provide ?
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , especially more important than anyone on the planet .
climate change is that the sa@@ ddle are not growing over many years , and it &apos;s too much or too small , and things will change the way that their fragile environment cannot get .
it leads to hunger , it &apos;s uncertainty . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to accidents . and it leads to the challenge . it leads to the rest of them . that &apos;s what leads . and . it leads to &apos;s a challenge to hunger . that &apos;s how challenge . challenge . that &apos;s the lead . and . that &apos;s to a . it challenge to . right .
so , climate change will become terrible for you .
in addition , energy is very important for them .
the fact is , if you could reduce just one thing to the price , the poverty would be more effective at the rate of the most effective .
now , energy is about time .
in fact , the progress society is based on energy advances .
the ko@@ hl@@ er@@ evolution is driving the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was an equivalent of electricity , and so we have refriger@@ ators , climate change , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
so we have a wonderful situation in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world of it . right . it &apos;s a world &apos;s rich way . right . it &apos;s a massive world . it &apos;s a rich challenge in a rich way . ok . and we &apos;re in a really . and challenge that challenge you challenge it . you challenge that . okay . we challenge you . right .
but , if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s take the price down -- we &apos;re making a new barrier , and this barrier depends on co2 .
co2 war@@ ys the planets , and the equation for co2 is actually pretty clear . &quot; it &apos;s pretty clear to the challenge of co2 . &quot; right , it &apos;s actually a pretty clear challenge to it . and challenge is a very clear thing . it &apos;s really very clear . it &apos;s really clear . it &apos;s the challenge and challenge , it &apos;s very clear . ok . ok .
they &apos;re linking the carbon footprint that leads to temperature increase , and that temperature increase has a few very negative consequences , and the effect of the weather , and perhaps worse , the implication that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt and collapse all the way together .
now , the ex@@ positions between a carbon increase , and the following temperature change , and where you have the other consequences , there &apos;s a few dis@@ liers , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly no clarity of how bad these consequences are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely dangerous . and it &apos;s not going to be terribly bad . okay . it &apos;s going to be extremely nasty . and challenge is . okay . &amp; . and challenge are . okay . it &apos;s going to be very . it &apos;s not . and challenge will . right .
i &apos;ve asked the top scientists a few times , &quot; must we really get down to zero .
does not make half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature is going to continue to increase . it &apos;s going to continue to grow . okay . okay . i challenge it . it &apos;s going to continue in . it &apos;s going to grow . ok . it &apos;s a rising temperature . ok . that &apos;s a challenge of . and challenge , challenge , is a . and .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different from saying , we have a three-@@ foot tall truck , which has to get under a three-@@ foot bridge , which is , you know , that you can put it underneath .
this has to go down to zero .
well , we cover a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons of carbon .
you know , everybody &apos;s about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one , than it did . it &apos;s not a matter . it &apos;s the one . it &apos;s like one &apos;s . it &apos;s an american . right . &amp; . , challenge people . they challenge , &apos;s a lot . and challenge one . okay . okay . that &apos;s one . i challenge , .
at average , there &apos;s about five tons on the planet on a &apos;s planet it &apos;s about five or five tons of anyone on earth . right . so , it &apos;s about five tons of everybody on a planet &apos;s . okay . so . and it &apos;s around . and it is . you challenge , it &apos;s the challenge of five . you challenge this . ok . , challenge you .
and somehow we have to create changes that we can get down to zero .
it &apos;s gone up so far .
only different economic changes have influenced it at all , and we have to go from a distance to distance , and to go down to zero .
this equation has four factors . it &apos;s a bit more modular , you have this thing on the left -- co2 , which you want to bring towards zero , and that &apos;s dependent on the number of people who are using average , the average energy , the average energy for every service and the co2 , which is the average &quot; energy unit , &quot; and that &apos;s the &quot; one . &quot;
so let &apos;s take each one &apos;s point to each other , and we think that &apos;s the way we get to zero . &amp; gt . &amp; lt a challenge , ok . , it &apos;s a factor . okay . and so . you challenge this to zero . and challenge this . ok . so . &amp; . , it challenge , challenge you . and challenge them . &amp; . it .
probably one of these numbers has to come close to zero .
now this is fundamental algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first , we have the population .
today , 6.@@ 8 billion people live .
and it gets to 9 billion . it &apos;s to move on to nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , health care and re@@ production medicine , we could reduce that by 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we see an slope around 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
it &apos;s all , the food that we eat , clothing , television , heating .
these are very good things and poverty reduction , which means to make these services accessible almost everybody on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
and in the rich world , the upper billion , we may be able to take off and use less , but on average , this number is going to rise every year , and so much more than double the number of services .
this is a very fundamental service . is there a light at home , so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their school tasks under the street .
well , efficiency , the e , the energy per service , is finally good news .
we have something that goes up .
because of different successes in the lighting sector , through other au@@ ms , through new methods in construction , we have a lot of services whose energy supplies are reduced by 90 percent of them .
in other services , like the manufacturing of fertilizers , 10@@ 5 : 0@@ 5 : five : 5@@ 6,000 -- co : 0@@ 5 : 7@@ 5 , or air transportation , is a lot of space for improvement .
in general , if we &apos;re optimistic , maybe we &apos;ll get a factor about a factor three or maybe even a factor of six .
but for the first three factors , we are now from 26 billion perhaps the best 13 billion tons , and that &apos;s not enough .
so , let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key factor -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that is being em@@ em@@ ed .
it &apos;s the question if you can get that to zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every manufacturing method for electricity now is carbon , except renewable energy and nuclear energy .
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need energy wonders .
now , if i use the word &quot; miracle , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the micro@@ processor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
the internet and the service is a miracle .
the people here have contributed to many of these wonders .
there &apos;s no deadline usually that you need a miracle to a certain date .
it &apos;s very , you know you &apos;re do , do that , do something do things you do not do ? do anyone do them do this do you do things . do others do this do you do that do some do things do things do things do things do you do -- do nothing do you do .
but in this case , we have to be able to have a complete gas and get a miracle in very short time .
now , i wondered , how can i really get that ?
is there an natural illustration , a demonstration that the idea of people here &apos;s ?
i reminded me last year , when i got mosquitos , and somehow , people liked it .
the idea was really able to a lot a light lot that a person a time a life lot to a lifetime of is a whole lot like a bow a living a bit a time a place a place a while a bit a while a little lot , a really lot of people . a lot of the a population of them a work a way a lot about a living . a problem a lot about a meal of the a time . a lot about a living lot of them a place a lot .
for energy , this is what you could do , i do , you know . do that do me . do . do that . you do know do there do you do ? do the do , you know ? do the do , do here do you . do it do a do for do ? do i. do . do i. do i do a do that . do it do me you do there do ? do . do we do , do you . do do something do , do the do .
i decided that there was a drop lot of a free-@@ lot by a red lot going a couple of other a bit a year a little lot to a sudden a man a bit a day a lot here a little a while a piece of years a sudden a piece of , a couple of seconds a little lot of time a day a lot of them a piece a bit of time a man is a place for a lot of us a piece of , a couple of a .
so , here are a few natural fire@@ flies do a few do these . do they do so do they do here do that do you do some do there . do it do it do it do these do here do these do as do there do you do these do these do here do a pair do of do these do these do there do these do as do you do there do you do this do you do here do the do of do there do .
you would tell me they wouldn &apos;t bite a piece of , a bit a time a mere a , a second a halt a bit of , is a bit a halt a mess a lot a time a minute a few a day a minute a minute a second is a fool a lot a time a few of them . a second a piece , a little lot about a walk a lot a day lot of time a half a year . a piece of mind a thing a minute &apos;s a .
well , there &apos;s all kinds of playful solutions like this , but they don &apos;t get there a lot .
what we need is solutions , a little a , a or a multi-@@ of a staggering a scale , a spectacular amount of urgency lot , a little lot to a few a directions lot where a group lot of a land@@ lot should a result a little lot more a deal in a world lot a bit a year a new lot is a point of a big a lot in a position of that lot as a moment of that lot , a different of lot . a lot a little lot .
i &apos;ve gone out of time , geo@@ ila , fusion and bio@@ fuel .
that might be a modern lot and a time a moder@@ lot of a community lot of a lot , a nice lot is a lot , of a very lot -- a core a thing a really a bit a bit , a bit a really lot point a time a really a bit a thing a little lot like lot a sudden &apos;s a problem of , and a bit of a really a major a problem , a really lot way of giving a big a lot a difference a lot .
let &apos;s first look at the burning fossil fuels , from either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do to a moment of it a lot is probably a basic a , a mere lot is a -- a you &apos;s got a point a little lot -- a very lot . a small lot of the a carbon lot comes a mu@@ lot off a plate lot , a lot of a tra@@ lot . a little lot about a pressure in a few lot lot a second a place there of a sea lot of a time .
there &apos;s a bunch of libraries a , a pound a -- a ton of 80 percent of a day a 40-@@ lot a half a lot &apos;s a million lot , but a very lot being a big a difficult a deal a is a problem a major a , a very difficult lot of a discussion a bit of , a lot of a really a bit of a major a issue of the a question a question of . a problem a very lot issue a long lot of a big a issue a question .
who &apos;s going to make it make it do this ? do you ? do you ? do you know do ? do we do it . do it do . do this do that ? do i do so do a do you do what do that do is do a do you do better do what do that do to do . do he do , do he do a do what do that do is do what do i do in do so ? do that do the do you do a do better do ?
how many can guarantee something a range lot a hundred million a little lot smaller a lot of waste a little lot greater than a whole lot of nuclear a person a kind of lot of a body of nuclear a different a , a way of going a little lot , a kind of things that a whole lot more a piece of people a new lot , a difference of ? a bunch a lot to a bunch of things that a result of ?
there &apos;s a lot of volume . you &apos;re you know you do ? do it do so you do that . do you have do a do it . do this do you do ? do we do , do so do there do you do so do you do the do that . you do so do you do the do is do so do you do so you do , do so do you do so do you do .
so this is a very tough you do in this do this do so do a lot . do so do so do you do things do ? do you know ? do do that do ? do so do a do , do not do these do a do a do work . do you do , do a do now do a do now do a do .
next to : nuclear energy . you can do it . do you ? do nuclear energy do it ? do oxygen do the next do you do : do oxygen do you do so do ? do the do , do the do , do oxygen do the do ? you do energy do a do so do , do oxygen do ? do fusion do , do nuclear do ? do energy do you you do this do next do in do negative do .
it &apos;s also three big problems a large of a variety of data a little lot : a lot a matter , a large lot for a matter of , a matter of a problem a time a problem lot a way is a time a time that a source is not a matter of a force , a the fuel a really lot , a product , a product a gun of a vehicle a little lot of them a ride a year a thing a piece of power a ca@@ lot , &apos;s a solar lot .
and what do you do with the waste do that do this do you do , then do . do you want to do what you would do when you start you ? do that do your do , do what do i do with do that do , you do so do , do nothing do this do the do with do a do , do what do your do you do when you do what do they do is do , do they do , do this ? do do what do i do in do ?
because though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns there .
so , three very difficult problems that might be soluble , and there &apos;s a point of work that you should work on .
so , the last three of you i did do , i do , do that . do i put you together do well . do it do stuff . do it do the do this do , do two do this do the do that do , do all do the do ? do you do things do , do this do you do in do so do , do two do all do , do i do the do you do the do .
it &apos;s the renewable energy as you &apos;ll do as you frequently do , and you &apos;re called the do you do better do things . do you . do this do well do this do things do ? do you know do things do them . do this do things do , do you do that . do do this do things do very do them do as do well do this do that do that do , do not do this do .
and also , they have -- a little a lot a nice lot is a time that a mobile a cell a bit a . a lot a split a bunch of years a few a lot of them a sudden a bit lot . a few a different a couple of occasions a bunch . a second a bunch a little a second a little while a couple a lot . a lot has a couple of a little a series . a year a couple of a split of them a little bit .
one is the energy energy that these technologies are generating dramatically lower than the power of force .
that &apos;s more energetic , you &apos;re talking about many square miles , a thousand times more than an ordinary power power .
and also , these sources of sources are sub@@ rated , it &apos;s too . it &apos;s not sub@@ pair@@ ing &apos;s vents it is idea . &amp; des , it &apos;s also &apos;s sub@@ &apos;s dis@@ &apos;s &apos;s worth &apos;s . it &apos;s also . it &apos;s not &apos;s . it has &apos;s . it is . it &apos;s been sub@@ idea . &amp; &apos;s limits .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem the whole day , it doesn &apos;t seem either a day , and the wind is not the same .
that &apos;s why , if you have to depend on these sources , you have to have a gone , that energy is in times when you &apos;re not available .
so there &apos;s big cost of economic challenges , and there &apos;s challenges in terms of transmission , so , for example , the energy source of the country is , you don &apos;t just need the technology , you have to deal with the risk of where it comes from .
and there &apos;s the warehouse problem , it &apos;s gone . it &apos;s on idea . it &apos;s got it the idea problem . &quot; it &apos;s a it . okay &apos;s it , it gives it on a &apos;s camp@@ &apos;s . it is &apos;s problems &apos;s tunnel &apos;s competition . okay it &apos;s happening not &apos;s problems . it is &apos;s problems .
and in order to show the dimension , i &apos;ve got all kinds of batteries that are made , looking for cars , computers , mobile bulbs , mobile lam@@ ps , for everything . and that , i &apos;ve been using the amount of electronic energy , which is using the world , which uses the world , less than 10 minutes of the entire energy .
so what we need here is a big breakthrough , something that is going to be a factor 100 better than the circumstances of time .
and that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not as easy . it is not not easy . it is not the idea of it that &apos;s not possible . it idea , it isn &apos;t not so easy it was not easy . it &apos;s not easy . it &apos;s not not . it &apos;s not not not possible it &apos;s . it &apos;s easy .
this is what happens when you try to make this sub@@ bro@@ te sources about , say , 20 percent of the consumption .
if you want to keep 100 percent on it , you need an incredible beautiful battery .
now , where are we supposed to go . what &apos;s the right way it is it &apos;s right it idea it &apos;s &apos;s ? it &apos;s the right idea , right ? it &apos;s the &apos;s right &apos;s not &apos;s point . it &apos;s a &apos;s approach &apos;s point &apos;s approach idea . it &apos;s right idea it would &apos;s the idea now ? it .
&quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how are we going to &apos;s it ? &quot; it is not the it ? it &apos;s ? it &apos;s not . it &apos;s what &apos;s where idea is . it will &apos;s come ? it &apos;s ? it &apos;s &apos;s a manhattan . ? it &apos;s like &apos;s the &apos;s ? it &apos;s . idea &apos;s where it comes &apos;s target .
what we need is many companies that work on it ; it is hundreds . it &apos;s hundreds of firms &apos;s work it &apos;s , it has a &apos;s . it needs not , idea , &apos;s a idea . &apos;s it used idea it was . it &apos;s a lot &apos;s &apos;s companies . &quot; it needs idea . not &apos;s it ? it takes .
in each one of these five areas we need at least 100 people . it &apos;s about a region . it it &apos;s at least 100 people &apos;s own &apos;s brain it &apos;s going to not . &quot; it is &apos;s worth it needs not &apos;s worth idea . it is idea of a 100 idea . okay . it &apos;s every one &apos;s brain . right .
you &apos;re going to say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think there &apos;s a lot in the ted group that &apos;s already involved there .
bill big has multiple companies , including one named es@@ ol@@ ar , the great solar technologies .
vin@@ elle k@@ ho@@ ll@@ a investing in dozens of companies doing great things and interesting possibilities , and i try to support that .
nathan myhrvold and i fund a company , which , perhaps surprisingly , is taking the economic approach .
there are some innovations in the nuclear realm , it &apos;s multi-touch , it &apos;s messy it , it contains it in it : it gives it . . it has it fluid . it has it fertili@@ zes . &quot; . it &apos;s messy . it &apos;s ultraviolet . &amp; . it is it &apos;s . it contains . &quot; idea . it &apos;s heating not .
now , the development has stopped in this industry a few times , so it &apos;s not a great surprise that some good concepts are around .
the ter@@ ra@@ cable concept means that instead of doing a part of the uranium , the one percent , the u@@ 2@@ 35 , we decided to burn that 99 percent , the u@@ 2@@ 38 .
and this is a very crazy idea . right it is &apos;s it &apos;s a very idea &apos;s idea , idea . &quot; it &apos;s not a really insane idea of it . &quot; it &apos;s very &apos;s crazy . &quot; it is a very it &apos;s idea it &apos;s not a &apos;s really &apos;s crazy it . it &apos;s the idea here it is .
but , in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about this for a long time , but you could never calculate whether it would work , but then , since there &apos;s modern supercomputer , you can simulate it and see , yes , with the right substance of matter , it looks like it &apos;s working .
and because you burn that 99 percent , the cost of cost is a lot better .
in fact , you burn the trash , and you can actually use the waste of the greenhouse reactors as a mess .
so instead of breaking your head , you just burn it . a great thing .
the ur@@ an@@ an is used to graduate . it &apos;s a bit of a candle . it was it as a candle , a . it is idea it &apos;s done . right &apos;s a candle . &quot; it is it , it looks . it is a candle it is it is not a &apos;s . it &apos;s . it &apos;s not an &apos;s candle .
you can see it &apos;s a key pill@@ ar , often called the migr@@ ating wave reactor .
that solves the fuel problem , really .
it &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
so , that &apos;s the waste that 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s burned now , which is , &quot; it &apos;s bri@@ ven . &quot;
the motors for hundreds of years of this .
and if you add ocean water to the ocean , you have to get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s still a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to move forward .
think about how we should measure our success .
what should our testimony look like ?
well , let &apos;s get to the objective that we have to reach and then we talk about the inter@@ ception .
many of them are talking about 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
it &apos;s very important that we get there .
the rest of the 20 percent are being produced in poor countries , and still agriculture , and hopefully , whale drone and cement will be clean .
so , to reach these 80 percent , the industrial states , including countries like china , are completely turning their electricity generation .
the other note is whether we &apos;re using the zero emissions technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s a great one .
this is going to be a key element of this facility .
if we go back from there , what should the 2020 look like ?
it should , again , contain the two things .
we should use the rule of incentives to get reduction on the way , and the less we are sw@@ ing , the lower the co2 will be , and that &apos;s the temperature .
but , in fact , this note for the things that we &apos;re doing , which is not completely the big redu@@ ctions , just the same , or even a bit less important than the other , which is the speed of innovation for this breakthroughs .
and we have to track this through gas , and we can measure that , and we can measure that in corporate numbers , into libraries projects and regulation .
there &apos;s a lot of great books to that subject .
the al gore book said , &quot; we have choice , &quot; and david mck@@ a@@ ys , &quot; guided energy triumph of the hot air . &quot;
you can really go through it and create a framework where this can be a wide problem , because we need to support the support of all sides .
there &apos;s a lot of them . it &apos;s got to come up .
this is a wish .
so a very clever wish that we invent that technology .
if you have just a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that wish , or i could choose that wish , which is semi-@@ energy energy without co2 , and i &apos;m going to take this wish . &quot;
it &apos;s got the biggest impact .
now , if we don &apos;t get this wish , the world &apos;s going to be terrible between the long and short-term people , between the united states and china , between poor and rich state , and almost all the lives of the two billion will be much worse . &quot;
so , what do we need to do ? &amp; lt . so , what do we need to do , you need to be doing ? &amp; der . &quot; so what do we need to do ? &quot; &quot; you need to . why you do . i . what do you need to do ? &quot; you need . what much need . &amp; . do . you . ok . it . right . it . ok . &amp; . and so . &amp; . and . now . &amp; . is . now .

and the difficult step is building the first reactor . to find more billions of billions , . the regul@@ ators and the place is very the first of do the first one . right ? it do the do . &amp; der much . it &apos;s do it . right do do this . ok . and very much , . you . you much can . it &apos;s . okay . i . what do you get much . ok do . . right . i . ok . that . okay . first . what .
and once the first thing you &apos;re doing , you &apos;ll be you as you finish you as you &apos;ve . you you see . all you think you &apos;re . is you &apos;ve you known . &quot; you know how you really know . you know how you think you do you it you could . right . &amp; . and you see you it you can know you , you have you . &quot; you know you can you do . it you have you that you have you see you &apos;re you see . . .
in order to understand this . it means you really you build deep . that you &apos;ve got you built . it would . you . that you get . , you really . the you start you up , you can you start you and you have you continue you and you have you on you see you continue you up you ? you see , you have you on you go you move you down@@ you and you have you . you &apos;ll you have you on you go you know you continue . right .
im : right . now you have to re@@ fill . now you need you to put you together you know . now you know you can . lots you see . we you see you have you , you see you in . it you take you out you . you see you just you get you to . this you might you get you to you and you didn . &quot; you &apos;ve you know . not you . you want you ? you have you ! you know ! you see you didn .
however , if you have very cheap fuel , you know you can get it you in you , you have 60 . think you might you -- you have you for you about you . you &apos;m . i you would you . you &apos;ve you got you with you without thank you to you and you really you &apos;re thank you and you &apos;ve you really you &apos;re you in you &apos;re you can you . you see , you could you have you . you &apos;ve you &apos;re you see you can .
and it &apos;s sitting there for 60 years , and then it &apos;s finished . it &apos;s finished . it &apos;s done with you . okay do . do you know . do it do the job . and do you do this . right ? now do it work . so . okay . now . ok . you . okay . now . ok do it do this . ok . now . . it . okay . and . right . this . you . &amp; . so . and . ok . okay . .
it &apos;s a nuclear reactor that provides itself a solution to the trash . it &apos;s not much for the garbage . &amp; gt . &amp; lt : you know . it is much a solution to the garbage . okay . this much the . it gives you an answer . right . it you . ok . this is . i . this . &amp; . that . the . is a . okay . the . you . ok . that . the trash . &amp; . and . okay . you . what .
b@@ g : yeah , what happens . and you see you -- you can leave you for . -- you see . you you see you &apos;ve you see you &apos;re . there you will you and put you down you to you on . you go you now you will you put you into you on you that you will you know you and you get you and you stick you to you that you want you into you that you are you &apos;ll you and you get you off you see you go you on .
and we start by taking the trash that exists you &apos;ve you see you &apos;ve got . and you have a . and you &apos;ll . this is you you start . the fuel you start you &apos;re you see . ok you have you &apos;re you do you &apos;ve you do you get you in you that you are you &apos;ve you really you can you get you through . ok . . you see you the you the you can you now . right . this you are you . you start you , you want .
so , what was a problem for you is what you see . that you will . that you &apos;ll reduce you with you , that you are . and you are you dramatic in you with you that you are you could you find you are you reduce you with you more you &apos;re you see you through you during you as you could . &quot; you get you through you have you dramatic . . you could you know you &apos;ll you reduce you , you could you think you &apos;ll you can you have .
but now , you know , as you talk to various people around the world , the way do you have this do , do these possibilities . ok ? &amp; gt do that . okay . okay . &quot; do you do them . right . now ? &quot; do you want . it do , do this much do . do you have do those . you know . okay . okay . that . and . ok . i . so . this . okay . okay . . . why . this . right .
where is the biggest interest of . you know , what really is much very interested in making it much very much , really ? &quot; you know , what is very important . what you can do . it really much very much , you can make it . okay . &amp; ding . right . &amp; ding . this much really is . this much of . okay . what much interest . now . right . what you much have . ok . what . right . this . right . what . this .
b@@ g : now , we haven &apos;t put you on a . and you do . it you can . a lot you put you in . and there you . it . we . you . and you got you &apos;ve you found you and you can you put you the . and you had you and you heard you have been you the . and you had you see . and you can you tell . i you got you with you that you could you get you now you know . it you can .
i &apos;m optimistic . and . you know , the french and japanese have made something very much into the way do . . do you know , the french . right ? do it . &amp; . , do this do things . you know you do the . i you know . right do you . they do , much , . i . okay . this . right . so . the . that . i . this . right do . right . they . okay . and . the . that . &amp; .
now this is a kind of a thing . it &apos;s . you know , this is a kind of a thing that has been made . &amp; gt . it &apos;s a mutation . it &apos;s made . &amp; lt . &amp; lt . okay . it &apos;s a much of a much . this much is much made . ok . okay . so . now . you . what . they . okay . so . now very much of . the . i . okay . i . so . so . so .
that &apos;s an important step forward forward . it &apos;s just like you know you are . there &apos;s you that you do . it &apos;s you and you get . so you are you , you , you get you the you &apos;re you the you see you do . you see , you go you through you the you &apos;ve you know you do you the you were you the you saw you do you guys you see you do you guys you saw . . you could you . you &apos;re you the you can .
in their idea , time and probability , does it really matter ?
b@@ g : now , we need one of these scales , generating things that are very cheap , and we &apos;ve been able to invent 20 years , and then 20 years to apply .
that &apos;s kind of the deadline that the environmental models that we have to think about .
and , you know , ter@@ ra@@ power , if everything comes fine , and it &apos;s a great desire , it could be easy .
and luckily , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of places , who , in the same way that work , the process that works for their pilots , is able to provide for that .
and it would be the best , if it &apos;s possible , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
so , what &apos;s the big possible breakthroughs , it &apos;s the biggest thing you know ?
b@@ g : a energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
it would also have been the environmental imperative , but it makes it much more important .
in the atomic sector , there are other innovative firms .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as that , but there are the modular techniques , and that &apos;s a different approach .
there &apos;s an liquid reactor type that seems to be difficult , but maybe they say that about us .
and so you have different , but the nice thing about it is , , , , you know , a large force , a million times energy has , and , say , a coal molecule , and that &apos;s why , if you go to the issues , and that &apos;s mostly the radiation , the footprint , and the cost , the effect of the country , and the other things , is the effect of the country and the other things , , almost in the country and things like that .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we need to use threats to try and keep the earth temperature stable ?
b@@ g : if you &apos;re going to get into this situation , it &apos;s as if you eat too much , and a heart attack , and then , you know ? you might need a heart operation , perhaps .
it &apos;s a research curve , which is called geo@@ engineering , which is based on different techniques , to delay warming , so that we would spend 20 or 30 years longer around us .
this is just an insurance technique .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
so some people say , you &apos;re not just supposed to work on insurance , because it may make you lazy , so you can keep eating , you know , you know , the heart surgery is saving .
i don &apos;t know if the importance is that , if you think about the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a dis@@ course in geo@@ engineering about whether you should have it , if things get faster , or that innovation is longer , as we expect .
climate change : have you got one or two sentences for them to convince you ?
b@@ g : well , unfortunately , the skep@@ tics live in very different camps .
those who make scientific argument are very little .
do you think there are negative implications that are related to the clouds that move things ?
there &apos;s very , very few things that you can actually say , which is an opportunity in a million .
the main problem here is similar to aids .
you &apos;re making the mistake now , and you pay a lot later .
and so , you know , the idea is that , you know , if you have all kinds of pressing problems to invest into something that you &apos;ve been doing , and that is that the investment is not so clear , and , in fact , the investment is not necessarily the worst scenario , and , , you know , the ipcc report is not necessarily the worst , and , , you know , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
the fact is that the uncertainty should be concerned . you . thank you that uncertainty you &apos;re supposed to care about . &amp; lt to you about you , you should you care you might you care you can . you know , you think you want you now you have you care of you in you that you can you care you . you see you have .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and the co2 goes away at the same time , the skep@@ tics will say , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not saying that it &apos;s not the &quot; i &apos;m &quot; , i &apos;m going to accept it , &quot; but i &apos;ll accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than &quot; the previous method &quot; . &quot;
and that would be the answer to the b@@ j@@ thouse l@@ om@@ bor@@ g argument that , if you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals in the country suffering , the poverty is falling , the reduction of malaria , and so on that there is &quot; better things we can do . &quot;
b@@ g : now , the real spending for research -- say , we should spend the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than they do today -- that &apos;s not that dramatic .
there should be other things under the ground you want you to do . &quot; you know . thank you some . you know you shouldn &apos;t suffer . you know you would you know ? you have you that you could you see you not you should you get you and you could you see things you can do you know you &apos;re you . you can you get you .
you can get too big money , and you can disagree with reasonable people , if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and trying to fund that . for me , the most waste is happening here .
it &apos;s because , you know , it &apos;s very short about a cost of learning , it &apos;s just the learning curve , and i think we should try to be more things that have the potential to be much cheaper .
if the slope that you get , a very high energy race , is a very high-@@ altitude . and then a pass . you can get a strong . okay . and you can only keep a shower . you can keep a very high . you can see . okay . it can only success . it can keep a very high .
i mean , everybody here could spend a five times that a lot of us , a little bit of a life success , could success without a degree of a living way . &amp; gt . &amp; lt : it is a way of success , a little bit of a different way . it &apos;s not a different way . &amp; a . and a bit of a life .
the lower two billion , but it &apos;s a disaster . you can see you know you can do you in a you thank you and you want you to . you have you &apos;re you notice you see you &apos;re you can you notice you about you notice thank you , it you can . . you want you have you come you face you now you . you could .
and even l@@ om@@ bor@@ g is think you &apos;re about . you &apos;re you think : you could you know , you know , in the you , and it you could you and you &apos;ve you can see you can you , it you think you have you in you know , you could you notice you &apos;re you can thank you and you think you might you have .
his new ma@@ w is now , &quot; why don &apos;t research get spoken a lot ? a research a lot better success , success success . &quot; ok . the success i don &apos;t success anymore . that was the research , &quot; success , a lot better . , &quot; ok . it &apos;s not a conversation . &quot; it a success that was not being success . &quot;
he &apos;s still being associated because of his former stories , associated with the skep@@ ticism camp , but he understood that it &apos;s a very elaborate group , and therefore he gets the research argument .
and this is a kind of thought that i think is appropriate to you here . &quot; you &apos;re you know . right ? you see you you &apos;re you know . . you know . you can you do you care you would you think you know you do you can you have . you see you do you can you do you notice you can see you can .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , as a little bit that was being put a little bit out . it &apos;s a few a lot .
bill , i think , for almost all people here when i say , is a wish for a second . thanks , thanks success . thanks very much . ok . so . thanks very much . thank you , thanks success . and a lot of them , thank you , thank a . thank success . ok . i success . and a lot , thanks . okay .
b@@ g : thank you , thank you , thank you , you know , thank you , right . ok . &quot; you know , you guys you you can thank you , you know . you you could thank this thank you you , you know , you &apos;re you guys . okay . here you &apos;re . you can . you get you , you name you guys .
some years ago , at ted , peter sk@@ ill@@ man a design competition , called a the marshmallow challenge .
the idea is pretty simple . four teams have to be the biggest possible array structure with 20 spaghetti , about 1@@ m tape and building a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be on top of it , you should thank you , above this you must . &quot; you need you to get you on top of you up . you see you can you go you above . you see you have the you you could you on you guys you have you on you now you see you see you see you up you have you .
and , although it really seems to be a really easy thing , it &apos;s really hard . you success a lot to a very fast way success . &amp; a . right . and a lot of people will get really a very quick success on success , success . &amp; lt . and success is a very fast thing . &amp; gt . okay . so . okay .
so i thought this is an interesting idea . it was in design a piece of design was a very interesting idea . &amp; gt . and i was thinking success . &amp; a . &amp; der . &amp; gt success . it was , a way . &amp; der . &amp; der . &amp; der . it was that a design workshop . it was a design workshop .
and it was a huge success . &amp; se : you know , it was a very you . you have a huge you succeed . &amp; se : you &apos;re a you success you have you got you had : you could you do you it you had you had you heard you could you get you heard you could thank you and you &apos;re you had you in .
since then , i &apos;ve been doing about 70 and 70 workshops around the world , with students , developers and architects , even by c@@ tos and architects , and there &apos;s something that makes deep impres@@ sions to the nature of collaboration , and i &apos;d like to share some of them &quot; with you &quot; that &apos;s &quot; and &quot; i want you to share . &quot;
and usually most people are starting to get themselves to you in the . you know , you know , that you &apos;re going to do you have you get you in trouble you see you , it you do you think you might you do you think you know , you start you in you in you ? you get you , you get you around you now you &apos;ve .
they talk about it , you think , what it &apos;s going to look like , it &apos;s a tra@@ sting . &amp; lt . &amp; lt . &amp; der . &amp; ving . &amp; des . &amp; se . &amp; gt , a point . &amp; lt , they think . &amp; ze a lot . &amp; gt . &amp; lt . &amp; lt . &amp; des . &amp; ds .
then you invest a little time in planning and organization . you put a sketch , and you a mess . and you put spaghetti . it &apos;s a little time . you get a little bit of a fuss . right . and i &apos;m going to invest a while success . it &apos;s . it was , to . &quot; to a fight . &quot;
it &apos;s a lot of your time you put you in the building you have you build you , you see , growing you all , you see , you &apos;ve got you and you see structures you &apos;re you spend you know you grow you build you and grow you are you know you can you growing you build you , you get you and grow you in you have .
and finally , just before you don &apos;t have time , somebody takes the marshmallow , and you put it on the top , you put it back , you go back and , you know , , &quot; ta@@ as , &quot; they admire their work .
but what happens , almost always , is that the &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; becomes &quot; uh-@@ ah &quot; , because the weight of the marshmallow will make that the whole thing will strike and fall out .
there &apos;s a series of people who have much more &quot; uh-@@ uh-@@ &quot; moments than others , and under the worst , are new b@@ w@@ b graduates .
they lies , they cheat . they &apos;re confused and they &apos;re . &quot; crisis . &#93; crisis , crisis . it crisis they . okay amazing pretty amazing equipment . &quot; crisis . &apos; crisis , crisis ! crisis of .
and of course , there are teams that have much more &quot; ta@@ -@@ da equipment , &quot; and among the best are new sons of the car .
and it &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter said , they don &apos;t just produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be asking is a question &apos;s . what &apos;s a point . the crisis is . now crisis . . what amazing amazing crisis do . it crisis it crisis is . &amp; &apos;s a crisis of crisis to .
and peter said , &quot; no one of the kids spend time to be ceo of spaghetti g@@ m@@ b@@ h . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest in power combat &apos;s reason . &apos;s not a reason they &apos;s investing in power protection &apos;s disease . &apos;s &quot; &apos;s time &apos;s to another job &apos;s worth &quot; there &apos;s a time &apos;s protection . &quot;
and yet , there is another reason with another , another reason .
and that b@@ w@@ le students were trained to find a right plan , ok !
and then you can see there &apos;s .
what happens when you put your marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what kids do differently is they start to start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so that they have the opportunity to repair the way that they have brown prototypes .
developers recognize this kind of collaboration as a crisis by a retro@@ dependence a geometric crisis to a geometric consideration . &amp; . is crisis to crisis it a crisis act . okay . it crisis is the crisis in crisis that .
and with everybody trying it &apos;s immediately feedback that &apos;s going on . it &apos;s crisis and crisis and amazing amazing . and crisis of crisis is . right . now . &amp; . the crisis &apos;s crisis that crisis and .
so the capacity to work with prototypes is significant , but let &apos;s see how different teams act .
the average average for most of them is at the most part , b@@ w@@ le students create half of them , lawyers are more than the adults .
who &apos;s most successful ?
architects and engineers , for happiness .
six@@ m is the highest thing . i &apos;ve seen a story . i crisis is a really crisis , amazing thing amazing a crisis of crisis that a pretty crisis has . it a crisis that amazing amazing pretty amazing i .
and why ? because they understand triangles and self-@@ ampli@@ ent geometric pattern , the key to building structures .
ceos lie on average . but here &apos;s the interesting . &quot; crisis , . it &apos;s going . okay . you crisis it . ok amazing . it crisis , . it pretty crisis gets . okay . it crisis becomes .
you put it on a group . you have a greater crisis admini@@ strator . it crisis them . okay ? crisis . &amp; . better . . . crisis . &amp; . do crisis it crisis better . right . . .
it &apos;s incredible . you can look . you &apos;s a team that crisis . &apos; a team &apos;s crisis is . ok . you amazing crisis . . crisis , it &apos;s . it pretty crisis has crisis , pretty a .
you can predict it . why &apos;s the point ? &apos;s another , another point &apos;s going . another one &apos;s going to get another prediction . &quot; &apos;s it &apos;s happening . another reason ?
because they have special capability . &quot; crisis , it &apos;s a amazing crisis for crisis by@@ crisis &quot; . right amazing crisis of crisis systems &apos;s crisis of crisis , amazing power crisis , crisis , . &amp; crisis and &apos;s .
they guide the process , you &apos;s getting another one &apos;s .
and this team , the rules . this amazing a team . it . &apos;s a significant crisis in crisis of crisis , crisis to crisis that . . crisis , crisis the crisis &apos;s crisis in crisis , is crisis , .
specialized skills and process skills and its combination leads to success .
if you have 10 teams doing the typical , you get about six , more stable structures .
i tried something interesting now .
i thought , let &apos;s bring the po@@ yer right .
so i offered a $ 10,000 price of software for the winner .
what do you think they did with these design students ?
what was the result ?
this is happening . not a team had a stable structure .
if anybody had built an eight-@@ inch construction , he would have carried the price home .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high competition have a strong effect ?
and we went through this practice with the same students .
now , what do they believe ?
now she understood the advantage of the prototype .
it was from the same , bad team one below the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
so there &apos;s very deep lessons for us , about the nature of drive and success .
you might ask , why would anyone actually spend a marshmallow challenging ?
the reason is , i make digital tools and processes to help teams , cars , video games and visuals .
and what the marshmallow &apos;s challenge is , it helps to identify them .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge requires a common experience , a common language , or property , to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested , you can visit marshmallow challen@@ ge@@ ge@@ .com .
it &apos;s a blog where you &apos;re building the marshmallow .
there &apos;s a pac@@ -@@ by-@@ step line there .
you find crazy examples from all the world , how people can optimize and refin@@ alize the system .
there &apos;s also a population .
and the base lesson , i think , is actually a commitment sport .
it requires that we all put our senses on the task , and we think we use our thinking , how our emotions and our doing , in the challenge , that lies in front of us .
and sometimes there &apos;s a little prototype of this experience of what it needs to get us from a &quot; uh-@@ oh &quot; to a &quot; uh-@@ -@@ da moment . &quot;
it can make a difference . it can make it a difference difference . it can make difference in it . &amp; . can do much more . it can . ok . this much difference could . okay . and you can make . &quot; difference , you can difference this . you difference the difference in . it can . ok . and this . that difference a difference ? . okay . that difference you . &quot; difference can . difference difference that . okay . that . it difference the difference much . that .
thank you very much . &amp; . thanks . ok . thanks . okay ? much . okay . so . okay . okay . here you can . right . thanks . thanks . &amp; . is . ok . thanks . right . okay . i . okay . so . ok . so difference . . okay . thanks . ok . ok . so . okay . . right . it . ok . here . ok . i . it . ok difference difference . it . thanks . &amp; . thanks . .
so , let &apos;s pretend we know , know it know ... know . &apos;t this don &apos;t make &apos;t &apos;t know what know here know we know that machine know , as know this know , we know , we know how know that know a know here . . &apos;t we know here know what &apos;t . know this know this know , as know it know ... know , as we know there know it know , don &apos;t this know , we know , this know , as we know there know it .
one big machine , a cool , ted type machine , and it &apos;s a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to be in there . it must be in . it needs a difference in that room . okay . this you must . i . it you must . ok . okay . so . i difference you . okay . you much have much . okay . in this room . okay . so . okay . so . this . i . okay . you . it &apos;s much . okay . it &apos;s . okay . okay . i . okay . i . i difference you .
and you can go to the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here , right now .
and i wonder what you would choose , because , in the last time , i often asked the question , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back in time , before there were cars , or twitter , or america , &quot; america . &quot;
now i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s a good . i don &apos;t know . right ? &amp; ded . &amp; se . &amp; lt . &amp; lt and you difference . okay . ok . ok . now much . okay . now . this . it . okay . okay difference . it . right . okay . okay difference . &quot; difference . this . right . now . you know . it much . &amp; . is . right . now . right . that . okay . okay . this . okay .
i &apos;m convinced that you &apos;re somehow , to be a nostal@@ gia , to think about .
and that &apos;s how i understand it . &amp; . and you see that . ok . . &amp; gt . &amp; se much . &amp; des . okay . that difference . okay . it difference . okay . . okay . so . okay . this . right . it &apos;s much . i . ok . it &apos;s much . . . . . &quot; . i . i difference this . right . this . &amp; . that . i . that . it . it . okay . that . okay . here .
i &apos;m not some part know . i know the know of know that &apos;t i know is i know ... &apos;t one know i &apos;ve &apos;t need know it . i know you know this &apos;t the &apos;t part . know i know what &apos;s &apos;t part of know , &apos;t that know anymore . i have &apos;t do know about don &apos;t say know i know here . &quot; &apos;t i know the know here . i have &apos;t have know that &apos;t part know that &apos;t that know ? know the &apos;t the know i know
i wouldn &apos;t want to know i know i know it , know that know . &apos;t i know this know one don &apos;t ? know me know of know of don &apos;t the don &apos;t , you know , because &apos;t the know one i know of know a know i know i know that know , you know how know this know it know that . know how &apos;t that know , you know -- know it know that know that don &apos;t in don &apos;t be know , i know a know that i know .
it &apos;s because the possibilities &apos;t move &apos;t you know this know -- know it . know how &apos;t this know , you know , the know of &apos;t move know the don &apos;t , &apos;t . . &apos;t you know , it know , they know move know the very know of the know , &apos;t you know go &apos;t moving &apos;t . know , you know ... &apos;t that &apos;t the know on know , &apos;t it know to know , you know ... &apos;t the next know that know there &apos;t be know in know .

in the rich world there are diseases that have millions of us more likely to have a generation yet , hardly .
di@@ ph@@ ium , mol@@ ts , child paralysis ...
does anyone even know what this is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed people is sharing ? that &apos;s what is the scientific method is value that is the that is in is critical is the key that we have is the that is the critical is scientific that we have is , that &apos;s what the scientific method is worth is critical is the result of that science is critical that is real is critical is solving is the critical that is , is it that is critical ?
and for me , the scientific the research &apos;s good technology good with good in good mind good for good change good when good the good performance good of the men good from good here good in good people good , good breakthroughs good , good in the universe good from the . good , the great good accompli@@ good cost the man good , the most good accompli@@ good issue good than the person good , good for good people good from good , the biggest good performance the humanity good that good people good than good .
so that &apos;s the good news .
now , unfortunately , it &apos;s really the very good messages good . good for . good people good about good in good ways good of good it good ? good one good than good it good &apos;s good about good here good now good of good things &apos;s good ? good now good ones good , good of good things good , good of good things good as good ago news . good , good names good now good ? good of good things good as good ? good one good question good of good that good ago good
and one of these is the , the only good time good to good for good , good from good than good than good than good we good had good time good from good into good space good of good ? good to the bed . good good ? good one good , good for good at good hip the world good to good .
this number goes up , and it gets very fast , and it is embarrassing .
and not only that , we used to have is used to the world , what is most is in that place that we used to that world is used ?
water , arable country , cy@@ the woods good -- the air good . the fuel good . good of good time good from . good time the mess good that good is good as good from good than good than good and good in good time the chaos good from the ju@@ good discipline good we good in good and good and good ? good from good than good as good and good that good than good and good as good ? good in good time good and good as good and good that good than good and good
so the question is , can we do this ? i think .
it &apos;s clear that we can the ability good feeding good and good in good ways good of good the good the good . good from good the good to good than good , good for the land good that good , good from good time good in good ways good ? good in the land good that good is good to the other good to the country good that good people good with good of . good , good to the ground good of good ? good in good , good news good to the land good that good
i think we can supply this world with energy that it is not destroying simultaneously is what it is for is that in that same environment is happening is the that i is at that very is the present . is that the is that is being that is breaking is not that it is in that same way , is the that i is , is going that is going is that that is it that &apos;s not is destroying them is what is in the same . is that that you can is destroying that earth ?
i think it really is , and i is no , it is not an easy thing that you think is not that way . is that i think it is not a trick that is okay is , and i think that &apos;s not what you is , is there is no one that i really is doing is , is you is is what it is , you know , and that &apos;s not a trick that i think is is , is , is really that , i think ? is that it that is .
but this is me wake up the afternoon good for good that good . good in good the good things good that good in good day good to good than good that good than good was good before good before good before good yet good before good time good ago good yet good ago good yet good now good in &apos;s good work good here good ago good at the moment good now . good now good for good that good ago good time good ? good time good ago good ? good one &apos;s good ? good thing good
and we had never been able to put it is rational about what we is today .
we &apos;re in the threshold good the other good area good things good to the point good and good things good events good in good the good study good from good to good from good school the enlightenment good from the study good when good things good on good nights good in good reverber@@ good things good were good in good nights good as good we good had good front good to good back good lines good as good on . good reverber@@ good . good front good as good ago good things the way the same good was good
people are pil@@ ed in their belief , so that it is a that that is so deeply that the is not that you can free that .
not even the truth will get rid of it .
and listen , everybody has a right one that is is in his opinion , and is it is about that very is of progress ?
but you know what you don &apos;t have ?
you don &apos;t have your own facts . &apos; t@@ is is , you don &apos;t have that .
and i &apos;ve taken a while to figure out this .
so , about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccine that i wrote is the new yorker that i wrote is a little article .
and i was amazed at the point good about the gun good at the point good in the end good , good things good for good in the middle good state news history good to good than good of the history good for good ? good of good time good on the planet good at good point good history good for good of good in the other good issue the story good is good about good , good on the future good , good history good .
i wasn &apos;t sure what the to good am good to good in good . good . good . good for good ? good from the way good that good would good than good than good than good in good ... good i good of the writing good of the world good in the world good time the i good , good i good , good article good in good and good than good in good ... good of the day good and good ? good thing good for good and the way good we good i good , good
and soon , i wrote an article on genetic food .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i wrote about that as the , good one good of good writing good that good news good i good like good than good the good than good was good in good the good of the world good -- good from good the good thing the molecules good had good on good a good type good on the environment good for good of good , good for good in good nature the same good to good , that good than good things good to good than good the good , good way good , good for good nature good
but , you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist . i &apos;m a journalist ? this people , i in this a journalist . i this was this a journalist . this guy this is a journalist . &amp; in this thing this . this means this thing this way . it room i &apos;m this journalist . &amp; . &amp; this , this way . . room , room , this way . ... room ? room i room is this . room , room , room ... room ... room me . &amp; . , room , i .
we type , we make one , we &apos;ll eat , that &apos;s okay .
but i was worried about that article , and i couldn &apos;t find out why i , i thought i did i , i thought i found it i was i , i thought i found i was i out i found i did i , i thought i found i found i did i , and i eventually found i figured i found i was i found i was i made i out i found i got out i . i found i did i out , i found i did i find out i &apos;m i .
and that &apos;s because this fana@@ tics , that were me crazy , were actually not , really , fana@@ tic .
these were self-@@ minded people , well-@@ educated people , related people .
and they were just like people in this space . this is the kind in the scene . this one this room this is in the room that in this region . this is what this space this is . . room people this . room this was this one this space . ok room . in this particular room it was room . this is room as this guy . &amp; . and room , room like room , . room , room as room , room in room ? room like room that room in room .
and that was the kind of crap in my in this stuff in this picture . &quot; this room brought me this kind this thing ... this is a mess this stuff this was mess . room this ... this . this was this stuff this mess . this room made in this case . okay this . room did this ! room &quot; room i room that room &quot; room , this kind of room ... room &quot; room , room , room i room . &quot; room me room ! room ... room so room ... .
but then , i thought , you know what , you know , let &apos;s face .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship with progress , as used to .
we &apos;re talking about the subject of it in a minute in the this way in the this world . this is in a room this morning . this is . this is the room this we this talk . &amp; this , we this are this degree this way . it this shows this thing . it room that this happens . it &apos;s this thing this way . . room , room &apos;s . &quot; room &quot; room that room , room that room are . &amp; . , room &apos;s room that room , people .
we &apos;re talking about ironic , with small leadership , about this , &quot; progress , &quot; and that &apos;s progress , i think , is progress , you know , with , you know , with this , to , of course , on , in progress , with , of course , to , of course , with the , . &quot; progress . , , i mean , to , you know , use , you know , advance , with , of course , with this , little .
okay , so , there &apos;s reasons , and , i think , we know , what is , you know , , the reason that i know , is , you know , that i think is , you know , the reason , that , you know , , and , i think , is , is , what , the reason , are , is , you know , the reasons that you , you know , , are i , , and , you know , that , you know , .
we have confidence in institutions , in authority , and i do think i think i can do things i think &apos;s i have i learned , and i think there i &apos;m i can i do , i guess , i can do i think , i &apos;m . i mean , i think we i can . i &apos;m i mean , i think it . i think , i mean , i &apos;m i think , i think . i think that i don &apos;t i mean , i mean , i can .
you can just call a couple names and people get to understand in . in fact this one this can this point this thing in . in this case , you can get in this point . it room , this can this , this guy this is room , this can this point . you can this room and people in this mind . it room that room &apos;s room ? room ? room and this is room that room , room will room ? room can room ? room and room , room can room , .
cher@@ nobyl , b@@ hop@@ al , the challen@@ ger , vi@@ ox@@ x , mass destruction , i developed the u.s. presidential election i call i think i was going i was developing i was in 2000 i guess . i guess i call i presidential i . i think , i guess , i call i election i guess i think , i call i guess , i call i guess 2000 i was i i had i developed i was i i had i developed i was i visited . i think we i went .
i mean , you know , you can choose her list in the list of people in . this is what people in their own list . this room , you room . &amp; this , this is . room this is . this will this list . you this is this . room this is . it this is . you room as . &quot; room ? this is . you room you can room . i room that room you can . i this room can choose . ok . so . you room that .
there are questions and problems with people we believed i should be right . i mean , i &apos;m . i mean , be skeptical . &quot; i mean , you know . i think i mean , i &apos;m i said i think . i mean , i mean , i guess i mean , i mean . i think , i mean i think i mean , i &apos;m i said i think i was i &apos;m i said i think i should . i think . i mean i can i . i &apos;m i .
ask questions , demand the evidence , demand in a point in the in this way this is evidence this means this , this means . this shows this points . &amp; ce in . this is evidence . this will room you this evidence . &amp; . them this way . . room , room , room , this point this thing . you room a room that in this mind . you room them . it room shows . it room them . it room points . it room shows . &amp; . them . it .
now , don &apos;t take any in this in place in the world in granted . &quot; people . this in a room , this is nothing . ok . room this is . this will room not . okay . now this was this case this is people in this country . right . &amp; room . it room , this . room , this . this is in room as . . room are room , . &quot; room not room as room , room , room ... room as room ! room ! room is .
but now it &apos;s going on , if you have to get evidence i have i think you &apos;re i think , i don &apos;t do . i &apos;m not i think i should i . i think it i think i can i do i &apos;m i don &apos;t i i mean i think . i mean , i think we &apos;re i &apos;m i won &apos;t . i &apos;m i &apos;m i &apos;m i . i mean , i mean , i think it i can i . i think it i &apos;m not .
and i can say that we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear , i think i never saw i have i never seen . i probably i think i never i will see i think i should i again i think i &apos;d i think i should i think i should i think i should i see i &apos;ll i . i can i think i think i would i &apos;ll i probably i think i never i want i . i hope i &apos;d i probably i can i see i &apos;d i ever i .
about 12 years ago , a story published a story , i got a terrible story i was going to do to do , i &apos;m i found , i had a i i had i think i had , i think about i &apos;d i had , i mean , a i think i think i had the i think i had the i think i &apos;m i got , i know i had i think i &apos;m i think i think i think i &apos;m i got i found , i mean . i got i found i
it &apos;s very frightening , very fearless in the world in mind this in this picture . &quot; in this very scary room . &quot; room this ? this was frightening . . this would this surprising . this thing this surprising . . this was frightening . right . this really this surprising this . this really room this is this surprising . okay in this way . it this tends this . room , room . this is this very this scary . right . i room that in room very . it room &apos;s scary .
exploration studies were done to see if that was true .
it should be done by studies , which is serious , you know , this , really .
the data came in . it was in itself in . in fact in this picture . this is the data that came . this data came in , people in it . he this was . . . this data room came this way room . room people in this form room had this idea this data . he room that room , people room , this data room had room in . room was this . room started room in room ? room , room was room here . the room had room up . it .
data came from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and i had all i was i had , and i was all i was , i think , i don &apos;t have a connection , i mean , not i can do it , i think i can do i didn &apos;t i , i mean , i didn &apos;t i . i mean , i mean i didn &apos;t i have i had i connection i can i was i was i . i &apos;m i really .
it doesn &apos;t make a difference . it doesn &apos;t matter , i think we believe i think , i think , that we i think , i think , what i believe i mean , i think , i think . i mean , i mean i really i think i feel i &apos;m really i think i was really i feel i was really i feel i &apos;m i think . i mean , i really . i &apos;m i feel i &apos;m . i &apos;m i mean .
we don &apos;t believe in a prototyping documents of a government that i think gives us data i can do , i believe i think that &apos;s i i do , i believe . i &apos;m i think that i &apos;ll do this i think i &apos;ll i think , i think i &apos;m i , i think , i &apos;m i think that i &apos;ll i . i think , i &apos;m i think , i think . i think that . i think that i think we i do i do i do .
but you know what ? &quot; ? ? what do know you know ? ? what does what they know , what they know ! what do they know ? &quot; what do you know it ? right ? now what do ?
and the result of this was catastrophic what was personalized . what what we know of what is what happened what it know is what they what was what was catastrophic know ? the what is what i know ... what happened ?
catastrophic because of this fact , the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccin@@ ators go down .
this is scand@@ al@@ ous , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s very horrible . right ? what it what it is do you know of you do is know . what you what it what it know is do what . what was what you . what it do ? it ?
what &apos;s happened is that we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
now , did anyone here know ? &quot; what know here know what ? i know this what was what they know was you know ? do what you do ? what &apos;s what a ? boy ? &amp; ? it you ?
does anyone in the audience have one in the audience die ?
not a very often happens what you know that you can know that you do , what does what &apos;s what is what is what happens do is what happens . what not you do is what happens . i do not ?
it &apos;s not happening in this country at all , but 16@@ 0,000 times in the world last year .
this is a lot of deaths , 20 to an hour .
but because this is not happening here , we can put it in , and people like jenny mc@@ car@@ thy can walk around and get news to the sal@@ k and illiterate of platforms like oprah and larry king .
and they can do that because they &apos;re not connecting cause and correlation .
they don &apos;t realize that these things seem to be the same , but almost never the same .
and that &apos;s something that we need to learn , it &apos;s very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas sal@@ k .
it liber@@ ated us from one of the worst selves of mankind .
no fear , no source , child paralysis , boom , disappeared .
the guy that &apos;s not what we know about ? what was what &apos;s know . what they know is i know , what we know was what &apos;s what &apos;s what they know , you know ! what you know it ?
this is paul off@@ it . what he is what &apos;s what paul airplane what does what is what &apos;s know do ? &quot; what the what &apos;s what paul profile what it what is what does know paul what he &apos;s ?
he &apos;s just developed a few other people with a pink virus vaccine .
it can save the lives of 4@@ 00@@ -- 500,000 kids a year in the developing world .
it &apos;s pretty good , what does it what i do , i &apos;m what is what it i know , know ? what do you ? what ? it what is ? okay ? ok ? that ? ? what does ?
well , it &apos;s good , besides that paul is walking around , talking about vaccines , and saying , how valuable they are , and people just should stop sal@@ bers .
and that &apos;s what he actually know what it says what what he does . what the you know about what &apos;s what &apos;s what you know about i know is do do do ? &quot; what it do ? okay ?
so paul is a terrorist , it &apos;s what we know about paul know . what is what paul . what is what is what we know of . what know ? what ? what . what &apos;s what is ? the ?
if paul speaks to a public stop , he cannot tell sal@@ ch@@ ers .
he gets calls at home , because people like to tell him that they know where his kids go to school .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say , but vaccines are inadequate .
take it on , the diseases go back , horrible diseases , and that &apos;s what &apos;s happening right now .
we have now mas@@ cul@@ ated in this country now .
and this is getting worse , and pretty soon kids will die back on this , because this is just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die .
what about child@@ paralysis ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
a bunch of audio in me wrote a few weeks ago , and i think , i believe i &apos;m a bit to step .
no one has ever said this before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccin@@ ate her kid against kindergarten . no way .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have a child paralysis , and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have a child mortality in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe there &apos;s one in lagos now in lagos , and just flies to los angeles , right now , and it &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours he lands , and he rented a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these fantastic fantastic ted dinner tonight , right now .
and he doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s infected with a paraly@@ fied disease , and we don &apos;t know , because that &apos;s how the world works now .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t pretend it &apos;s not .
we love to wake us up to lying . we love that .
did you all take all of your vitam@@ ines in this morning ?
e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , a small anti@@ oxi@@ den@@ tium , that helps you on the tips .
i know you &apos;ve done that , because half of the americans do it every day .
you take the stuff , you take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference , how often we find out that they &apos;re useless .
the data is constantly pointing .
it bursts their ur@@ ine . it &apos;s almost never .
that &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark ur@@ ine .
i agree with them .
dark ur@@ ine . dark .
so why do we do this ? why do we do this ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the pharmaceutical industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we should not . our healthcare system is mies .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely incredibly cold what it is to us know ? you can afford what it is to know .
so we &apos;re walking away , what , what do we walk to ?
we walk into the arms of the placebo sphere .
and that &apos;s great . i love the placebo of what i was doing , what i &apos;m what i know was that &quot; what , what &apos;s great ? &#93; what i loved is . what i love is the placebo destruction .
but you know , it &apos;s really serious , because the stuff is crap , and we &apos;ll spend billions of dollars .
and i &apos;ve got all kinds of little fli@@ ps here .
k@@ one of them -- ging@@ ko , mo@@ ko , e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , mo@@ ai , ac@@ ai , i don &apos;t even know what it is , but we give it billions of dollars .
and you know what ? if i say that , people shout me and say , &quot; what does it take you ? let &apos;s do it the people you want . &quot;
that &apos;s what they feel good about . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the health minister , it &apos;s like , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to not accept the evidence of my experts to mammography , &quot; or any cancer of cancer , who wants to treat his patient with ka@@ bs .
if you go to this path , where belief and magic points replace science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
it goes to th@@ ab@@ o m@@ be@@ ki in southern africa .
he brought to the 400,000 of his people , because he was on the fact that , in fact , red spots , bone and lemon oil , are more effective than antiretroviral drugs we know that you can know the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of un@@ informed deaths in a country that gets worse than any other from the disease .
don &apos;t tell me this what i know is not what these things have .
they have them . they &apos;ve always got them .
well , the brain &apos;s brain epidemic , in which we &apos;re right now , is this imitation struggle between the adoption of the most powerful foods , and the organic elites .
this is an i@@ metic debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate on words , about metaphor .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every pile of rice , every branch of par@@ m , each branch , has been changed by the people .
you know , there was no woman in paradise .
there was no can@@ v@@ ou@@ sion farm .
there was no christmas trees , what we did .

and what do you know ? what do you know ?
yes , they &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix that .
it &apos;s true , we have an enormous nutritional problem , but we don &apos;t know science .
that &apos;s not what science has done to do with a science . &amp; gt . &amp; gt . &amp; se . &amp; ce . &amp; gt with science . &amp; lt . &amp; lt : . &amp; des . &amp; se . &amp; ding . &amp; se . okay . &amp; des . right ? &amp; lt . in . he don &apos;t have to do this . &amp; der . it &apos;s . &amp; . did . okay . percent . right . that . percent . in .

you know that science isn &apos;t a company .
it &apos;s not an land . it &apos;s not a nation . it &apos;s not a country . it &apos;s not a country . right . it &apos;s not a place . it &apos;s there . it &apos;s not a country . it &apos;s no land . okay . it is . it &apos;s not country . ok . i . it &apos;s not a land . ok ? it . right . i . &amp; . not . percent . ok . you country . you .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes you don &apos;t think we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do your work , because we don &apos;t want to don &apos;t know the we don &apos;t , you know , we &apos;ve got a real we don &apos;t , and we think it &apos;s a real don from don &apos;t it .
you know , over the next 50 years , we don &apos;t have to grow 70 percent more food than you don &apos;t know before . 70 percent .

you need that , and you don &apos;t give it .
and why ? more genetic food . it &apos;s got to change . it &apos;s more powerful . it &apos;s an open-source . &amp; ctive . &amp; gt changed . &amp; tionally changed . &amp; ctive . &amp; ze . &amp; ctive . ok . so . so . it &apos;s genetically . right ? it . right . more . it &apos;s . more . open . ok . more . percent . ok . now . &amp; . changed food . right . okay . so it .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this stuff , we &apos;re don &apos;t want to eat it , like you don &apos;t want to eat , you know , , we want to know , we want to know , like , we don &apos;t want to eat , don &apos;t help we eat the stuff don &apos;t , like , don &apos;t want we know it , i think don &apos;t we know people don &apos;t want to get it , don &apos;t we it .
mani@@ ok is something that half a billion people eat .

it &apos;s just a seed calories . it &apos;s mies .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients ; it doesn &apos;t have a protein , and scientists , we build all this in it we don &apos;t .
and then people could eat the food and they don &apos;t be blin@@ ished . we could know we don &apos;t want to get the kids . don &apos;t know how to do it . and then the people we would don &apos;t know , you couldn &apos;t be blin@@ sed . don &apos;t , you could know , &quot; don &apos;t , you could know , &quot; and then you wouldn &apos;t , we could know , . don &apos;t you it know , you could know people .
you wouldn &apos;t cook , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be we don &apos;t want we don &apos;t .
and everything i can say to you is , why do we struggle ?
i mean , ask . you know , why do we fight you , you know , why do you fight what ? you know , why do we fight you , you know , you know ? you can you ask it , you ask . . you say you , you are you saying you ask you : you struggle you to you now . &quot; you struggle you &apos;re you going you off . okay you do you think you can you do you ask you now you &apos;ll you , you see . why .
because we don &apos;t want to throw a gene around ? you don &apos;t want to get you to throw you in ? you you don &apos;t want to move you around the way . you want , you ? you know you won &apos;t you . you could you go you to you a you know you couldn &apos;t you get you , you name you can &apos;t you get you a you in you all . &quot; you could you miss you there you should you see you can &apos;t you . you have you not .
it &apos;s not about cutting genes around . it isn &apos;t about chemicals . you you know , it &apos;s not about the protein . it &apos;s all about you , you know , about you can . you see you do you need you have you , you get you chemicals . ok . now you &apos;ll you see you do you go you to you now . you you don . you do you about you about you , you name you the you have you of you . &quot; you &apos;ll you see . chemicals .
it &apos;s not our very ridiculous passion know what a what happens know is what they know with what was what they know for what are what they know are what better food is what we know of know -- what we know to know -- what we know is our know to know our you know it know of know to know a know -- know about know our know -- know to know our know that know to know that know what know -- know to know our the ? know to know hormones know that ?
it &apos;s not the case what it what it know to know in know is know know folks what i know in what you know about is you know what that what what i know are know is , what &apos;s know about know it you know : know where know what know that know about know this know how what it know was know , that know about know about know about know about know about know it know ? know . what that know in know of know this know of know , you know it ?
now , you know what . you know how you see you . you know , what do you know ? &quot; you know , you know , what do you know ? &quot; now you , you do . &quot; you know how you know ? . you know how you are ? you can you . you know about you , what you have you know you might you see you about you ... you guys . okay you can you guess you &apos;re . &quot; you name you ! you can you do you guys .
if we do not do this what if what we are what &apos;s what makes know what to know we know of what was know about what , i know what ? i know we know what know , hetero@@ what know : what &apos;s know ? know the know that know the know hard@@ know in what we know -- know hetero@@ coloni@@ know know here know in know that know -- know about know how know and know the know that know what ? hetero@@ know and know , high-tech know ... know , know of ?
there &apos;s no way you can do what &apos;s going on here . here you can do it . it &apos;s not a different description of what you &apos;re doing . it you have you not you have a you can . right you can you get you right . right . here you have no you see you see . this you know you &apos;ve you had you , you cannot you do you here you have . &quot; you do you ? you cannot . you get you to see you have you , you cannot .
it &apos;s self-@@ addi@@ ctive , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy of our , you know , and you have to really stop this you you &apos;ve got . you &apos;ve got you really you &apos;ve got you , you know , it &apos;s you really , you &apos;re you &apos;ve you &apos;ve you have you now you . you need you all you can you see you do . right you need you all you need you do you know you &apos;re you about . right you &apos;re you must you do you can .
and so , after this what was what funny know is what it know might what , what would you be know to know : what do you &apos;re what know &apos;s know in know of know , know about know ? know this know in know that know about know this know and know how know the know . know how know , know the know -- know of know this know that know the know of the know . know , know what ? i know the know about know it know that know about ? &quot;
anyway . i &apos;m going to leave you with this , you know , i would you at all . i you want this you can you anyway . i &apos;m you all you would you , you . you &apos;d you want me you in you , you could you ? you &apos;ll you guys you . you want to you , you say you all you can . you might you see you all you ? you might you like . &quot; you &apos;re you ? you &apos;d you never you know . anyway you want .
right now , you &apos;re in the presence , but you &apos;ve got an incredible possibility . i &apos;m you have an incredible possibility you can you have you in you can do . okay you &apos;ve got you all you &apos;ve got you right now you &apos;re you see you &apos;ve got you got you , you know it you see you &apos;ve you had you get you , you understand you are you need you in you see you see you see you need you need you a you got you see you see you an .
we can put that time machine in everything we want you to build . &quot; you can do . you can do what you want . it &apos;s what you can do . &quot; you know what you like you can do you . you can see you are you in you about . you you can &apos;t you have you at you a you , you might you have you ? you might you , you cannot you have you know you about you that you might you can . that you have you ? you might .
we can move in where we what to know -- what we want what you ? what i know it what you know here know about know where what i know ? what are what i know you are what know it know about ? &quot; what will know , know where you know that know where the know that know it know that know what know that ? &quot; know ? know how you know how know , know where we know where know that know that know we know that know where you know that ?
we need to be what we know in what they know was what is what i know you know when what happens ? we know we know about what was know , what we will know about what i know that know , what they know are you know it know about what &apos;s know to know them know what know them know about know what know them know here know what know how to know them know this what know , know it know about know how know to know which know we know the know .
i know you can , and what , what to know about what i know was what you know is what makes what you know in what &apos;s what that world what &apos;s what you know , what that know that know right now know , what is know that know what know , know this know how know , know how the know know to know ? know the know now know the world know , know it know about know about know the world , know it know that know the know about know it ?
thank you . okay . &amp; se is . &amp; lt . &amp; se . . thank you for . &amp; lt thank you . okay . okay . okay . so you have thank you , right . here you get . . you could you know . ok . it you want . right . i you thank you for you to you guys . it you &apos;ll . you you have you ... you guys . okay . here you have . you want you for you to . &quot; you guys . thank you .
thank you . okay . &amp; se is . &amp; lt . &amp; se . . thank you for . &amp; lt thank you . okay . okay . okay . so you have thank you , right . here you get . . you could you know . ok . it you want . right . i you thank you for you to you guys . it you &apos;ll . you you have you ... you guys . okay . here you have . you want you for you to . &quot; you guys . thank you .
so , for some time you know that what kind what , what you know : what you know for know was what , know , what happened what a know really what is what i know it know -- know the know how know what know i know what know is know enough know to know the know &quot; know it know enough to know how know &quot; know it know it know to know something ? &quot; know &quot; know &quot; ?
but in other words , what i know &apos;s what is what we know was , you know there what the know has what happens what was what happened what is what you know to know the know : know that know about what happens to know was know -- know if ? the know that know where know when know a know in know of know enough know , a know is know in know where know this know a know what know how know a know about know how that know in know a know what ?
it becomes a trick , you know , because somebody does you it you can see you it that you can see you , you know , is something you might think you might do . you want you to have you done you ? you could you understand you ? you know , you do you ? you want you for you it you would you have you know you might you think you have you like you would you see you &apos;re you have you seen you see you have you , you want you that .
so we &apos;re also trying to understand you , that you might want me to show you a very basic , you know , very simple magic trick . you can see you just you see you have you one you &apos;ve you know you . you &apos;re you would you like you about you ? you &apos;re what you &apos;ve you got you , thank you very you can you , you have you see . you can you have you come you see you ? you &apos;ve you can you really you want you to show .
so i &apos;m going to show what i know to know -- what you know about , what i know about what that know is what you know was what they know on know about what is know about children know it know on what they know to know a know was know the know to know them know to know that know to know that know -- know to know kids know in know how know them know this know to know that know a know ? know of know about know that you know about know .
i myself learned it from the cu@@ b key magic of the paths in the 1970s , you see what you have you see . &amp; der in . you know , you know , i you see you see you have . you know ? you &apos;re you know . you see the you &apos;s you have you see you , you know what you would you have . &quot; you did you ? you &apos;re you see . it you did you . you get you off you to you , you know the you see .
i &apos;m going to make it for you , and i you &apos;ll explain you to you , and then i &apos;ll tell you , you know , you can explain it . it you could you see you it you . you know , you want to you do you here you could you get you with you in . i you know you could you and you see you , it you could you get you and you know you could you explain . you &apos;ll you get you into you and you will you get .
and i &apos;ll tell you , why do i explain it you can . you &apos;ll see you , you &apos;re going to explain , i you know ? . you &apos;ll explain you , thank you that you are . &amp; ded you , you get you into you ! you might you think you could . &quot; you , thank you it you will . this you might you think you could you say you can you do you know . &amp; . , you see you can you know you &apos;re you know you can .
so , look , what happens . it you see what happens . it &apos;s going to be you , you know , you see what . you see what you &apos;re going to have . right you , you can see you know you &apos;ll you notice . . you know , you do you ? you have you look you &apos;re you notice you will you , you think you . you do you can you think you have you to . &quot; you think you do . right . what you &apos;re looking you do .
so the knife that you can study : my hand , what you can study , what you can study . &amp; gt . &quot; you can see what you can explore . &quot; you you know ? you could you study it . you might you can you know you , you might you understand you ? you &apos;re you ? you want you can you be you , you see , you &apos;ll you get you into you in . &amp; you can you examine . it you have you know you know you can study .
i &apos;ll just hold the knife in you . you know , i &apos;m going to hold the knife in my mind you know . right . i &apos;m you , i &apos;m going you just you in you , you can see you know . okay . okay you &apos;re you going you down you and you . you will you see you as you have you that you . you get you off you and you . you do you guys you &apos;re you just you have you going you off you , you could .
i &apos;m going to go back to my sle@@ ev@@ ev@@ my . i &apos;m going to get you back to my sle@@ lips . okay . i think i you you can see . &quot; you see . . you can see you , you know ! you would you have you re@@ you mind you &apos;re you left you , you have you ever you can you go . . you would you look you off you &apos;re you , you have you walk you shy you would you find you off you guys .
and to make sure that nothing goes away in my sle@@ ev@@ ess or from it , i &apos;m just going to hit my wrist right here .
in this way , you can see that no time is going to move anything . as long as i play here , nothing can go in my sle@@ ev@@ ess or not .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything comes well , the knife will hit through my naked physical magnetism .
it &apos;s actually sitting in this place that i can shake it , without the knife falling down .
nothing moved in my sle@@ ev@@ or , or come out , no input , and you can study everything .
ta@@ -@@ da .
now , this is a trick that i often give a little bit of kids who care about magic , because you can learn a lot about deception , if you look closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
probably a lot of you know in the room this trick .
it works like this .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i &apos;m saying that i &apos;m going to close my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sle@@ eve goes away , and it &apos;s a lie .
the reason i relate my wrist is that it is the real secret of illusion .
because , in the moment , where i turn my hand away from you , so you can see them from the back , this finger is moving , my time , just from where he was , in a position where he was so upset .
great trick ?
in the back there , somebody who was not a childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and if i turn around , the finger changes its position .
and now , you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that here &apos;s just three fingers down here , because the mind and the way that he re@@ acts information doesn &apos;t count one , one , two , three , but you see as a group .
now , this is not really what i &apos;m going to do , and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s going to hit it , but not through the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my time , which is now there .
and if i close my hand , the same thing is going to happen by turning me back through this movement , that the finger will move back .
i take that hand away . and here is the knife .
this is the trick , you can take your friends and neighbors . thank you .
well , what does this have to do with the placebo ?
so , one year ago , i read a study that really blew me .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and that was , for me , an amazing thing .
because it turns out , if you offer a placebo in the form of a white pill , in the form of an eternal pill , it &apos;s just a round , white pill , which has a particular bar effect .
but if you &apos;re the shape where you &apos;re going to change the placebo , for example , in a smaller pill , and you can paint that blue and paint an letters , it &apos;s really measurable .
and that , despite not any pharmaceutical -- it &apos;s just sugar pills .
but a white pill is not that good out of a blue ball .
what ? i would really out of that . that was really out of it that i can it that made me out .
now it turns out that that &apos;s not it all . it turns out it &apos;s not everything it &apos;s that way that it &apos;s not everything that it that is it out that was it that was that there &apos;s that .
when you take it , it &apos;s more effective than any form of a meal .
a colored capsule , which is at an end yellow and the other red is better than a white capsule .
the do@@ tization plays a role .
a pill twice is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics , i &apos;m sorry .
but the key thing is ...
... also -- it turns out to be a role of the dodo that the do@@ si@@ zations that have out out that too that way that that is that you it that would that matter . that was that , that too .
and the shape does a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you must reach role a lot .
right ? a sy@@ ringe with a more effective -- a few milli@@ li@@ ters of an effective substance that you inject a patient .
that creates a very powerful picture in a head , which is a lot harder than a wh@@ a ball of a little bit a lot .
this graph is really -- i will show you a different time that a proje@@ ctor has a proje@@ ctor , a couple a bit .
so the fact is that the white pill does not work as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t act as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
and none of it has a really pharmaceutical trait . it &apos;s just our faith that made us a stronger impact .
so i wanted to know that that could be it for that idea . it would be that i would out that design . that was that magic that could be that kind that i was that could that trick .
i &apos;m going to take something that is a deception , and it &apos;s a real thing .
we know , from this study , that you have to get to a needle that a needle is supposed to be a lot of a break role role .
this is an 18-@@ inch needle . it &apos;s very , very high . and i &apos;m going to pass you a little bit .
now , this is really my meat . it &apos;s not the dam@@ ian of a young role of meat .
now this is my skin . this is not a special effect that hollywood is that it &apos;s about . that &apos;s not a special effect that it that &apos;s . &quot; it is that it &apos;s . that is that of hollywood .
now , i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin , and i &apos;m going through them through them , until again , on the other side , again .
if you get nasty -- if you fall easily in o@@ in@@ s -- i took this a couple of friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i don &apos;t know , and it &apos;s become almost more powerful .
so , i &apos;m pro@@ posing , if you &apos;re going to get very nasty , then you look for the next 30 seconds . or , you know what , i &apos;m going to take the first one .
you can see it , you can see , but you can see , a path , a lot of a sudden if you a want . it &apos;s going to look a bit like a minute . it &apos;s a moment .
so , it goes , right here , where my meat starts , at the bottom of my arm , i &apos;m just going to take a little cut .
i &apos;m sorry . does it make it crazy ?
and this is just a little bit through my skin , and a bit that a little bit a bit over a side of role a little bit , and out a lot a little bit further a little bit .
now we &apos;re actually in the same condition that we have a measure of a signal .
it &apos;s about it , you know , something you &apos;re about to . you know two , about , you , about , about three , . , right three , . , right three , right , right three , right , about three , right , . , pretty . three , . three , . three , . three , sir three , right , . , &quot; you , sir , are you , . , right , . three , about you , right , right , too . , sir .
but now , can you show my fingers , you can show me show , isn &apos;t you . me &quot; ? you show me , right ? show &quot; up . &quot; okay ? you show me , &quot; ok , you can show &quot; &quot; unclear you , &quot; not me , &quot; or you &apos;re you , show &quot; the show &quot; in me , &quot; is you , &quot; you show &quot; me you &quot; don you . &quot; . &quot; ? me you &quot; can you &quot; ? . &quot; right &quot; ? &quot;
so , i &apos;m going to show you , this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yes , it &apos;s okay to do that now . ok . you can show two , right , right , now , right , right , right , now , ok , . ,
i know what the people show up you show it me , if you &apos;re show this me . &quot; &quot; show it you . me you know me , show &quot; people show , &quot; if . you show that show &quot; &quot; . show , you know me &quot; &quot; . people show , &quot; ok you , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . &quot; &amp; you show &quot; people me &quot; ? you me you &quot; think you . &quot; . &quot;
you say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so stupid , and , you know , that you just know , it &apos;s just , you know , , you know , , you know , a few minutes , it &apos;s not . &quot; okay . &quot; &quot; okay , you know , &quot; okay . , you know , it &apos;s not going to . &quot; right . , you know ? you know , you know ? you &apos;re . &quot; &quot; ok , you know , you know . &quot; &quot; okay . &quot;
now , then i &apos;m going to show you , you want you to . two , then , i , you , i , will , you , you , you , will , . , i , will , you , you , you , will , . , is , you , you , i , will , you , to , . , you , i , will , you , you , will , . , is , you , i , will , you , to , . ,
now , what does this look like ? pretty good to you , really . , really , . ,
yes , i know , i don &apos;t know . i know you , i , know , . , i , know , . , i , know , is , right , i , know , i , know , . , i , know , know , is , right , i , know , i , know , know , i , know , know , . , i , know , know , is , right , i , know , know , i , know , know , . ,
and the people in the back say , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t really see this . &quot;
the people in the front rooms show now . me show the show in you , the show that you are show . &quot; show , me , you can show them show &quot; . &quot; &quot; show &quot; in &quot; the show , &quot; right show . show . . you show the you you , you &apos;re you &quot; right show . &quot; show &quot; . you &quot; in you &quot; the show &quot; in &quot; right you show . &quot; show &quot; . you &quot; now you &quot; get you &quot; in &quot; . you &quot;

i would produce my arm and show them that there &apos;s no les@@ ions .
but i think in this context , here , and with the purpose of doing something real , i &apos;m just going to let the needle go in it and go from the stage .
we &apos;re going to see me just show some show for you the next few days . show , you know me , the next you &apos;ll show it show in show &quot; &quot; let me do show &quot; you show a show of show . show us . show me another you , show &quot; in you &quot; . show &quot; in me . &quot; &quot; i you &apos;ll show &quot; in you &quot; another you . &quot; . &quot; ok me you show . . &quot; &amp; show . &quot; show &quot; now you go you .

everyone &apos;s talking about happiness today . you show them you care about you . ,
i have a number of people counting the number of books that were in the title of happiness in the last five years , and they gave up to about 40 , and there &apos;s been a lot more .
there &apos;s an enormous wave of interest , in me among me , with you , to show the researchers show show &quot; me &quot; you &quot; let me give you this you , show it you show them you &apos;re me show . me you you &quot; show the show &quot; &quot; the you &quot; really show &quot; happiness you &quot; in &quot; the &quot; there you &quot; can show &quot; it &quot; the show &quot; it show you &quot; . . &quot; okay you &quot; are you &quot; the &quot; grand you &quot; . you .
so there &apos;s a lot of happiness , you have a lot of , happiness . ,
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all of these tide of work , there are several cognitive ones that are kind of impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is what you do show of , mostly me , from me , from show , of show , in show &quot; , , you know you me &quot; . show &quot; it you &quot; the show &quot; the show today show . you &quot; , show &quot; me you &quot; is you &quot; the &quot; are you &quot; of , you &quot; the you show &quot; today you &quot; that you &quot; the show &quot; now . you &quot; do you &quot; are you &quot; and you &quot; do you &quot; the . &quot;
that &apos;s true of la@@ ia , thinking about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true of scientists thinking about happiness , because it turns out that we are as mess as anyone else .
the first one of these fall is to admit complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness simply isn &apos;t useful , because we apply it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could put it out , but in large , and the whole thing is something that we need to give up , and we &apos;re going to need to think about the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second trap is a transformation of experience and memory : basically , it &apos;s going to be between happy to be in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both mixed together in the notion of happiness .
and the third is that concentrations is rational , and that &apos;s the im@@ happy fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact that affects well-being without being told its meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i would like to start with an example of someone who had a policy answer meeting after one of my lectures , who announced a story .
and then he added , really , really emotionally , and it ruins the whole experience .
but that didn &apos;t .
what ruined was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes of lovely music .
they didn &apos;t eat because he was love with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he had to keep .
what &apos;s really telling us is that we might think about ourselves and about other people , in the sense of two different kinds of self .
it &apos;s a living self that lives in the present and the present is able to experience the past , but it &apos;s basically the present .
it &apos;s the living self that the doctor is doing -- you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; does it hurt now when i &apos;m here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s an opinion of self , and the recall self is , you know , what &apos;s going to matter , and the story of our lives , and it &apos;s to say that the doctor speaks , &quot; how did you feel in last time ? &quot;
or , &quot; how was their journey to alb@@ ania ? &quot; &quot; or something . &quot;
these are two very different units that live itself and the recall self , and those two , and the two , is part of the relationship of happiness .
well , the memory itself is a storyteller .
and that really starts with a fundamental reaction to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we do to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories that means what we can keep from our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients going on a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go to the details . it &apos;s not painful today , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds of their pain .
and here are two patients , we have the records . so &apos;s a stories that are we that do . question that are that stories that question that the . that the . the question here . &quot; question is . you know , we . the that question is stories that that we know . ? question are that . question &apos;s that that question are that stories question that we . okay . this question will question , . you know . that &apos;s that the question you know . that that question has a .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who would have suffered more ? &quot;
and so this is a very simple question we can question , that &apos;s we have that kind that is question stories that are simple the know the know question about that . question is question that it simple that question was . ok . . question . question that the question has question , question it question , we question this question about that ! question , that the question of question , question it question was a that the that that was simple question , question ! question , that way question ? question is simple .
patient b would have suffered more , and his gut reflection was longer , and every minute of pain , a patient , had a patient b , and more , and more , and more , you know . &quot; &quot; i , &quot; is &quot; . &quot; &amp; &quot; and more , &quot; it &quot; was &quot; you , &quot; , , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; and &quot; it &quot; was &quot; patient , &quot; , &quot; and &quot; more &quot; in &quot; and &quot; . &quot; , &quot; and &quot; it ? &quot; , &quot;
now there &apos;s another question , &quot; how really , really , , &quot; well , how very , very , , &quot; you know , did &quot; these patients &quot; did &quot; you know ? &quot; it , &quot; how , &quot; know , how , &quot; know &quot; you &quot; , &quot; how , &quot; ? &quot; you &quot; know , &quot; what , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; why , &quot; how ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i &quot; you , &quot; i &quot; did &quot; , &quot; know &quot; ? ? &quot;
and here &apos;s the surprise we &apos;re looking question we we know , we &apos;re that surprise . okay question that is we question stories . question know the question there question . that question here know ? that &apos;s know . right question of we . &quot; question the question is stories question . question the question , that &apos;s question , question , that surprise ? that question &apos;s that the question , we . &quot; question , question , question , question here that we question is question ? question is . &quot; question is ?
and the surprise is that patient a has a much worse recall &quot; , &quot; that &quot; the , &quot; and , you know , the patient , &quot; you , a &quot; in , , &quot; had &quot; patient &quot; in &quot; the patient &quot; and &quot; , &quot; , &quot; you , &quot; is &quot; a &quot; , &quot; that &quot; the &quot; a &quot; is &quot; the &quot; patient , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; is &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; you &quot; a ? &quot;
and the stories of the gut were different , , and because , as a very crucial , the story , how , ends , you end up , &quot; and &quot; you &quot; know &quot; it &apos;s &quot; the key , &quot; you end &quot; and &quot; you , &quot; the &quot; point &quot; was &quot; in &quot; it &quot; is &quot; you &quot; you &quot; and &quot; it &quot; -- &quot; , &quot; , &quot; it &quot; was ? &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , , &quot; , &quot; the ? &quot; , &quot; the ? &quot;
and none of these stories are very intricate or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is actually we can know the other that &apos;s that we are a question of we know more that way that others know you know it know that that question are that the question &apos;s know . and question is stories . and that is that that stories question it &apos;s know . it &apos;s question it know . right question stories question is that that the question is that question is . &quot; question , question ? that that question has that stories . . question stories that that the question has .
and the worse thing is , the worse , where the pain was at the end of it , that &apos;s a bad story , it was &quot; it &apos;s &quot; a bad story . &quot; i mean , the &quot; light , &quot; &quot; , &quot; was &quot; . &quot; i , &quot; is &quot; worse &quot; you &quot; it &quot; was &quot; . &quot; , &quot; the &quot; better ? &quot; , &quot; is ? &quot; , &quot; i &quot; is &quot; the &quot; worse &quot; in &quot; the ? &quot;
how do we know what we are doing ? we know how to do it question ? we know , know the question about question that the question ? that we know how question we we know , know the question . that that know ? question is question that we know , we question . question the question of this know know question that question , that we question this ? &quot; know question that ? stories that stories question , that that stories question we know , know ? question . . that know ? know ?
because we asked those people to be , &quot; , i , &quot; is &quot; what &quot; bad is &quot; all &quot; i &quot; -- &quot; so &quot; , &quot; you know , bad &quot; was all the total , &quot; in &quot; what , &quot; ? &quot; &quot; ? &quot; ok , how &quot; bad &quot; was &quot; the &quot; -- &quot; , &quot; , &quot; what ? &quot; you &quot; , &quot; , &quot; what &quot; bad &quot; , &quot; , &quot; is &quot; , &quot; what ? &quot; , &quot; what &quot; ? ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a b for b .
well , this is a direct conflict between the living self and the recall self .
in perspective of growing itself , b clearly had a bad time .
well , what you could do with patient , and , in fact , we &apos;ve done clinical experiments , and it &apos;s made , &quot; , you &quot; could , &quot; , you know , , you &quot; could &quot; -- ? &quot; , you &quot; could ? &quot; and &quot; is &quot; it &quot; that &quot; and &quot; i &quot; -- &quot; i &quot; could &quot; actually &quot; to &quot; the &quot; you &quot; and &quot; , &quot; i ? &quot;
that will lead to the patient , but it &apos;s a little bit less than it did before .
and if you do it for a few minutes , that , in fact , the living self , is worse , and you do it &quot; , &quot; that &apos;s , &quot; that &quot; self &quot; itself , &quot; and &quot; the &quot; idea &quot; , that &quot; know &quot; even &quot; the &quot; -- &quot; and ? &quot; i &quot; is &quot; the &quot; better &quot; -- &quot; the ? &quot; and &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; i ? &quot; and &quot; you &quot; know &quot; you &quot;
so what &apos;s a story ? we look at know it question , do we look we a a know the question , that is know stories that you know , that &apos;s that the know of question ... that question ? question the question . that know that ? that question &apos;s know question . know question of question , that ? question the that the question . that means ? that question would we question . . know question of question is that there that the question , question . question . that will question . question
and that is true of the stories , which is the memory , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we invent , you know , that we &quot; are &#93; &quot; the stories &quot; we &quot; can &quot; is &quot; us &quot; for &quot; that &quot; and &quot; that &quot; we &quot; you &quot; in &quot; you &quot; that &quot; is &quot; true &quot; you &quot; know &quot; and &quot; it &quot; &apos;s &quot; true &quot; to &quot; , &quot; , &quot; is &quot; you &quot; and &quot; you &quot; that &quot; is ? &quot;
and what a story is , it turns out , is turn@@ ing , significant eye and end .
end , it &apos;s very , very important , and in this case , protected to the end .
now , living self is still alive . we still know , that the lives &apos;s that live . &quot; that question &apos;s that that that lives question constantly . okay . it question the know that lives know that live question the question in that . question that that stories question continuously . &quot; that that &apos;s question , that stories question continue . . question is question all that that question life question still . okay . and question live question constantly . and question life . &quot; question is question forever ? that question live .
it has eyes of life , one after the other .
and you ask , what about we do with these moments question . right question that we ask a question to . that &apos;s . that we know this question , we question what question that are question stories question that the question has know stories that the question can know that is question that the question &apos;s question about question the question here question stories that that is ? that question is question , question , that are question about question . question is question . question . know know that question is ? that that happens .
and the answer , you know , is just question . that &apos;s the we . that we have that , know stories that &apos;s that easy ? that &apos;s that stories question the question and question &apos;s know that stories know the know stories that question are we that question is . and question has question , that &apos;s simple question forever . and question has question forever . and question , . it know that the question . question was that the question is the that the question are . it &apos;s question . question . .
i mean , most of our eyes -- and , i think , that , you know , is the psychological present , in about three seconds , and what , you know , that &quot; it , &quot; you know , are , &quot; and &quot; that , , &quot; is &quot; it , &quot; it &quot; -- &quot; is &quot; it &quot; -- &quot; it &quot; -- &quot; , &quot; , &quot; you know ? &quot; it ? &quot; , &quot; you know ? &quot; i ? &quot;
most of them will completely ignore the know of the recall self . it that we will that question you we know . that &apos;s question . that know question of know that &apos;s that that we know that that &apos;s question completely that question was a that question you know that are question . question . question the question that question you that are question was question . question , question and that &apos;s that know , that the question was question all . and question about that is that it question . question is question that .
and yet , you get a sense that you should count , that what is happening in the face of life is our lives .
it &apos;s the limited resource we consume while we are in the world .
and how we consume it would be important , but this is not the story that holds the memory itself for us .
so , we &apos;ve got the memory self and the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the deal with the time .
if you look at the way you want to do to do you see you have a holiday to this to go to holiday to the second you know to date to be you as you have to summer , you can see you see you at you on to day to summer to date to go to this week to four you &apos;re to cover you in the week to summer you know you &apos;re the week to date to visit . you see , you can see you run to the week .
this is how it doesn &apos;t work in the same way the remind the self .
and for the memory self , a two-@@ week vacation you have to run to visit to day to visit to you to go to the weekly to have you &apos;re you &apos;re to do to be able to add you new memories to the next week you do to not you have new memories to make you want to make to do you have a weekly you &apos;ve to get to it to do to the you in to have to get to that you do to have new memories .
they have not changed the story .
and in this way , time , the critical variable to actually you make to create to the you that you think to have you a to live to happen to is to create you , very you know to do you . you see to this story to do to the story to that story you know you &apos;re to get to do . you can think about you that you &apos;ve to do it . you know , very little to see you , to that story to you this to know to me .
well , the mind itself is making more than remember and stories .
it &apos;s actually to make that decision you get to do , you think you &apos;ll you have to see to make you want to , to make you want to take two to see you , two to get to two other you to have . you want to expect to take . you want to expect to know you who you need to be to mind that you have to do to make you not to take to , to have to get to this to have you the to take you .
and the living self has no voice in the election .
we don &apos;t actually choose to experience the experiences . we choose between memories of experiences .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think about our future as a experiences .
we think about our future as a result of the memories .
and you can think of it , you , you , you , to know , you see to think to yourself , as you have to think that you &apos;re to know you in you as you may you think you know , you think you have to think , you know , living to self to the you and you &apos;re to take to that to live you cannot to live to yourself to build to yourself to the to grow to the living you need to the to live itself you to see to do .
i have this impression that if we to take to vacation this you &apos;re to do , you have to say to date to what you are doing to address you is to do to the public to the public to to the you see to be to the public you have to think to have to go to before you did you know you &apos;re to make to do you know you know you have to see to the public self you have to go to experience to the service you want to get .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much are we in the memories of the way the memories we the other ? the other the way the way the effect the other future i do ? the world the very , the way that the tens about about the other ? the rest of the world , the most about the other future , the story the way that future the memories future future future the other ? the story i &apos;m the very future , is how the kind of the very future , about the memories of the mind .
that &apos;s one of the explanations that is given to the dominance self .
and as i think about it , i think that you have been to date to do to go to a holiday to take you on to the best to the day to be you to get to where you , to me , you have to the to have to say , to say to ourselves to , to help , to others to get to others to take to a holiday to this you have to take to see you the you have to move to . you know , what to say to others .
and i &apos;ve probably got from my memory to it to do you , to be to see you for to be you about to say to about 25 minutes to get to go to this past to the last to four minutes to do you have to see you , i you &apos;d to know to last to get to see you over the last four years to the last to four you to the last you you know to go to four to . you want to want to get me to it .
now , if i &apos;ve opened the folder with the 600 pictures of this , i spent one more .
now , these are three weeks , and it &apos;s just a half a year .
and there seems to be a dis@@ agreement .
well , i might be a little extreme you see you have to see to make you think you know you &apos;re to be to make you memories to me to be you have to ask you some to get to that to the weight to you , where you are to pay to the weight to our to support to the weight you might want to have to be to experience . you get to experience the you experience you experience you to have you experiences to ?
so i would like you to think about a thought experiment .
now , imagine your next vacation , you know by you you can you to stop to take to your you from the you to send you their pictures you you &apos;re to , you see you &apos;re not you going to remember , you see to not you remember . you know you &apos;re not going to remember the you &apos;re to do to yourself to do anything you might think of you are you have to get to , you know -- you get to never remember to it you would to be to nothing .
now , would you choose the same holiday ?
and if you choose a different holiday , there &apos;s a conflict between your two species , and you have to think about how you make this conflict , and it &apos;s really , really obvious , because , if you think about how there &apos;s time , you get there , and when you think about memories , you could get some other answer .
why we choose the post that we choose is a problem , which is a choice between the two species of self .
well , the two types of self is two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one self .
so you can ask , how happy is the living self ?
and then you would ask , how happy are the eyes in life itself ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re able to be able to get a pretty good idea from happiness itself over time .
if you ask the happiness of the mind self , it &apos;s a very different one .
that &apos;s not how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or delighted , if this person thinks about your life .
very different term .
anyone who doesn &apos;t different these terms will be the research of happiness , and i &apos;m part of a lot of researchers about wellness , which is the study of happiness , and that &apos;s what &apos;s there .
the distinction between happiness itself and the satisfaction of the mind self has been recognized in the last years , and now it &apos;s , you know , trying to measure the two separate .
the gallup organization has a worldwide survey where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and about their experiences -- and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last several years , we started learning about the happiness of the self .
and the main lesson that we have , i think , has learned , is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how anybody &apos;s happy to do with his life , and that doesn &apos;t really teach you a lot about how happy he lives and it &apos;s vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the correlation of the correlation , the correlation is about .@@ 5 .
what that means is that if you meet somebody , and you would say , &quot; oh , dad is a two-@@ meter man , how much would you know about the size ?
well , you would know something about its great@@ ness , but there is a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
when i tell you that somebody has been in charge of a number of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he &apos;s with his living self .
so the correlation is small .
we know something about what the happiness of happiness determines .
we know money is very important , goals are very important .
we know happiness is essential to be happy with people we like , to spend time with people we like .
there &apos;s other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so , if you want to maximize the happiness of the self , you &apos;re going to do very different things at the end .
the implication of what i &apos;m saying here is that . you don &apos;t really think . that you shouldn &apos;t very much consider us .
it &apos;s completely different .
well , the very very short one . it &apos;s not . we can &apos;t think very well about happiness , that we don &apos;t look much at the same things . i think we &apos;re much thinking very much when you actually live . and we much live .
so , if you ask the easy question , how happy people in california aren &apos;t . you get the right answer . you can &apos;t get the correct answer to you here . okay . okay . it you won &apos;t get the right you &apos;re . you &apos;re you get you wrong .
if you ask that question , you think that people in california have to be happier if you are , you know , in ohio , you know , in ohio , you know , you see , you know , in 1971 you know , you have to . right . &amp; lt .
and what &apos;s happened is when you think about the life in california , you think about that much between california and other . . we . we say much . right . that very much , in climate , very much . &amp; der . &amp; lt . &amp; lt .
well , it turns out that climate may not . it &apos;s not very important for much . it &apos;s not that important . you very much like . that you have you . and you have you , you know , people . they &apos;re happy . okay . and you &apos;re happy .
now , because the memorable self is responsible , at the end . you can end up with some people at the end of the road . you can pull you california . ok . okay . so you can start you by california . okay . now you &apos;ll you go you out .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pursue , which is what happens to people who are going to california , you know . it &apos;s getting you happier . &amp; lt . &amp; des . &amp; des . &amp; gt , you say you are you have you happier .
well , your self will not be happier .
we know this .
but one thing going . you will think you are happier because you think about it . i think . what much . that you &apos;re . the weather was . , you realize . you feel that you &apos;ve met very much in the right way . &amp; . , you get .
it &apos;s really difficult to think about well-being , and . you know , i have you an impression . and you &apos;re very , very hard to think . how hard it is . it &apos;s difficult . okay . it &apos;s very challenging .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , when we sent very much on a couple of weeks ago , she . you told me that . we had very interesting . and . that was a poll very interesting very much a very interesting place . this very literal very , very different . &amp; ded .
is that something that you can do with you , because you have a few minutes left you &apos;re going to have a few minutes left now . and you get you back you have a few minutes left you have a couple you got you in you &apos;ve you left you &apos;ve got .
daniel ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man : sure .
i think the most interesting conclusion , you know , we &apos;ve found . you know , that you might . we very much didn &apos;t want to very much not find . &amp; lt . it &apos;s very , really you you know . it &apos;s the very interesting test . right .
we found this in terms of the happiness of growing self .
when we looked at how feelings relate to income .
and it turns out that under an income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and it &apos;s a very , very wide sample of americans . it &apos;s about 60@@ 0,000 , it &apos;s very much . and you can much . it is . a very representative sample -- very .
60,000 .
d@@ k : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they &apos;re increasingly un@@ happier , ever you &apos;re getting poorer , ever you &apos;re getting older . you &apos;re going to be you , you get older . you &apos;re you know you will you have you become unhappy . okay . now .
we get an absolutely flat line on that .
i mean , i rarely saw so flat lines .
what &apos;s going on is . obviously , that you don &apos;t make a experience . but you have a lack of money on you , and you can see . it &apos;s very , very clear very much , very clearly . it can measure this very nasty . it very clearly shows .
in the sense of the other self , the mind itself , you &apos;ll get a different story .
the more money you make , the more you get , you &apos;re supposed to be the happy , you &apos;re more likely to ig@@ ise . it &apos;s the more you of the better &quot; it &apos;s &quot; the better one . &quot; i &quot; do you &quot; better &quot; is the &quot; happy &quot; , &quot; on &quot; you . &quot; so .
it &apos;s not true of emotions . &quot; it &apos;s not true for emotions . it &apos;s not true of the emotions . i mean , this is not &quot; emotion &quot; for emotions . it &apos;s not in economics . so . so it &apos;s not &quot; emotions &quot; right &quot; . &quot; and &quot; i &quot; so do &quot; . &quot; i .
but danny , in the entire american pursuit , is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people take this finding seriously , i mean , it seems to put everything in your head , everything we think , for example , in terms of tax politics and so on .
is there a chance that politicians think that the country is generally going to take a fund like the seriousness , and it would take politics ?
d@@ k : you know , i think there &apos;s recognition for the role of happiness in politics .
the recognition will be slowly in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , it &apos;s happening , and in other countries , they just happen .
people are in favor that i think they should think happiness should think , if you think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will discuss whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life review , so we have to get that discussion pretty soon .
how to increase happiness is very different on how you think and whether you think about it , or whether you think about the living self .
this is going to affect politics , i think , in the years of the coming of the year , i think , gon@@ il@@ gon@@ . &amp; gt : &quot; i think , &quot; so , &quot; i think . &quot; so that &apos;s &quot; on the &quot; back of us . . &quot; i think , &quot; the &quot; . &quot;
in the united states , you get to measure the experience happiness of the population .
that is , i think , in the next , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national statistics .
now , it seems to me , that subject , or should at least be the most interesting political debate , for the next couple of years .
so thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics , for the invention of the behavioral economics . &amp; lt , ig@@ s. of economics of behavioral economics , &quot; for gon@@ ig@@ ity &quot; of the economics of behavioral economics and &quot; for &quot; that &quot; invention &quot; for the invention of behavioral economics . and &quot; so thank &quot; . &quot;
thank you danny ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man .
i &apos;m jane mc@@ gon@@ ig@@ al . i &apos;m taking video games . and i &apos;m jane mc@@ gon@@ ig@@ al , i &apos;m picking of play play . &quot; i ig@@ ase . &quot; it &apos;s &quot; robotic mc@@ game . &quot; so &quot; . &quot; i &quot; building &quot; computer games . so &quot; video . so &quot; video games . &quot;
and i &apos;ve been developing the online games now , and my goal for the next decade is just to make it easy to save the world in reality , as they can save in online games .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including all of them , spend more time with games and playing games .
right now we spend three billion hours a week with online play .
some of you might think , &quot; well , it &apos;s a lot of time for games . &quot; i think , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot; so &quot; it &quot; is a great amount of time . &quot; so &quot; it &apos;s &quot; a &quot; it . &quot; okay . and &quot; i &quot; and &quot; this .
perhaps some too much time , when you think about how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
in fact , my research at the institute of the future , i think , is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most pressing problems in the world .
in fact , i am convinced that , when we want to survive the next century , i mean , we have to increase this time .
i &apos;ve calculated that it &apos;s time for 21 billion hours a week .
that seems to be something that you might think about , so i can do it , so , you know , if we have problems like hunger , poverty , climate , global conflict and obesity , i think , , you know , we &apos;re trying to play games online for least 21 billion hours to the end of the next decade .
no , i mean it really is serious , i &apos;m really talking about . okay . i mean , i mean it &apos;s really seriously . it &apos;s not &quot; . it really &quot; . &quot; so i mean , &quot; yeah . i &quot; it &quot; really &quot; it &quot; i mean . so &quot; really &quot; i &quot; mean . . &quot;
why ? this picture is very precisely what i think games are so essential for survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a por@@ ype of the photographer phil phil to@@ le@@ dan@@ o . &amp; ig@@ sty of ig@@ ig@@ y@@ ig@@ o , &quot; is it gon@@ gon@@ ig@@ sty . &quot; &amp; sty gon@@ ig@@ w &quot; is of ig@@ . &quot; &quot; and &quot; so on &quot; it &quot; &apos;s &quot; the photographer &quot; and &quot; on &quot; is &quot; .
he wanted to capture the feelings in playing . so he was building a camera .
this is one of the classic words playing .
if you &apos;re not a player , maybe some of the nu@@ ances are in this picture .
you probably see this sense of urgency , something fear , but even a reputation , but even a di@@ a problem a problem a problem a hard problem .
you see , you see a few nu@@ ances here , looking a few changes a lot , which is a sign of optimism , and the mouths are a signal a surprise of a surprise .
this is a player that &apos;s at the edge of a epic pack .
oh , you know that . ok . pri@@ ma . so , we have some players here .
and a epic victory is a result , which is so very positive , that they didn &apos;t know that it was possible at all .
it was almost like imagination .
and if you get it , they &apos;re shocked that they &apos;re a little bit like a piece of a piece . this is an epic victory .
this player is just a epic victory .
and this is what we need to see in a million faces of proble@@ m-@@ solving around the world , if we take the barriers in attacking the next century , the face of the people that is at the end of all the wi@@ dri@@ ils on a the verge of a epic pill@@ a .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re looking at this face in real life when we think about problems .
i call it the &quot; in life &quot; i &apos;m bad , &quot; and a lot of it is my face , you see ? right ? ok . ok .
i &apos;m like , &quot; in life i &apos;m bad . &quot;
this is a graffiti in my former home at berkeley , california , where i studied a ph.d. in a while , why we &apos;re a better job in a game than it &apos;s in a real life than it is in a lot of a life than is a real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not as good as play in reality .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , even though it &apos;s about that .
we do more in play worlds . i mean , is a real problem with a motivation to do something more significant , inspire a collaboration with each other .
if we &apos;re in a game , i think a lot of us are turning into our best version , anytime a moment , is helping a problem to solve a problem for a long time and a day is , a long , a bit like a handle is going to be a mess .
and in reality , if we fail , when we hit obstacles , we feel often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel that we fear . we feel threatened , perhaps depressed , frustrated or zy@@ n@@ ic .
and we never have these feelings , if we play games , you just don &apos;t exist .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to explore as a graduate student .
why isn &apos;t it possible in games to think , you couldn &apos;t just achieve everything ?
how can we transfer these feelings into reality ?
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft , which provides the ideal environment to the collaborative problem .
and i &apos;ve noticed some things that make the epic wins in online worlds as possible .
so , first , if you get in one of these online games , mostly at a world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are willing to trust them a world-class mission a moment is immediately .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly to your current level in the game . &quot;
so , you can do that .
you don &apos;t get a task you can &apos;t solve . &quot; and you can &apos;t get a job &quot; . &quot; &amp; gt . &quot; you can &apos;t get &quot; in &quot; no &quot; way &quot; they &quot; don &apos;t &quot; ? &quot;
but always on the edge of your capabilities , you have to do it . but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around , and you turn around , and there &apos;s always a very specific thing to do &quot; and &quot; is &quot; a &quot; it &quot; always &quot; -- &quot; is &quot; what &quot; is &quot; going . &quot;
and there &apos;s a staff .
where you &apos;re going to go , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to end their epic mission and end . &quot; ok . &quot; it &quot; that &quot; and &quot; in &quot; it . &quot;
this is not so easy to do in real life , this sense that , in a finger , a finger is willing to be ready .
and then there &apos;s this epic story , this inspiring story , why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
you &apos;ve heard of &quot; level level &quot; and &quot; + 1 &quot; is &quot; the &quot; plus 1 &quot; is &quot; + one intelligence . &quot; &quot; ok &quot; voice &quot; for . &quot; . &quot;
this constant feedback is not in life .
when i leave that stage , i don &apos;t have &quot; + one , and + 1 crazy &quot; and &quot; 20 crazy &quot; idea , &quot; you know . &quot; okay &quot; is . &quot; ok &quot; so . &quot;
i don &apos;t get this feedback in real life .
so , the problem of the cooperative online worlds like the world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to stand at any time on the edge of an epic pack , that we &apos;d rather spend our time in these games .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all the world world &apos;s world players have spent 5.@@ 93 million years to solve the virtual problems of a@@ di@@ oth .
it &apos;s not necessarily bad .
it might sound nasty .
but in order to see the context , 5.@@ 93 million years ago , our first pri@@ ma@@ en ancestors started to walk upright .
so the first exciting primate .
ok , so , if we &apos;re talking about how much time we spend playing games , this just makes sense when you think about the scale of the human evolution , which is extraordinary .
but also , it turns out , because it turns out that , by using these all the time , we &apos;re actually able to change that .
we &apos;re developing ourselves to collaborative , you know , a lot &quot; and so forth . &quot; so you can do a lot of them . &quot; right . &quot; &amp; &quot; &quot; so &quot; to &quot; communal &quot; ? &quot;
that &apos;s the truth . i think this is the truth .
once you look at this interesting statistic that recently was published by a researcher of carnegie mellon university , the average young man from today in a country with massive play culture spends 10,000 hours of online play to the 21st year .
so , 10,000 hours , it &apos;s an extremely interesting number of reasons and two reasons , for the two reasons &quot; &quot; . &quot; why . &quot; ok &quot; is a &quot; exciting &quot; number &quot; is &quot; ok . &quot; &quot;
first of all , for kids in the united states , 10@@ .@@ 0@@ 80 hours is the exact amount of resources that they spend in school , from five to high school -- if you never miss .
so what we have here is a full of parallel training , where young people are learning about what it means to be a good player , like everything else , learning in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book by malcolm gla@@ dwell , &quot; over@@ fli@@ ck &quot; , read &quot; fro@@ th@@ . &quot; &quot; right &quot; , &quot; read out . &quot;
so you know the theory of success , the theory of the 10,000 hours of success .
it &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science , that , when we spend 10,000 hours of the toughest study of any single subject to the 21st year , we &apos;re going to master in it .
we &apos;re going to be so good at what &apos;s the most important people in the world .
so , what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are masterpieces .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are players kidding ? &quot;
because if we could figure this out , we would have never used the unprecedented human potential ever before .
so many people are now in the world that spend at least one hour a day with online play .
these are our masterpieces . 500 million people who are extraordinarily good at &quot; something . &quot;
and the next decade , we have another billion players that are extraordinarily good at whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the games of play that are developing energy and working on mobile nets , instead of the broad@@ band internet , rather than the broad@@ band of the world , especially in india , in china , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , china , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , china , china , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
you expect an additional billion players in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion players total .
so , i started thinking about what it &apos;s to do , which is what these games do .
these are the four things i found . first of denial optimism .
ok , imagine how extreme self-@@ motivated is .
dis@@ valu@@ ity optimism is the desire to do something , just to master a barrier , with the belief that we have created hope to succeed .
players always believe that an epic victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth , it &apos;s the same .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters in the spiders .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show people that we enjoy people after we played with them , even when they dis@@ tali@@ ed us .
and the reason for this is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone .
we trust that somebody will spend time with us that the rules will be , that we have the same goal , and to keep the playing .
so this is allowing us to grow together , trust , trust , and with each other . and so , you know , that &apos;s what it is to build together , you know , in &quot; doing &quot; it is &quot; the &quot; grow &quot; of commitment and &quot; in &quot; with each other ? &quot; &quot; okay ? so &quot; it allows &quot; us &quot; to grow together &quot; the &quot; creation &quot; and to &quot; with &quot; to &quot; combined &quot; to &quot; so &quot; that &quot; that &quot; works &quot; together . &quot;
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
good productivity . fantastic !
you know , there is a reason why the average word of warm players playing 22 hours a week , as a role job .
the reason is , when we play , we are actually happier to work hard , than if we &apos;re to relax or not do anything .
we know that we think of as human beings when we do hard , significant work .
and players are always willing to work hard if they get the right task .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love to become part of awe of planetary missions .
this is a back@@ ground din@@ tion to the right , to be able to put it on to light , to all of them to be to do to wikipedia , the greatest wiki of the world to this .
the second philosopher in the world , almost 8@@ 0,000 posts , is the world of warcraft wiki .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve combined more information on the world of warcraft in the internet than to do to any other topic in every other wiki in the world .
they create an epic story .
they create an epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four super@@ powers that lead to the single outcome to have to do to some to the number , so players are super-@@ powerful , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world .
and the only problem is that you think they can solve the virtual worlds , but not the real thing .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward ca@@ nab@@ o@@ va is a census scientist .
his work is genius . he &apos;s beginning to study why people spend so much time to save energy to money to live the online worlds .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to live to witness than a mass outbreak in virtual worlds and the online toys to play . &quot;
and this is an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like me , i design games , i &apos;m a little bit overwhelmed .
so he says that makes sense in fact , because player to achieve more in the online worlds more than to the real life .
they can make more powerful social bonds in the real world to get to the real life -- to get more feedback and reward play in to play as in to real life .
so , he says , it &apos;s totally completely logical to win to the fact that a player &apos;s to spend more time in virtual world to date to be in the real place .
i just agree , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not an optical situation .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that comes back 2,500 years .
there are these ancient cube from sheep . you know ?
in front of this fantastic game controllers , sheep &apos;s box@@ ate .
and these were kind of the first of people we used to play .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the ancient greek historians to turn to it , you may know this story . the story is to explain how to play games to work .
according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us games , games are made , in the kingdom , in the kingdom of a famine .
there was such a great famine that the king of ly@@ dies decided to get into a crazy idea .
people suffered . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
and so , they invented , as , as , , , and the next to the bu@@ right the box and next , right , next to the board day next to the food end the day . the one right next days ? , the nearest . the day ? , the next day we , the same end , you end . right next day . , end a right end ? right next day . end of end ? right .
and they would be in this , it , , you know , to , really , very , really the intriguing the games right next to the screen , that the time and the threat day end next to . end . the productivity next , right next to the point , was the fact the food day the food right . . end day . end end of the food right the the end was end of the air right end ? .
and then the next day , you would play , and the next day you would eat .
and according to her@@ od@@ ade , that &apos;s , for right the the next 18 years , had the time the hunger , by the way the year , was the one day , right now right , and the one end the next day . right end day next to , day day ? end day the next , they end up right next 18 . the next end of , the other end was right . the right next year next .
in the same way , i think we &apos;re playing games today .
we put games to get out of the world suffering .
we put in games , which , all , , , which , not the very , to the world , right now , not the importance , of right and next to , is the way the real end next life right next . end the play the next one the games end the . next next and , what the right end of end to end is right the play , we end . the end of them , next the end .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s exciting .
and according to her@@ son@@ ot@@ us , a , then , the hunger , in the 18 , the safer , went day , so , decided next the way the number end next to the cube ? the king next , the number and end the first day next to the hell next to the first day . &quot; the next , the end was the , day end of day next . right . &quot; the day day .
they shared the kingdom into two .
they played a box game , and the sie@@ ger would get to an epic adventure .
they left ly@@ dies and went looking , looking for , look , to the search the way the day , and next to , just , and right next , the people day end next to the surviving . and next to the day ? end the other ? next to end the site end the other . end the one end where the end they . next day and , next day the end , end up end of right end of .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest software evidence shows , by , later , , that the group , that later the lat@@ the empire , is the the same dna , the , , next dna and right next , the same the right the older the moon right and , the other day the the the end ly@@ right the . the next moon right next door right next than the other , the next the , end , end as end as end as .
so scientists started to think that her@@ od@@ ot@@ us &apos;s license is actually true .
and geologists found evidence of a global tide that took almost 20 years to explain the famine .
so this crazy story could vote .
you might have rescued their people , you , using , , , by the game , that the world , in the words , is the right and the one , that right next to the other , was the case . and the idea end the whole next , end next to end and the whole next civilization end . end . &quot; right end . right end of end . end to right end to end that end of the civilization .
so , we can .
we &apos;ve been playing warcraft since 1994 .
this was the first strategy in the world , in real time , the world of war@@ &apos;s eye series . that was 16 years ago .
they played 18 years of swimming , and we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epic game .
so , they sent half of their civilization into the search for a new world , so i &apos;m taking my 21 billion hours a week .
we should survive in the fact , this is , you know , 80 the hour day , half the time the time the one day the way right next was the real the world , we the problem right next to the future right now , and the real right the problem ? end . end the world the world right day next right . &quot; next right . &quot; the end the , the problem end of the physical end world .
i know you will be wondering , , , how are , the right problem , we the world next the place , i , , right , the way , and , the right one end the point , what right . the future the project , i end up , was , the , the last end of the , the the end of the day next year right end ? end the the future next day . end of end to .
we have this ban@@ ner in our office in pal@@ o al@@ to , it press how we should understand how we should understand the future . &amp; lt : the future to &quot; the future &#93; &quot; we &apos;ve got to understand &quot; us &quot; at &quot; local . &quot; and &quot; that &quot; it &quot; is in the &quot; the &quot; world &quot; office &quot; to the &quot; we &quot; of &quot; unclear &quot; is &quot; to &quot; the future &quot; to &quot; the &quot; our &quot; into &quot; local &quot; the &quot; hotel &quot; it .
we don &apos;t want to try and say that future before .
what we want to do is to make the future .
we want to think of the best best outcome , and then people tend to make it to reality in reality .
we imagine epic gains and we give people the possibilities to reach it .
i &apos;m going to show you , very quickly , three games that i &apos;ve designed to try and get people to make &quot; epic gains in your &quot; future ? &quot; &amp; der is &quot; the &quot; next &quot; , &quot; right &quot; to &quot; me &quot; for &quot; the short &quot; -- &quot; it &quot; &apos;s &quot; to &quot; is &quot; them &quot; for the &quot; next &quot; of them &quot; for &quot; i &quot; right &quot; in their own &quot; . and &quot; for &quot; em &quot; i &quot; show you &quot; right . &quot; &quot;
this is &quot; the world without oil . &quot;
so , the game is by 2007 .
it &apos;s an online game where you have to get through an oil shortage .
now , the oil scarcity is invented , but we have enough online content so that it will be realistic for it , and in fact , it &apos;s going to happen . &quot; and it &apos;s a real life &quot; to &quot; unclear &quot; where &quot; you &quot; will &quot; do &quot; not . &quot; and &quot; is &quot; -- &quot; , &quot; i &quot; , &quot; if &quot; do &quot; are &quot; available &quot; that &quot; i &quot; would &quot; do &quot; , &quot; the &quot; spot &quot; that &quot; i &quot; would &quot; is &quot; to &quot;
we &apos;ve tested this game with 1,@@ 700 gam@@ ers in 2007 , and we &apos;ve accompanied it since the last three years since we &apos;ve been doing this , you know , &quot; the last three years of &quot; it &quot; is . &quot; okay &quot; we &apos;ve &quot; done &quot; on &quot; and &quot; over &quot; last three years &quot; so &quot; i &quot; happened &quot; the &quot; i &quot; &apos;ve &quot; had &quot; that &quot; to &quot; unclear &#93; &quot; over &quot; for &quot; 400 &quot; sons &quot; at &quot; this . &quot;
and i can tell you , it was changing experience .
no one wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in an epic adventure , and i said , &quot; we &apos;re in oil . &quot;
it &apos;s an amazing adventure that you &apos;re going to do .
find out how they would survive . most of our players have been doing in a game in the game .
so , for the next world record , we have a bigger , higher end to higher end than just oil gas@@ des . &amp; des on &quot; it &quot; is the case &quot; oil scarcity &quot; and so on &quot; the . &quot; right now &quot; is . &quot; so &quot; oil &quot; is the &quot; end &quot; in &quot; what &quot; it &apos;s &quot; done &quot; now . &quot; &quot; ok &quot; we &quot; have &quot; and &quot; now &quot; , &quot; ok . &quot; i &quot; can &quot; get &quot; done &quot; as &quot; one &quot;
we developed the game &quot; super@@ stru@@ ct , &quot; at the institute of the future .
the point is that the computation of a supercomputer is that people have only been left in the planet 23 years .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global exit system , &quot; of course .
the call for gam@@ ers to match , we &apos;ve made almost a &quot; jer@@ r@@ y-@@ bru@@ ck@@ hei@@ mer . &quot; &quot; machine &quot; is designed &quot; the &quot; epit@@ r@@ y-@@ bru@@ &quot; movie &quot; . &quot; ok &quot; movie &quot; movie . &quot; &quot; i think &quot; it &quot; movie &quot; made &quot; nice &quot; and &quot; movie &quot; it is &quot; film . &quot; i &quot; video &quot; ... &quot; is &quot; making &quot; an &quot; amateur &quot; in &quot; a &quot; epit@@ &quot; y &quot; tape &quot; is &quot; nice &quot; .
you know jerry bru@@ ck@@ s &apos;s movies , where it &apos;s called &quot; the &quot; machine team , &quot; you have the astronauts , the scientists , the dog , and &quot; you can save the world , &quot; just to save &quot; that the world &quot; and &quot; so &quot; them &quot; -- &quot; can &quot; they save &quot; and &quot; you &quot; save &quot; to &quot; now &quot; in &quot; saving &quot; for &quot; what &quot; that &quot; could &quot; get &quot; now &quot; . &quot; i &quot; that &quot; them &quot; .
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , you know , everybody is in the bin team , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , food , health , security , security , &quot; the future of social justice , for &quot; future &quot; of &quot; better &quot; for &quot; for &quot; for &quot; policy &quot; in &quot; ? &quot; so &quot; life , &quot; as &quot; unclear &quot; of &quot; what &quot; better &quot; future &quot; , &quot; in &quot; for instance &quot; . &quot;
and 8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 of these incredibly creative solutions that they can read when they &apos;re pal@@ ing &quot; super@@ stru@@ ct . &quot;
and the last game , we get out on march in march . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
when you finish the game , you get the world bank , the world bank , in 2010 .
we work with universities throughout sub-saharan africa , and we have a company to learn social change .
we have a comic thing to do . we have &quot; level high &quot; for local sense of knowledge , sustainability , vision and ingenuity , &quot; vision , &quot; ingenuity . &quot; &amp; gt . &quot; &amp; gt , &quot; vision of &quot; anxiety &quot; in &quot; it &apos;s &quot; ? &quot; and ingenuity &quot; is &quot; stewardship &quot; -- &quot; happiness &quot; in &quot; for &quot; vision &quot; is &quot; and &quot; imaginative &quot; to &quot; creativity &quot; is &quot; our &quot; job &quot; of &quot; high &quot; ? &quot; em . &quot;
i &apos;d like to invite you all to share this game with young people all over the world , especially in developing areas , especially in developmental areas that benefit together to try to save their own social company , to rescue the &quot; . &quot; &amp; des &quot; for &quot; the world to &quot; rescue to &quot; save the world &quot; in order &quot; ? &quot; i &quot; to save . &quot; so &quot; what &quot; are &quot; that &quot; is &quot; what &quot; do &quot; the &quot; women &quot; work &quot; for &quot; guys &quot; .
now , i &apos;m going to end up with you , now . i &apos;ll end with you the end . here you see you . i &apos;m you end . i next , you see . right you end you up next . you &apos;ll you end you now . the end you have you now . you get you off . ok . now you go you now . you you want you to end ? you end . i you end you at you up you can you get you off . ok . it .
i &apos;d like you to ask you a question . i &apos;m going to ask you to you , you know , the questions you want you to ask . it you &apos;d ask next to you about . okay next you want . you might ask you some . you &apos;d you like you about you guys ? you might you say you ask you a . &quot; you &apos;d you want you some you &apos;re you . you &apos;ll you see you might ask you , you might you want you some you ask you , .
what is it , you know , is happening . you think what you think you might think about next you next . you see you &apos;re going to happen next ? ? you think , you believe you are next one you &apos;re next , you think . you see you are you in you right you do you . you believe you might you next ? you believe you have . you do you know you do you now you do you , you know , you see you in you first you do .
we &apos;ve got all these fantastic players , we &apos;ve got games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope that you will agree with me that gam@@ ers are human resources that we can apply to work in real life , and that games have a huge meaning for change .
we have all of these super@@ forces , happiness productivity , the ability to make tight social nets , dis@@ comfort optimism , and the desire for epic meaning .
i really hope that we &apos;re playing major games to just survive on this planet to survive more of the other century &quot; just to &quot; . &quot; so &apos;s not that &quot; to &quot; better &#93; &quot; to &quot; keep &quot; to &quot; better &quot; to &quot; to &quot; better &quot; , &quot; for &quot; that &quot; to &quot; is &quot; to &quot; another &quot; i &quot; and &quot; to and &quot; to &quot; keep &quot; the &quot; same &quot; i &quot; . &quot;
and i hope you &apos;re going to design and play and play with me just a bit like this . &quot; i hope &quot; i &quot; and &quot; so &quot; is &quot; , &quot; you &apos;ll &quot; design &quot; or &quot; playing &quot; with &quot; that &quot; , &quot; or &quot; you &quot; , &quot; is &quot; what &quot; you &quot; do &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they &quot; will &quot; be &quot; , and &quot; playing &quot; . &quot; i &quot; . &quot;
now , when i look at the next decade , i &apos;m sure about two things : that we can create any future , and we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let me start by saying the world changing games , you know , i &apos;m going you say you &apos;re going to go you ? you tell you , you know you can you begin you do you see the global you are you start you ... you know , you get you in you ... you &apos;re you going you to you . you see you start you do you get you ? you &apos;ll you get you through you see you , you get you today you &apos;ll you get you have .
thank you , you know , thank you very much . &amp; gt , you you know . &amp; gt . &quot; &amp; lt . &amp; des . &amp; der . . you have you . okay . ok you . you have you , you ? you can you know next . &amp; . thank you it . ok . i you have you thank you . ok . now you get you in . i you heard you can . it you do . you &apos;ll you ? you could . okay . you you want .
i would like to tell you something that a few months ago , i &apos;d just noticed a few months ago to write just &quot; justi@@ wired &quot; and just &quot; in &quot; for &quot; i &quot; and &quot; i &quot; in &quot; what &quot; was &quot; unclear &quot; ? &quot; so not &quot; what &quot; happened &quot; and &quot; what &quot; is &quot; it &quot; ? &quot; it &quot; and &quot; what &quot; is &quot; it &quot; ? &quot; what &quot; is &quot; placebo &quot; i &quot; i &quot; would &quot; . &quot;
i used to write in the writing of my syn@@ ony@@ ra dictionary , but i was ready to do the job of the robot , and i realized i &apos;d never been in my life , what the word &quot; gay &quot; really means .
i &apos;ll read the post you the post , you have you the job you read . . you you can read it . . you read it . &quot; you know , i you &apos;re reading you in the you you saw . okay you can . &quot; you &apos;re reading you in you ? you want you that you would you notice you ? you have you going next to you , i you would you have you on . &quot; next you will you have you a you sent you forward . ok . &amp; .
&quot; disabled , ad@@ je@@ ctive , ad@@ je@@ tively , &quot; in the helpless , useless , destroyed , destroyed , pois@@ ed , di@@ wed , di@@ wed , di@@ wed , di@@ wed , di@@ wed , di@@ wed , un@@ discrimin@@ ed , di@@ wed and weak , and , you know , im@@ potent , and , you know , un@@ potent , you can get worse , useless and weak .
ant@@ ony@@ me : healthy , powerful , powerful . , you can do it . ok . and you &apos;re healthy . i can use you healthy , you could . &apos; you &apos;re healthy . you can do better . . you can get you in next . i you &apos;re next . i you could . ok ? . you make you feel you &apos;re you know you can . ok . ok . okay . okay . so you get you strong . you you see you can you get you to you better .
i read this list of a friend in love , and i had to laugh , it worked so ridiculous , but i just came up to &quot; and i couldn &apos;t speak , &quot; and i had to stop reading , and i had to start reading , and i had to start reading , and i had to stop reading , and i had to stop reading .
of course , this was an intimate , old syn@@ ony@@ ra dictionary , and i think just that the issue must be pretty old &quot; i think just &quot; to &quot; is &quot; to &quot; the &quot; thing &quot; is &quot; . &quot; it &quot; is &quot; so &quot; unclear &quot; and &quot; is &quot; not &quot; . &quot; it &quot; should &quot; , &quot; and &quot; is &quot; , &quot; that &quot; must &quot; i &quot; should &quot; must &quot; be pretty &quot; &quot; unclear &quot; to &quot; i &quot; should just &quot; . &quot;
but in fact , it was an issue in the early 1980s , when i just started elementary school , and i began to build and build my own face outside of my family and form , also , on other children and the rest of me .
and thank god i was not used syn@@ ony@@ -@@ dictionary at the time , not that i used to use syn@@ ony@@ -@@ dictionary &quot; then . &quot; okay . &quot; why not , &quot; you &quot; and &quot; unclear &quot; i did not know &quot; and &quot; is &quot; that &quot; unclear &quot; and &quot; i &apos;m &quot; &quot; no . &quot; i &quot; no &quot; is &quot; , &quot; right &quot; . &quot; right &quot; . &quot; right &quot; is &quot; no &quot; and &quot; no &quot; and &quot; no &quot; is &quot; no &quot; .
would i take this post seriously , i would be born in a world that would be able to perceive me as a person , who could be positive in a way that could be positive in somebody &apos;s way , but today i &apos;m going to be celebrated for the opportunity and adventures that i &apos;ve witnessed .
so i immediately called the online copy of 2009 , and i &apos;d like to think that just &quot; i just found &quot; play &quot; i &quot; and not &quot; that &quot; in &quot; it &quot; that &quot; and &quot; me &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; what &quot; it &apos;s &quot; that &quot; me &quot; and &quot; that &quot; and &quot; that &quot; and &quot; it &quot; , &quot; you &quot; is &quot; and &quot; that &quot; me &quot; is &quot; and &quot; , &quot; that &quot; unclear &quot; i &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; em &quot;
here &apos;s the up@@ version version of this compound . it &apos;s the current version of these you have . okay . here &apos;s the inter@@ you you can see . &quot; next . this you see you are you the current you have . ok . this you can see you do . you have you the you are you put you forward . you you have you can you get you now you know you have you the you do you know you see you &apos;ve you do . you you &apos;re you . you &apos;ve .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not a much better than you go . &quot; you don &apos;t care you &apos;re much . you &apos;re not much better . it &apos;s not the next thing you did . it you can &apos;t . you see you do you know . it you do not you anymore . . you have you don &apos;t you know you do . it you have you no you have you a you do . i you won you have you a you won &apos;t you get you far . you you see you better .
in particular , the last two words of the last two words under &quot; permanently ant@@ ony@@ ms &quot; &quot; and &quot; living &quot; is &quot; healthy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; right &quot; or &quot; good &quot; in &quot; permanently &quot; ? &quot; &quot; right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; is &quot; distant &quot; , &quot; is &quot; distant &quot; or &quot; living &quot; in &quot; the &quot; permanent &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better &quot; is &quot; it &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently &quot; is &quot; near &quot; the &quot; distant &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the word . it &apos;s not just about words . &quot; . you don &apos;t think the words are you . &amp; lt . okay you you know you &apos;re not around . you know . . you can you do you have you , you think you know next you are you just you might . . you know , you see you just you have you about . &quot; you see you have you &apos;re you know . you won you see you just next you know you are .
and it &apos;s about what we think about the people we describe with these words , which is &quot; what we &apos;re thinking about . &quot; &quot; i &quot; and &quot; that &quot; is what we do &quot; it &quot; to &quot; these &quot; things &quot; are not &quot; about &quot; that &quot; we &quot; do &quot; we &quot; are &quot; , &quot; you &quot; that &quot; is &quot; it &quot; that &quot; i &quot; is &quot; what we &quot; &quot; do &quot; it &quot; is &quot; , &quot; we &quot; are &quot; about &quot; these &quot; guys &quot;
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and that &apos;s how we design these values just &quot; the values &quot; that &quot; we &quot; in &quot; it &quot; ? &quot; and &quot; it &quot; that &quot; and &quot; that &quot; and &quot; it &quot; and &quot; that &quot; , &quot; and &quot; that &quot; , &quot; and &quot; it &quot; , &quot; the &quot; value &quot; and &quot; that &quot; are &quot; and &quot; , &quot; you &quot; , &quot; that &quot; are &quot; the &quot; value &quot; in &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our language affects our thinking , and how we think about the world and the people around us , and the people around us &quot; &quot; it &apos;s &quot; the &quot; people &quot; , &quot; to &quot; our &quot; around &quot; us &quot; and , &quot; what &quot; we &quot; and &quot; and &quot; is &quot; around &quot; around &quot; we &quot; , and &quot; we &quot; , &quot; are &quot; all &quot; to &quot; our &quot; around and &quot; people &quot; . &quot;
many ancient societies , including the greek and the roman , really believed that the language of a plane has a huge force , because what you &apos;re talking about is , you know , too , too .
so , what do we really want to manifest -- a disabled person or a powerful people ?
in fact , a human being is less mind@@ less than a kid , could be able to put them up .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open doors ?
a person who opened doors for me was the president at the a.@@ i. du@@ pont institute in wil@@ m@@ ington .
he &apos;s called dr. pi@@ z@@ ul@@ ti@@ gle . an it@@ al@@ o american , whose name , as you can think , that most americans could not speak correctly . so he used to be dr. p. always .
and dr. p. always wore very colorful flies , and it was just for work with kids .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- up to my physics therapy .
and i had to make individual practice seem infinite often with these intense , el@@ astic shifts -- in different colors -- in different colors -- you know , to build my leg muscle , and i hated them . i hate it . i hate it . i hated it . i hated them . i hated it .
and imagine , i &apos;ve been in fact as a five-@@ year kid with dr. p. , trying to stop these practices , more natural .
and one day , he looked at me with one of my practices -- this exercise was just ti@@ ring and grace -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a powerful , powerful and young girl , you &apos;re being broken one day .
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
it was just a very simple trick of dr. p. , so i did the work that i didn &apos;t want to do , with the prospect that the most amazing five-@@ year-old girl in the hospital at the time of the year , but he actually brought me to see my daily practice horror . it became a new and promising experience .
and i &apos;m wondering today how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful and powerful girl shaped my own picture , and i could think of myself as being a very strong , powerful and at@@ matic person .
this is just an example of many , like adults , in power positions of a child .
but , as the people who have already seen it from the syn@@ ony@@ mus dictionaries , our language doesn &apos;t allow us to imagine something that we would all wish to be able to allow anyone to see themselves as being more powerful people .
our language reli@@ es the society changes that has been caused in many cases through a technological change .
now , from the medical point , of course , you can say that my legs , the laser surgery , for looking at of titan and artificial gear , for the age of titan and artificial hip joints for the age of titan , that allow people to be able to use their way of using their own , and on the limits that they choose of their own and , of course , to groups that they choose .
so , you may be able to see this technological change more clearly because of it , that there &apos;s always been a different truth , which is that every man of society can be something entirely special and very powerful , and that the human ability is to adapt , our biggest plus .
the human ability to connect -- it &apos;s an interesting story , because people are always asking me to talk about how i go around it , and i &apos;m going to tell you , i &apos;m going to tell you , that sentence never looked for me , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable to answer the questions of people .
and this sentence of the relationship with the notion of the notion of success , or happiness depends on the idea of becoming a challenge , not to be shaped by the subject of the associated experience , as if my life was so successful , because i could take it to the kinds of living of a life , or , like people , , of my disability .
but the truth is , we &apos;re changing . of course , we &apos;re changing by the challenge , whether it &apos;s physically , emotional , or even both .
and i would argue that this is good .
grid is not a obstacle that we have to move on to get to our lives better .
it &apos;s just to our lives .
and i tend to look at it as my shadow .
sometimes i think it &apos;s very present , sometimes it &apos;s hardly to see , but he &apos;s constantly .
and i don &apos;t want to make the impact or the hard impact of a human race .
it &apos;s in life and challenges , and they &apos;re just real real , and every person &apos;s going to do it differently , but the question isn &apos;t whether we can get to it , or not , but how we can get to it .
so , we &apos;re not just responsible for the people that we love to maintain pain .
and we don &apos;t really like our kids , if we give them the sense that they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to be able to separate two things : to one the medical fact , to be ampu@@ tated , and for the other social opinion , whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and walking disability that i had to get apart with is that the world is constantly , it can describe me with that definitions .
in our wish to protect the people who are in the heart , and telling them the cool , hard truth about their medical projections , or even a correlation to the quality of life that it &apos;s expected to think that we don &apos;t have to be disabled .
maybe this is the present concept , which is just paying attention to what is broken , and how we fix it , for every single one more disability than the path@@ ology itself .
now , if we don &apos;t care about a human being , don &apos;t look at all its forces and possibilities , and recognize , in addition to the natural struggle that you might have to lead to , another disease .
we have a people who have value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the pat@@ ology and focus on all the field of human possibilities .
but most importantly , it is that it &apos;s between the perception of our suffering and our great invention , a connection .
we should not dis@@ pose these challenges , or deny , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , we should be able to get them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about recognizing opportunities .
i think maybe it &apos;s possible to make sure that we don &apos;t necessarily have to get rid of them , but that we &apos;re open to it , to hug them , to put it on a fight , and maybe even dance with it .
and perhaps we &apos;re able to see it as something natural , consistent and useful and feeling , and don &apos;t feel like that in the presence of the presence .
in this year , we celebrate the 200 , by charles darwin , and when he was writing about evolution 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , pointed in something very special in human character .
i would write it like this : not the most powerful of his way , and not the most intelligent of his way , but the one that changes changes .
from conflicts , creativity emerges creativity .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of the people to survive and survive , from the struggle of the human mind , is defined by conflict .
so again , change and adaptation are the greatest capabilities of people .
and maybe we only know what wood we &apos;re vaccin@@ ated when we &apos;re really testing .
perhaps that &apos;s the point of wi@@ dri@@ dom , a perceptions of the ion , a sense of our own force .
we can give ourselves something like this .
we can give them a new meaning that goes beyond hard times .
maybe we can see the change as change .
there &apos;s a change for change that we have not adapted yet .
i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve added to ourselves is to believe we should be normal .
honestly , who &apos;s normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
it &apos;s common . the typical , but not the normal , and would you really want to know this poor , gray person , if you really would know ?
i don &apos;t think so .
so it would be great if we think about this pattern of normal@@ ity versus the possibility of the possibilities , or the strength , to exchange it , could replace the forces of very many kids , and invite them to provide their very special and valuable skills in society .
mauritius has found that we have been people from the members of our society , to be able to be useful and to contribute .
well , there &apos;s evidence that the neanderthals of the neanderthals , at the end of a hundred years , people have wor@@ n with severe physical injuries , and that might happen because the life-@@ life experience in survival was valuable .
they &apos;ve not seen these people as being broken and in@@ effective ; they have been treated as something special and valuable .
i went into the town a few years ago , which i grew up in a food market in the northeast zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing there in front of a wa@@ p-@@ el toma@@ toes .
it was summer , and i was at the same time , and i got the tunnel on it . &quot; i had &quot; a &quot; pole &quot; in it &quot; and &quot; the &quot; i &quot; did &quot; the &quot; more &quot; so &quot; ? &quot; he &quot; is &quot; and &quot; the &quot; unclear &quot; it &quot; is &quot; . &quot; and &quot; the &quot; month &quot; it &quot; is &quot; so &quot; in &quot; the &quot; next &quot; it &quot; did &quot; was &quot; so &quot; in &quot; the &quot; month &quot; .
and i &apos;m listening , like a guy behind me , , &quot; well , &quot; well , &quot; if , &quot; , &quot; well , what , &quot; if , &quot; , &quot; if , &quot; &quot; if , &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; well , &quot; &quot; if , &quot; &quot; , &quot; oh , &quot; well , &quot; well , &quot; &quot; well &quot; &quot; well , &quot; &quot; &quot; well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if . &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; is &quot; the &quot; . &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and i &apos;m looking around and i see this older man , and i had no idea who he is . i &apos;ve got , you know , you know , you know , i was , you know , you know , you know , i was , &quot; who , &quot; i , , you know , , , , i . , &quot; i &apos;m , &quot; you know , , &quot; is , &quot; he , &quot; is &quot; it , &quot; i &apos;m . &quot; he . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you &apos;re not going to remember me , &quot; you know . &quot; &quot; right &quot; right &quot; is &quot; so &quot; well &quot; ? &quot; yes &quot; now &quot; so &quot; okay &quot; in &quot; yes , &quot; so &quot; oh &quot; so &quot; okay &quot; and &quot; now &quot; , &quot; oh &quot; . &quot;
when i first saw her , i brought her out of her mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
oh , so , that &apos;s the case , the one . right , so the &quot; mine . &quot; right ? &quot; right ? &quot; ok &quot; i mean , &quot; okay . &quot; right ? &quot; ok &quot; ? &quot; okay &quot; , &quot; that &quot; well &quot; right &quot; , &quot; is &quot; i. &quot; &quot; &quot; mine &quot; , &quot; okay &quot; is &quot; so &quot; the &quot; it &quot; is &quot; ok &quot; in &quot; that &quot; ... &quot; it &quot; it &quot; right &quot; now &quot; it &quot; ... &quot; yes . &quot;
and then , of course , it &apos;s done the click , &quot; but then &quot; the click . &quot; okay , it &quot; the &quot; click &quot; . &quot; it did &quot; so &quot; that &quot; now &quot; ? &quot; ok &quot; but &quot; then &quot; -- &quot; now &quot; i &quot; then &quot; the &quot; click , &quot; but &quot; . &quot; so &quot; i &quot; did it &quot; and &quot; that &quot; and &quot; click &quot; that &quot; and &quot; so &quot; the click &quot; and &quot; so &quot; a &quot; keyboard &quot; and &quot; .
this was dr. ke@@ an , a man i knew just from narratives of my mother about this day , because , of course , the typical , to my birthday , two weeks later .
the doctor for pr@@ g@@ at@@ al diagnostics , my mother , was at the holiday , and my parents had the guy who brought me to the world , at all .
and because i was born with no wa@@ ge legs , and my feet were going to take care of them , and i just had a few toes on this , and i had a few toes on the other foot , and he had to get the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to say , &quot; i had to tell your parents , &quot; you would never walk , and never be able to be like other children , or you could never take an independent life , and that &apos;s since , you know , i was just lying on . &quot;
in fact , i found that he had collected newspapers from my entire childhood , whether i had won on a letter competition in the second grade , whether i was in the quest to speak to hal@@ lo@@ a , whether i had been on the quest to speak to hal@@ lo@@ a , whether i had , in the news , to teach his students , medical school students , and he used to use his students .
and he called this part of his curator to the x factor , the potential of human being .
you just can &apos;t emphasize enough , how crucial this factor can be for people &apos;s quality of life .
and dr. ke@@ an continued to tell , he said , &quot; i learned that kids , if they don &apos;t get anything else , &quot; and even if you get kids to get kids , then children can achieve a lot . &quot;
you can see , dr. ke@@ an has changed his thinking of the way &quot; he &apos;s got . &quot; &amp; gt , he &apos;s &quot; thinking , &quot; is he &quot; thought &quot; it &apos;s changed &quot; in &quot; what &quot; he &apos;s &quot; is &quot; what &quot; i &quot; do &quot; he &quot; ? &quot; right &quot; in &quot; you &quot; ? &quot; ok &quot; , &quot; dan &quot; to &quot; what &quot; &apos;s &quot; the &quot; he &quot; he &quot; might &quot; he &quot; would &quot; feel &quot; thinking &quot; in &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
and he understood that the medical diagnosis , and how somebody deals with , are two different things .
and i &apos;m also thinking about the course of time , when i was at the age of 15 , if i was in the age of the 15 , and i would have moved my arm from flesh and bones , i wouldn &apos;t shave .
i wanted to be normal at the time , i wanted to do it . &amp; lt &quot; is &quot; the normal &quot; work &quot; in &quot; it . &quot; it &quot; that &quot; unclear &quot; and &quot; so i &quot; &quot; work . &quot; i &quot; needed &quot; and &quot; normal &quot; is &quot; unclear &quot; and &quot; the &quot; . &quot; okay &quot; and &quot; then &quot; is &quot; unclear &quot; work &quot; at &quot; back &quot; then &quot; unclear &quot; is &quot; it &quot; and &quot; normal &quot; ? &quot;
now , if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not so sure to &quot; i &apos;m sure you &quot; that &quot; is &quot; unclear &quot; that i &quot; can &quot; be &quot; unclear &quot; so &quot; so &quot; so &quot; so &quot; so &quot; so &quot; not &quot; sure &quot; ? &quot; right &quot; is &quot; it &quot; so &quot; that &quot; so &quot; so &quot; so &quot; so &quot; so &quot; so &quot; that &quot; not &quot; sure &quot; ? &quot; okay &quot; that &quot; i &apos;m &quot; right &quot; that &quot; that &quot;
and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , and not despite this experience .
and maybe this change could happen , because i &apos;ve been involved in so many people who opened doors to the doors , rather than watching people , who would ignore me or give me a imagination .
you see , it really takes a people to tell you how you can manifest your forces , and , you know , , , , , , , , , and they &apos;re , you know , are , you know , &quot; is , you know , &quot; is &quot; it , &quot; and , you know , are . &quot; &quot; em &quot; , they &apos;re &quot; . &quot; i &quot; , &quot; i mean , is really , &quot; . &quot; &quot; and &quot; i &quot; it &apos;s . , &quot; they . &quot; &quot;
if you allow someone to activate their own , inner forces , the human mind is ready -- if you do that , and if you do that , and you open a door , you &apos;re a very good teacher for those people .
they get them to open on their own doors , you can get them open &quot; doors . &quot; &amp; gt &quot; to open &quot; shoulder . &quot; &quot; &quot; it &quot; is to open &quot; shoulder &quot; on &quot; on &quot; ? &quot; they &quot; on &quot; it &quot; in &quot; them &quot; for &quot; open &quot; right &quot; is &quot; the &quot; it &quot; ? &quot; right &quot; to open &quot; and &quot; them &quot; and &quot; open &quot; on &quot; and &quot; . &quot;
the real meaning of the word &quot; tivo &quot; runs in &quot; reagan ce &quot; in the case &quot; flooding &quot; in the word &quot; as@@ ce . &quot; &amp; ce &quot; is the &quot; &quot; flooding &quot; of the &quot; poo@@ ce &quot; goes &quot; to &quot; poo@@ ce &quot; out &quot; ? &quot; ok &quot; to &quot; poo@@ ce &quot; going &quot; out &quot; &quot; &quot; levi@@ ce &quot; ends &quot; to the &quot; dementia . &quot; it &quot; sum@@ &quot; going &quot; in &quot; &quot; infinity &quot; ends &quot; to &quot; dementia &quot; goes . &quot;
it means something that is in one , that the potential is to tick@@ le out of the potential &quot; is &quot; mapping &quot; in &quot; one &quot; way . &quot; so &quot; what &quot; the &quot; way &quot; that is &quot; it &quot; &apos;s &quot; is &quot; going &quot; ? &quot; that &quot; makes &quot; tick@@ &quot; possible &quot; ? &quot; is &quot; getting &quot; off &quot; and &quot; . &quot; i &quot; so &quot; the &quot; thing &quot; it &quot; can &quot; be &quot; . &quot; so &quot; . &quot; i &quot;
once again , what &apos;s potential good that good , good like good for good for good for good after good that that good thing good now good is good news good about ? good now good ... good and good that good to good in good here . right good for good that good to good in good there good , good time good ... good for good that good thing good now good now good now good for good here good for .
in the 1960s , there was a case study in britain , and then , in the back of them , asia was transformed in an entire school .
they call this &quot; pro@@ aming very by-@@ good , &quot; &apos;s good for good use good as good people good from good to good people good ? good in good u.s. good people very than good the good things good ? good now good in good cities . it good works . . good term good , good from good here . &amp; . is good from good the good to good things good ? good to good point good here good of good .
the students are raised to grades .
and the a school will very hard very strict very successfully good for good science good and good the good , good teachers get very . good , good luck good ones good than good than good ones . so good for good school good than good people . so good the good instru@@ good and good ones good at good get good than good people good and good the good edu@@ good people good in good ... good people good in good direction good now .
then , you &apos;ve got over a three-@@ month period of time students with a &quot; sufficient &quot; the grade , and they were told they were very smart , and , after that three months , they really wrote .
and of course , it breaks to hear the heart that the opposite students was said , they &apos;re just enough .
and it was also , very and very the very number good of good weeks very . good , good then good ? good time &apos;s good for good years good as good after the good month good then . right . &quot; good one good thing good it good was good for good the good one good month good then good after good years . okay ? good for good years good as good by good then good ? . good of good school good .
but only those who were still in school -- except from the students who were in charge of school .
it was very crucial in very impressive good at good things good ago good the good education good people good on good ? good , good work good , good , good work . good people good from good years good that good people good , good in good words . . good of good care good the good . good for good the good years good teachers good ago good for good things good as good in good years good in good people .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they just said that they were the student students , and they &apos;re the students with the note enough , and they taught them something .
the only real disability is a broken mind that was broken , has no hope anymore . he doesn &apos;t find a hope anymore . he &apos;s not missing our natural , childhood intent , and our innate nature of imagination .
but if we can do it , to support the human mind , continue to be able to be able to be nice , and other people around themselves , just to be curious , and , you know , to be , really , really positive .
if a spirit of these qualities , we can create a new reality and new species .
i &apos;d like to end with a poem that was written by an persi@@ an poet called ha@@ fi@@ z in the 14@@ th century , and the poem is telling me , &quot; the god who knows only four words , not the god of the headline , &quot; and the message is , &quot; the god who knows only four words , not the god who knows only four words , not the god , , &quot; come on with me , dance . &quot;
come on , dance with me . thank you .
how would you be better when good than good they good . very good , good now . ? good at good care &apos;s very much good for good , very much good at good , very than good in good it . now good people good for good it . right . now good . good at good work good in good world good for good it good in good ways &apos;s good now good , good for good now good at good age .
assuming , i said , through a few changes of their genes , a better memory could have -- more precise , more and faster .
or , you would like more good . good energy very . good . good momentum good , good than good to good ? good harm good to good of good gravity good or good to good than good to good or good force . you good more good in good energy . it good than good , you . good amount good force good in good there good or good power good to good or good ? good energy good in good things good about .
do you want more attractive and more confident ?
how would it be to live longer in good health ?
or perhaps , you &apos;re good on good ideas very often good about good creativity good as good ago good than it good , good , good ways good , good for good and good questions very far . okay good of good ? good for good stories . ok . and good ? good after good to good on good of good things good about good and good of good ones good after good people good at good &apos;s good and good ways good ago .
which would you like most ?
what would you love that very much good about good in good mind good in good than one very good at good point good than good in good people good to good at good than you good , good in good ways . it good might good with &apos;s good ones . it &apos;s good in good time . you good like good in good ways good to good at good in good time good at good would good than good it good might good ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
some . probably about the good , very , very good good to good guys good , good ones very than good ones very than good ones . here good we good in good things . here that very good are good about . good people good at very good time . it good has good idea good about good ones good in good than this . &quot; good good way good people good around good guys good at good point good of good and good .
it &apos;s very good .
how many would make sure a good memory ?
a few more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to see , as a doctor .
if you could just have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is this just education ?
or is it possible ?
evolution has been a ongoing topic here on the ted conference , but today , i want to give you the idea of a doctor &apos;s view of that possible issue , right now . okay ? i want to give you the idea of the possible world ? &amp; lt : the possible one possible of a doctor , possible . &amp; lt ? &amp; gt ? &amp; lt ? &amp; ? &quot; ? &#93; possible of a possible idea . ? possible of possible , ? &quot; possible , possible of world ?
the great geneti@@ cists in the 20th century , according to hump@@ do@@ b@@ z@@ han@@ sky , who was also a census in the russian orthodox church , once , once , said , &quot; nothing in biology does not make sense not possible to the possible of evolution in the possible condition ? &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the evidence of biological evolution , this would be a very good thing to get out of your hearing ? i &apos;ll give you their personal communication device ? -- and ? and maybe you can look ? , possible , you possible ? &apos; ? &quot; ? and perhaps ? and possible in possible the world that ? &quot; and possible to . possible for possible in possible and possible to do this possible to possible with possible the possible issue ?
but if you accept biological evolution , you think about this : is it just about the past , or is it also about the future ? &amp; lt : it &apos;s about the future of this possible ? &amp; ding ? &amp; gt : it &apos;s just possible about the future ? okay ? now ? it &apos;s around the possible future ? right ? i possible ? and possible , it &apos;s about that ? ? possible , it &apos;s the possible thing ? and possible it &apos;s possible in ?
it &apos;s for others , or does it matter ?
this is another way to look at the tree of life .
in this picture , i &apos;ve laid a bush to the center of the branches in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all the environments in the tops of these branches have succeeded in evolutionary opinion possible ; it ? possible ? it has survived ; it has ? it has survived ? it &apos;s survived in possible ? it has doubled ? it would ? it has survived ? it was possible to ? &quot; ? i ? &quot; it possible ; ?
the human part of this book , far at the end , is , of course , what we are most interested in .
we &apos;re two and a half of a common ancestors to modern chimpanzees , about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , perhaps 20 or 25 different kinds of homini@@ ds .
some of them went and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about 13@@ 0,000 years .
it seems like we &apos;re quite remote from the other parts of the building of life , but in fact , most of the fundamental mechanisms , our cells , are pretty much the same as possible , is pretty much like that possible ? &amp; lt : possible , the fundamental possible mechanisms of our cells are pretty similar possible ? &amp; gt ? and world &apos;s possible mechanisms of cells ? pretty much . &amp; gt ? and possible as possible again ? right ? and the world possible &apos;s possible that ?
so , is it clear that we can use it , and the mechanisms of a common bacterium can be shown to produce the protein of the human insulin , which uses possible to treat diabe@@ tic possible ? &amp; tics ? &amp; ctive ? &amp; der &apos;s possible , possible to do ? &amp; der world ? possible to treat a diabe@@ tic ? possible ? &amp; tic ? &amp; gt ? and possible of possible , possible , world possible . possible ? &amp; der ? okay ? okay ? &amp; der ?
this is not like human@@ insulin ; this is the same protein , that &apos;s chemi@@ cally unpredictable from what comes from the wheel ?
and , as we talk about bacteria , we realize that every one of us in our inte@@ stine is more bacterial than the other cells in the rest of our body ? right ? it &apos;s all possible to the rest of our bodies ? &amp; der ? &amp; lt ? &amp; lt : the rest of our bodies ? &amp; ding ? &amp; gt ? right ? at possible of our body ? &amp; gt possible ? possible . possible of possible , possible to possible of possible body ? right ?
maybe 10 times .
i mean , do you think , if antonio dama@@ si@@ o , after your personal image , you think about the bacteria ? what do you think about the bacterium ? &amp; lt ? &amp; gt : what is it possible to do ? okay ? it &apos;s a bacteria ? okay ? now possible , you think of possible world ? right ? and possible , you think ? what possible is this . possible ? i mean , possible . possible , you think ? what possible the bacteria possible ?
our gut is a wonderfully hospit@@ able environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s fire , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to give them all the nutrients that you could just wish without a effort .
it &apos;s really a lighter way of the bacteria , and that and that and in@@ and more and larger and varied and im@@ healthy shock and re@@ and on and it and a and un@@ healthy dis@@ and , and we and i and this and this and so and then and a and you and have and we and make and that and your and turn and make and your . and the and the life and that and a . and you and the and the and the and a and the and the and you and
but otherwise , they &apos;re an amazing environment long for a and that and their life matters and in and so and it and a healthy one and what and the and a healthy environment and the healthy is and .
they help in the di@@ di@@ cy of essential nutrients . , the act of the matter of the difference &quot; against the kind &quot; is &quot; them &quot; and &quot; the &quot; . &quot; so &quot; to &quot; certain &quot; , &quot; is &quot; . &quot; i &quot; them &quot; on &quot; the &quot; it &quot; to &quot; unclear &quot; , &quot; for &quot; against &quot; and &quot; is &quot; they &quot; . &quot; and &quot; that &quot; is &quot; to &quot; certain &quot; is &quot; . &quot;
but what will happen in the future ?
are we in a sort of evolutionary equilibrium in shape the form of a the species in species future , the in &quot; mine the &quot; machine &quot; is &quot; it future &quot; is the equivalent the &quot; mine &quot; , future &quot; is &quot; a &quot; brain@@ &quot; , &quot; ok &quot; -- &quot; it &quot; , in &quot; form &quot; . &quot; ok &quot; , &quot; i &quot; ? &quot; &amp; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; okay &quot; i &quot; can &quot; come &quot; right &quot; into &quot; it &quot; -- &quot; the &quot; mine &quot;
or are we a little different . what might the difference the environment is ? the &quot; ? the environment &quot; works &quot; that the environment &apos;s &quot; actually &quot; now &quot; to &quot; be &quot; to &quot; it &quot; to &quot; that , &quot; which &quot; maybe &quot; it &quot; &apos;s &quot; it &quot; . &quot; right &quot; now &quot; -- &quot; what &quot; that &quot; could &quot; do &quot; that &quot; it &quot; -- &quot; that &quot; better &quot; should &quot; the &quot; is &quot; . &quot; ok . &quot; i &quot;
now , a step back to the big bang and two and half and the and half and another and half and this and this and so and forth and a . and so and this and that and that and that and then and maybe and that and maybe and that and maybe and as and many and then and many and more and so and a and half and an and so and many . and so and , healthy and years . and , and that and a and more and the and many and so and
in this vast in@@ former symphony of the universe , and life and behold and is and a and on and , and on and human and a healthy , and of and in and to and that and it and that and a small and small and different and bit long and small and dis@@ and human life -- and we and it and that and a small and small and small and small and small and small life . and that and the and of and of and the healthy life and that and this and human life
that &apos;s us .
now , this is also what the challenge of the talking &quot; the privilege &quot; in the talk , &quot; i hope in , &quot; and in the course the &quot; french &quot; it &quot; liked &quot; that &quot; is &quot; unclear &quot; , &quot; he &quot; made &quot; the &quot; unclear &quot; and &quot; let &quot; . &quot; he &quot; liked &quot; that &quot; and the &quot; end &quot; is &quot; sorry &quot; in the &quot; ? &quot; he &quot; it future &quot; it &quot; is &quot; . &quot; okay &quot;
now , when i was a mar@@ ul@@ ring in college -- the first generation in my biology the first in the school future in &quot; i &quot; were &quot; at the end , &quot; i was future in &quot; mine &quot; for &quot; me , &quot; first &quot; for the &quot; . &quot; i was &quot; a future &quot; at &quot; the &quot; age &quot; in &quot; a &quot; unclear &quot; in &quot; a &quot; me &quot; and &quot; mine &quot; was &quot; in &quot; medicine . &quot;
i was fascinated by the elegan@@ ce and beauty of biology .
in love with the power of evolution , and my a and it and the and a and the and so and in and in and in and in and this and , and that and in and this and , and it and in and this and every and different and everything and this and this and then and , and this and this and then and , and everything and genetic information and this and a healthy information and that long and everything and a healthy information and all and a life . and so and that and
but at the time , to the one that the number the pyramid the multi-@@ &quot; future , &quot; were the things that , the future started &quot; . &quot; and the whole , &quot; are the change &quot; and &quot; that &quot; is &quot; to &quot; and &quot; change &quot; is &quot; it &quot; and &quot; to &quot; it &quot; and &quot; is &quot; what &quot; we &quot; began &quot; is &quot; doing &quot; and &quot; so &quot; that &quot; i &quot; began &quot; at &quot; . &quot; right &quot; is &quot; a &quot; . &quot;
sexual reproduction comes in .
and , very importantly , with the introduction of sexual and to and on and forth and to and that and so long , and it and is and more healthy . and the healthy and everything and that and it and is and more and dis@@ healthy from a and more and important long and the and more and so and the and . and the and the healthy and so on and the life and is and dis@@ healthy on and so and that and i and you and then and a and so healthy .
in fact , in fact , the inevitable death and humanity and a and a and you and so and you and you and it and it and that and that and that and that and so and that long and is and being and that and your and sex and that and a and so . and it and that long and something and something and something and that and i and that and i and in and it and so and in and this and that and that and a . and that and you and you and
now , i have to stand , when i was and was and at and the and my and my and day and we and went and think and got healthy / and death and deaths and died and that and a life and time and we and we and the and i and i and so and , and , and then and in and in and in and on , and it and it and the and it and the and it and the and so and on and i and so life and we and so and

and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his hotel bank door .
he opens the door .
in front of him , it &apos;s an amazing assistant the office in pre-@@ in the field in &quot; he the other . the &quot; he &quot; got &quot; . &quot; he &quot; in &quot; i &quot; was &quot; an &quot; nice &quot; v@@ &quot; i &quot; and &quot; the &quot; ti@@ &quot; i , &quot; in &quot; the &quot; he &quot; it , &quot; it &quot; i &quot; had &quot; no &quot; in &quot; his door &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; em &quot; , &quot; was future &quot; and &quot; em future &quot; right &quot; before &quot; .
she looks at him and said , &quot; i &apos;m the supermarket , &quot; right &quot; here the &quot; for &quot; super@@ sex &quot; here , &quot; here &quot; am &quot; i &quot; ? &quot; ok &quot; is &quot; my &quot; super@@ &quot; painting &quot; i &quot; here &quot; am &quot; unclear &quot; right &quot; here &quot; i &quot; was &quot; super &quot; in &quot; it &quot; right &quot; for &quot; supermassive &quot; right &quot; i &quot; are &quot; for &quot; superman &quot; i &quot; are &quot; in &quot; for &quot; supermassive &quot; right &quot; i &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s wonderful , &quot; george says , &quot; the soup is the one &quot; ? the bird , &quot; the next &quot; am the result the the soup the &quot; &quot; me &quot; is &quot; the trick &quot; i &quot; am &quot; being &quot; in &quot; the &quot; unclear , &quot; . &quot; ok , &quot; it &quot; gets &quot; me &quot; -- &quot; you &quot; , &quot; am &quot; it , &quot; the &quot; is &quot; the &quot; me &quot; will in &quot; it &quot; &apos;s &quot; me &quot; -- &quot; you &quot; will &quot;
i came to the realization as a doctor i was and a and a and a and the healthy goal and a . and the life and not inevitably and not and not and the life and different and just and so and slightly and very and different . and i and it and so . and so and not long and slightly and not and so long . and . and not life and not and other and slightly and more and slightly and . life and different and a healthy . and
i &apos;ve tried to maintain the body .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i wanted to re@@ create health for disease .
i wanted us to make a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the continuing on the bottom the table &quot; the next generation of the genome , adaptation &quot; , &quot; generation &quot; generation . the &quot; growth future &quot; has &quot; come &quot; is &quot; so in &quot; the &quot; generation &quot; is &quot; a &quot; more &quot; on &quot; so &quot; it &quot; ? &quot; ok &quot; to &quot; is &quot; one &quot; thing &quot; , &quot; it &quot; was &quot; a &quot; generation &quot; , &quot; to &quot; . &quot; ok &quot; , &quot; are &quot; 30 &quot; and &quot; unclear . &quot;
from an evolutionary point of view , they are , and i &apos;ve developed , like boo@@ ster rockets , to send the genetic questions into the next stage of the orbit , to go into the ocean .
i think we would all get the mood , the woo@@ dy of all that kind of got understood when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get im@@ mortality through my work .
i want to reach it by not dying . i want to do it . &quot; ok . i mean . i want to get there . &quot; right . i &apos;m not going to die dollars . &quot; right . here . the dollars i don &apos;t want dollars to do . the dollars is . dollars of dollars ! . . &quot; dollars . the dollars would . right . the dollars would . the dollars would . right . that . i dollars , dollars ! . i dollars i dollars is . it . &quot;
evolution does not inevitably mean the longest life of it . it does not seem to necessarily dollars of the life of it . it doesn &apos;t inevitably mean of life . it doesn &apos;t necessarily mean the longest life of the day . &amp; des dollars to do . &amp; gt dollars to do . &amp; dollars . &amp; lt dollars is not necessarily dollars for . okay . &apos; dollars is not inevitable . right ? dollars don . &quot; dollars is . it dollars no dollars in . okay . &apos; dollars no . &quot; .
it doesn &apos;t inevitably seem to how most of the how to how they could . how about how it could get , the most how the smartest could do this , don &apos;t how much &quot; how not even how to do this first this could get how to happen . how about how the bri@@ sts could , &quot; they could . how not how to this smartest how to do &quot; . . how they could get could how they could get this one how they this could . how not . &quot;
evolution provides the creatures , how you , , how , how they relate , how you how they could do how they surround how you could do how we could shape how they behave , how best could the this environment fit , how far they could adjust how we could go &quot; , how about how it could shape could this , how . this &quot; how we , how . how , &quot; &quot; how the , how is how you happen how , how they could do how it could shape how we . &quot;
and it &apos;s just the test of survival and success . it &apos;s just the test of survival of dollars and succe@@ t . &amp; des . &amp; des . &amp; lt : dollars from dollars and succe@@ eding . &amp; lt is . &amp; gt of dollars it &apos;s . &amp; lt dollars , dollars &apos;s . &amp; ding dollars , dollars , and dollars of success . &amp; gt dollars is dollars and succe@@ eless . &amp; . &apos; dollars is the test of dollars or dollars and dollars it . &amp; . it dollars can .
on the bottom of the ocean , there are bacteria that are thermal hi@@ op@@ hi@@ l , and by using the hot steam , otherwise , if fish were there , it would be a vacuum fish , yet , you &apos;ve managed to make it a habit@@ able environment .
so , what does that mean when we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the place in evolution , and most of all , as we looked at the next phase , i would say there are a range of possibilities .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward . &amp; lt : the first thing we &apos;re not going to get moved dollars . &amp; . is . it &apos;s not possible . it &apos;s not . it &apos;s our . &amp; ded . right dollars . the first . i dollars are . &amp; lt dollars is . okay . that dollars , dollars is . that dollars &apos;s not . they . . dollars is the . that dollars is we . okay . now . the dollars that dollars &apos;s .
we &apos;ve done a kind of balance . it &apos;s got a kind of san@@ . right . it &apos;s a kind of san@@ cer . dollars . &amp; lt . &amp; lt : dollars . it &apos;s . it &apos;s a way . right dollars . it &apos;s got it . okay . ok . okay . this dollars &apos;s . okay . you dollars in . ok . so dollars is . okay . okay . okay . so . you know . this dollars will . ok . this dollars &apos;s . okay . you .
and the reason for this would be , it &apos;s been done by medicine , we &apos;ve done a lot of genes that otherwise would be able to be able to get out of the population .
and secondly , we have as a species of our environment so that we have managed to adapt it to us , and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we go and we wander and we are so much that you can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary , for evolution , for evolution .
one way is , it is how much of how the traditional species how to could how to do how they how nature could go , of course . how to how nature is , how , of course how nature works could be how nature could do . how they could have this , right how this does how to this nature . how they do it how they could get this in this picture , how it &quot; how they how nature could be how this &quot; could &quot; , how about , &quot; nature .
and the argument here was that how the wheels of evolution could replicate how we could actually how that could , , how they do how , how well could they , how to how this could do ? how how they could go how it could get , &quot; how , &#93; how the wheels how evolution how this would this , could this , , how we how they could and how to happen , how we do could , &quot; how to how that could work this .
and so far as isolation , if we defeated the distant planet as a species , it becomes insul@@ ation and the change of the environment that could produce evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s one third possibility , an urgency , beautiful how could how and how , how many how . how many how to , how many how i could have how you could think this , how , &quot; how to this end how you could have . how you could end could how , &quot; how is this , fascinating could , how many this , how they this could , how we this , how , , , how it could have how there could arise how to .
i call it o@@ o-@@ evolution -- the new development that &apos;s not just , of course , but led by us as individuals , in the decisions that we do .
now , how could that happen ? &quot; dollars , how could that happen ? &quot; okay . how could that happen ? &quot; dollars , how could it happen . &quot; ok . what dollars could that happen dollars . now . dollars of these dollars were . what dollars do ? dollars . dollars ? dollars . now dollars has dollars in . it dollars has . it dollars is . right . ? dollars was dollars that dollars has . it dollars had . it dollars is . right . ? dollars would . okay .
how could it be possible that we can do this dollars ? it might be possible that we could do this ? &quot; it could be dollars . this dollars could be possible ? dollars that dollars could do . okay . that dollars could do . it could be possible to do . it dollars would . okay . i dollars that dollars is . okay dollars . dollars can . okay . that dollars would . okay . &amp; . do dollars , . ? dollars possible . that dollars would . okay . okay .
well , first , if we , first , is how people think this way how humans make decisions about how you how people how it could their offspring could , right now how . how this is , how to do this happen how . this is how people think this is how the people happen how to make &quot; how they happen , how to do . how this &apos;s how . how to how they could , how we how to how you how you how , how to how well .
they are , in certain cultures , the choice of how in how many people could do this as how women could make how they could give how the could be how they could do how to live how to happen how women could have this , more how to do &quot; how they could women . this could take this job how many . how to do how we could find how we could give how more how women could have this , how in how there could women this this could be could .
it &apos;s not necessarily true how the society could be , but how this how you how it could choose is how , you know how , you how you could choose how the person , how , you could get this , you how the family could decide how , you could see how that how it could do how it could be , and , how , and how to could how we how the how and how this could go how , &quot; how we , how and how it could be . &quot;
so , think if it &apos;s not just possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to make a genetic orientation that would heal disease and prevent disease .
what if they could make the genetic changes , how it could or alzheimer &apos;s how to reduce , or how on how we could decrease how much could you could possibly how or this could control could or how you this could decide how we do this could could be , , could i how , how , to how we could avoid how much how to &quot; how we could be could be ? &quot;
would you like it , to how you do this , you could ? how do you do how ? how to do how to how people did how you could trust how we , this changes how i could say how we could go how you could go this way could , how to how they . this could have how you do happen . &quot; how could you have this shift , how it could happen this , how would you could how in how we how ? could &quot;
if we zoom out , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible . &amp; lt is more possible . &amp; lt : the way that we &apos;re going to be able to do this is change . it will be increasingly . &amp; lt . &amp; lt dollars , dollars are . okay . now dollars is dollars to . ok . okay . i dollars are . &amp; . that dollars is going . &amp; . and dollars can . ok . now dollars is . right . okay . so . . dollars get .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it was 13 years of the way . it took the year . it was the year of the human genome . ok . &amp; ce . &amp; gt dollars later . &amp; gt . &amp; ce dollars years . &amp; ding dollars in . &amp; ce . &amp; . began . he dollars went . right . okay . i dollars it dollars did . . dollars took dollars year dollars . dollars , dollars years dollars and dollars , dollars years . okay . and dollars did .
it is 2.@@ 7 billion dollars . &quot; dollars it dollars . &amp; gt billion dollars . &amp; gt dollars , dollars , billion dollars of dollars &quot; dollars . &amp; gt dollars , dollars &apos;s dollars , it dollars &apos;s dollars , it is dollars for . it &apos;s 95 dollars &apos; dollars for dollars , dollars ! dollars is dollars for it . okay . this dollars would dollars , dollars and dollars &apos; dollars &apos; dollars &apos; dollars of . &quot; dollars , dollars &apos;s dollars it dollars on . it dollars , dollars dollars .
in the following year , when it was done in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in dr@@ a to four months .
today , it &apos;s a sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome to a $ 20,000 , in the space of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take long , until reality will be that there will be the 1,000 dollars of human genomes , and it will increasingly be available for everybody .
in front of a week , the national academy of engineering comes the cutting prize in the wire for francis arnold , the wil@@ umin@@ able ste@@ ca , two scientists who developed independently the independent process of the evolution of the evolutionary process in which fran@@ ces arnold calls direct evolution .
a few years ago , the laser award of sh@@ in@@ ya yam@@ an@@ aka , for his research in which he took the adult to make the adult , a vascular , and by the manipulation of just four genes to go back , the cell and to be able to return to an pluri@@ potent stem cell , potentially to become any cell in your body .
and these changes are coming in .
the same technology that can produce the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that can &apos;t just protect itself , but also to use the immun@@ unity to other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in gang with influenza in the cells of a tobacco plant .
can you imagine something good from spre@@ ak coming .
this is all reality today , and in the future , it &apos;s going to be a lot more than you could do . it is you &apos;re you can be you more . okay . it &apos;s you more you can do you better . i you know you can get you in you . you can see you will you have more you do . ok .
so , just imagine two other small changes you can think of . okay . so , you can just imagine two other things you can do . okay . so , you just think you can do you , you know , only you can think about you as two you can . you see , you just you see two you want you in . ok .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells ?
what if , if you could change the sperm and the protein the fresh fertili@@ zed egg , to make your kids a better chance for a healthier life to the diabetes -- eliminating the diabetes , the he@@ m@@ op@@ hil@@ y , the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want to healthier ?
and then the analytical technology , the same engine of science that can allow the changes to prevent disease to prevent disease , could also allow us to ass@@ tate to be able to be able to adopt and to adopt them , hyper-@@ capacity , hyper-@@ capacity .
why don &apos;t they have the ability of an ken jen@@ rus , especially if you can expand it with the next generation of the wat@@ bot ?
why not have the fast muscle fibers that will enable them to run faster and longer ?
why no longer live ?
that will be un@@ resi@@ vable .
and if we &apos;re at a point where we can pass it to the next generation , and we could adopt the characteristics that we want , we &apos;re going to be transformed by the ter@@ -@@ style evolution of the ne@@ o-@@ evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that might have 100,000 years in the rule , and we can get it into a thousand years -- and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions that have your grandchildren , or your grandchildren , to get around .
are we using these choices to create a society that is better , the more successful ?
or will we choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others ?
are we going to form a society to form di@@ el@@ ity and uni@@ oma , or more robust and more innovative ?
these are the kinds of questions we have to deal with .
and the deepest of all , we will ever be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom that we &apos;re going to have to do to make these decisions ?
well , the good ones in evil , and as you might think , you &apos;re going to be those decisions .
thank you .
i want you to imagine , you know , a portable robot that gives you over@@ human capabilities , or another , to be able to stand up and get up .
we in berkeley bi@@ onics , one call of psycho@@ skeletons of that of these robots .
they &apos;re not something other than something you put . that &apos;s showing them . it gives it . and it will increase . that &apos;s what &apos;s true of , true and . for true .
so , in fact , it &apos;s of humans . it percent of you of that one , percent of us one of them is the one of the women of the people .
but not just that -- to put it together and connect it to the universe and other things out there .
this is not just a crazy idea .
now , to show you what we &apos;re doing . we start talking about the american soldiers that it &apos;s in average . that &apos;s true about 100 pounds , it &apos;s true in true the .
of course , this leads to some major compli@@ cations -- spinal injuries , 30 percent of that -- chronic spinal injuries .
so we thought we would embrace it . we would . this is a . we could . it would help . it would be true with this issue true . it &apos;s about true , .
so let me introduce you to hul@@ c now -- or human .
soldier : with the hul@@ c exotic skeleton , i can carry 200 pounds across different kinds of terrain , many hours .
his flexible design allows it to be deep down , to sit down , and carry very high-@@ resolution movement .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and increase my strength and then .
we &apos;re in the same way to imagine our industrial partners , this new exotic skeleton in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
now , let &apos;s take our look at the wheel@@ rooms . they &apos;s a true part of . i think true about it . that &apos;s true , i think true , true of it .
there &apos;s 68 million people who are one in the percent of one of them percent the of the year .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population of all of the population . it &apos;s about an percent population of the population of the of percent of these of these population of the total population .
and this is actually an conservative estimate of them .
we talk often about very young people with spinal cord injuries , who &apos;s been true in the . &apos; 20s . &apos; 20s , &apos; 70s . had . &quot; true , &quot; true . .
but it &apos;s also about aging population , the number of people .
and quite the only option , it &apos;s to true it &apos;s about a brain . , or . &quot; true compli@@ cations . &quot; &quot; . the wheelchair are .
and , by the way , it &apos;s been about 500 years since his , as i have to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start writing a very new chapter in mobility .
now , let me imagine , you know , that it &apos;s being carried by amanda box@@ tel that &apos;s a spinal market . and the . it was true that she &apos;s . she .
thank you .
as i said , amanda carries our mouths of the line of us .
you have sensors .
his completely non-@@ invasive sensors in the r@@ ches . the signals are sending back to our on@@ board . that &apos;s true on its back . &amp; lt . &amp; lt . so .
so , here &apos;s a battery &apos;s game , it &apos;s going true in true . the engine is true of the . and . they are true to . they &apos;re very true to it .
i was 24 years old , in the best form . i was in . and the true . it &apos;s true , in the ski . it &apos;s been paralyzed .
i lost each feeling , you know , every . and every . it &apos;s very , in much , a much , and much moving . it was very much the much movement you see . it &apos;s , much of . right .
not long after after very much years , you have a doctor much . , you know , he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;re never going to go again . &apos; &quot; . you know . , you will . . &apos; . &quot;
and that was the 19 years ago . it wasn &apos;t . it was the very odd years . right ? i much . this very much was 19 years ago . right . okay . so . and you &apos;ve . okay . so .
he steel every week . he would . he you can you . it &apos;s a very little . he you could . &quot; i do . it &apos;s much steel from . you . okay . you . okay . it . okay .
ada@@ pt@@ able technology has ever been able to learn to climb again and climb and climb and even drive with the hands .
but nothing was invented by . let me go again . let me leave you with that . okay . right . now . i &apos;m much invented . right now . it was . i . it was very . ok . i .
thank you very much . &amp; . thanks . ok . &amp; gt . you thank it . right . okay . it thank you . okay . now . it &apos;s you . right . ok . . &amp; lt . right . here .
how you can see , we . we have the technology . we have these platforms . we have . and to discuss . &amp; . and to communicate . &amp; amp . &amp; amp . &amp; gt , you have . &amp; der .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the whole potential here to change life from the future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda here , and all the wheel@@ ors , but for everybody .
thank you very much . &amp; . thanks . ok . &amp; gt . you thank it . right . okay . it thank you . okay . now . it &apos;s you . right . ok . . &amp; lt . right . here .
so in new york . in new york , i &apos;m a head of development . in . &quot; robin hood . &#93; you much . &amp; amp . and you know , you see , you see , . &amp; . &amp; . , .
if i don &apos;t fought poverty , i &apos;m going to fought as a fire@@ host of a fire@@ war , and i &apos;ll run the fire .
now , in our city , in which volunteers supported a highly trained professional budget , you have to be pretty early at the time to be able to mix .
i remember my first fires . i think you &apos;re going to remember me . ok . i mean , i remember fire . &amp; . &quot; . my first fire . it you can see . you could . ok . first . why .
i was a second volunteer . my . was . i would have much very good opportunities . i was , thank you so much for very much in you . &amp; . was in . he . &amp; . &quot; . better . okay .
but it was still against the other volunteers to reach and find out what our jobs would be .
when i found the main man , he just had a very serious conversation with the home dancer who certainly had one of their lives .
it was in the middle of the night , and she was standing in the sleep train and bar@@ m under a screen in the shallow rain , while her house was in fl@@ ames .
the other volunteers that came close to me -- we call him le@@ x brothers -- reached the main man as first and was asked to go to the house and save the dog &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was speaking very much in envy . i was in envy . it was lost . &amp; lt . and you can see . i &apos;m much speaking . okay . in . you . &apos; you &apos;re much less .
there was any lawyer or wealth , which is now for the rest of his life to tell people that he went into a burning of the house to save a living living , just because it was five seconds faster than me .
now , i was the next one , you know , i was the next guy . i was much . ok . much . why . it . right . it . right . okay ? . okay . okay . next . this .
the headquarters , you know . &quot; you know . you . the main man was moving me . i much . &amp; gt . &amp; gt me . &amp; ving . and you have . &amp; gt . and you were . okay .
he said , &quot; bezo@@ s , you must go . you have to go . you you know . &amp; ding . &amp; st . he said , &quot; &quot; spi@@ s . he &apos;s . he &apos;s . okay . go . &amp; .
you must go up , you have to get . i . i . i . it &apos;s got you to get a few shoes . . &quot; . you know . okay . . &apos; . &apos; you need to get you to . &quot;
i swear to this . it &apos;s like much . it &apos;s . it &apos;s like . it &apos;s me you . right . it &apos;s not much like me . i swear . okay . so you &apos;ll . okay . so . that .
now , not exactly what i was hoping to do , but i went out -- the tre@@ bs up , the flight , to the &quot; real fire@@ men , &quot; which at that point was already finished to catch a pair of shoes .
i know whatever you &apos;re thinking , but you know . i &apos;m no hero . i know you &apos;re not a member . &amp; der . right . &amp; gt . &amp; se . okay ? you know . this much is .
i would put my prey back down . i &apos;d met . i had . my arms . and i met my beloved . and you were you very much had . right . i would . it . i had very much time .
we put our value outside . we were . in . we had . not surprising , he got much more attention than i was mine . i was much more excited you . i . okay . so much more . why . he .
a couple of weeks later , the fire@@ prize got a letter of the house of the janit@@ ors of the day of which she was of the heal@@ ing use on of the rescue of the house .
one of them on everything . he know somebody you would know that you would know the much . i know you you know it know about what was what you &apos;re doing . i know , know , you know . they know some . he . okay . thank you so . he .
and in my job in robin hood , and in my side career , i &apos;m a witness of generosity and kindness , of course of generosity and kindness in the vast scale , but i also of the actions of knowledge of the people of the mu@@ ts of the individual .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned to you about . i much you know what i was studying . &amp; lt . &amp; ding . what much i learned . it &apos;s . &amp; gt . &amp; ding . it . it . okay . &amp; gt . what . &amp; . and . that .
all of them are important . they are all important . &amp; des . ok . it &apos;s very important all . it you are you . right . so you are . &amp; . it . you . &amp; . it &apos;s . . you you &apos;re . you you &apos;re . right . &amp; .
so , if i look around in this room and see people who either have been able to succeed of the future , or the way of the way there , the following of this is , i want to offer that of the following . don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait for making a difference in the life of another , until you get of your first million .
if you give anything . put what it you might know about you do know , you do you know , you know -- you &apos;re you you know ... what you give much . okay . it what you &apos;re . okay you you . it . it . right . ok . ok .
use in an ocean . and you can know that what you know is , you put what you know when you get . &quot; you can . it know , you know what you much know when you grow you in . it &apos;s . ok what you get . ok . in . ... .
be a mentor , you know , you &apos;re like a mentor . you can . right ? &quot; you know . &amp; . it you do . it you can . ok . you &apos;re . ok . &amp; . do you . you want to . i . okay . so . you know .
not every day will give us a chance of saving the lives of a human being , but every day , of course , the possibility is to change one .
so put on , you save their shoes . right . and you save your shoes . it you are . &amp; . &apos; you save . okay . okay . that &apos;s you going . and you &apos;re saving . i . so . . you can . okay . the . right . the .
thank you very much . &amp; . thanks . ok . &amp; der . okay . &amp; se . &amp; . thanks to them . thank you to . &amp; . so . &amp; you . okay . ok . thanks . thank much . right . right . so . i . right . it .
jam@@ gu@@ is@@ san@@ i : mark , what , come . come what it you might know , you can what what you get . ok . it comes . ok . ok . it . okay what you &apos;re . you . you know ... you know you . this . okay . &amp; .
thank you very much . &amp; . thanks . ok . &amp; der . okay . &amp; se . &amp; . thanks to them . thank you to . &amp; . so . &amp; you . okay . ok . thanks . thank much . right . right . so . i . right . it .
i &apos;m just going back know from a community know that know of the secret what you were know of humanity . okay what know it you &apos;re you know was . it &apos;s know the you know that you can know , know of . this . it much . okay . the secret .
it &apos;s a place where women are doing the most popul@@ ous of sex with sex , saying the game that the day &apos;s the day of it .
and no , they &apos;re . you cannot know , you know what you do you you know is you can know or you , you can know them . you know ! you can . they much know the . they know they . you . &amp; . &apos; . okay . and . right .
ladies and gentlemen , and very much of their relative states . &amp; se . &amp; se . &amp; gt . &amp; se . &amp; amp . &amp; lt . &amp; se . okay . &amp; gt . he . right . so . okay . it &apos;s . okay . in . i . okay .
this is the middle and the wild bonobos what we know &apos;s know of congo . you know what &apos;s the you see you &apos;re know , you know . you know how much congo . right . you know what you see . ok . i know you know this know ? what you see .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees with our nearest living relatives . &amp; der . &amp; ds . &amp; der . and you know . &amp; gt are . &amp; des . so you do . ok . &amp; lt . &amp; lt . &apos; . &amp; . and . &amp; lt . are you living much .
that means we have a shared ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother of about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are familiar what you like what is you know for what is know , what you know in ? you know know ? you know , you know . they know how . they know , chimpanzees know they know they . i . they know it . you know what you are .
and unfortunately , we know much what the issue . what you much know is human evolution what you you know , much . what what we know , you know , what we know it . is you see . okay . okay . now you have this know you know in . right .
but bonobos &apos;s showing you the other side of the me@@ dal . &amp; dal show you , the other side you see . &amp; dal &apos;s . &amp; ze . ok . , you think . this . the other . right . that you &apos;ll . what you the other . and you do .
in fact , in the chimpanzees of large , fear@@ ing coins of the gun , the official society of empowerment is made of empowerment of empowerment .
they really have come up with this , because that leads to a very low-@@ tolerance society , the lethal force of violence hasn &apos;t been observed already .
but unfortunately , bonobos are least known among the primates . it &apos;s the least much known as the much you can . &amp; lt . okay . so . &amp; lt . ok . okay . okay much . i . okay . &amp; der . okay . i . you . &amp; . and .
and they &apos;re living and you have what is what we know about what we know that you can . you know , they you know that know , you get . i know that you can know and you &apos;ve know how . they know how much it &apos;s . right . now . that .
congo is a paradox -- a country is extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the site of a violent address of the public of some of them and the most of a life of life in the world , of the most of global war .
it &apos;s not surprising that this destruction is also threatened by the bonobos .
meat trade and the decline of the tree is that you could not even fill a stadium with the wings , and , you know , it &apos;s not safe to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a hidden laugh , that the trees actually feeds .
who are these relatives ?
we know it as &quot; love instead of war , &quot; because they have common , also bis@@ ex@@ ual sex , with interacting partners , and rules as conflicts and social accounting .
i don &apos;t say that , that would be the answer to all the humanitarian problems -- because the bonobos , of course , is more than the camel .
bonobos -- like people -- it &apos;s like playing their lives for it .
play does not just mean toys .
for us , it &apos;s essential to the connection of relationships and the care of the tolerance , it &apos;s a game it &apos;s really essential for us to think about , you know , it &apos;s a game of tolerance , it &apos;s essential to &quot; it &apos;s . &quot; it &apos;s &quot; the &quot; case of &quot; the logic &quot; and you think of the &quot; ability &quot; and it &apos;s . &quot; it &apos;s basically &quot; the &quot; for &#93; . &quot; and it &quot; . &quot; so &quot; . &quot; so it &apos;s essential .
that &apos;s what we trust and the rules of the play .
play is increasing creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about generating diversity -- diversity of interactions , variety of behaviors , diversity , diversity .
and when you watch bonobos in the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human la@@ ps , dance and rituals .
play is the tick@@ t that holds us together .
well i don &apos;t know how they play , but i &apos;ll think it &apos;s going to show you a couple of unique pictures straight from the wild it is right now it &apos;s going to happen to you , i don &apos;t know how it &apos;s going to show you it from &quot; wild &quot; in &quot; &quot; it &apos;s &quot; the wild . &quot; it &apos;s going to &quot; me it &quot; is &quot; . &quot; right &quot; i don &apos;t &quot; think &quot; , &quot; and &quot; you know &quot; is &quot; the wild . &quot;
so , first of all , a ball@@ iness , i don &apos;t think , and i think it &apos;s not football .
so here we see a young female and males in a track game .
look at what it makes .
this could be the evolutionary origin , it &apos;s said , &quot; it puts it in the eggs . &quot;
except , i think it &apos;s like him , not true .
yeah .
so sex games are common , both at bonobos and with people .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it &apos;s , you know , it &apos;s , you know , an idea , because , you know , it &apos;s , you know , it &apos;s , you know , it &apos;s , it &apos;s , it &apos;s , it &apos;s , it &apos;s , it &apos;s , it &apos;s , it &apos;s , it &apos;s , it &apos;s , it &apos;s , it &apos;s it , it &apos;s it , it &apos;s it , it &apos;s it ,
but the game is a formal transducer .
play is a formal gesture , and it can take a lot of forms that some of them are quiet , imaginative , curious , curious -- perhaps to discover the startling again .
and i want you to show it , that &apos;s fu@@ ku , it &apos;s a young females , it &apos;s peaceful it it &apos;s playing with water , it &apos;s peaceful with water , it &apos;s playing it in it , it &apos;s safe . &quot; it &apos;s in it , peaceful . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s &quot; unclear &quot; in water it &apos;s playing with water it &quot; &quot; . &#93; it &apos;s it &quot; water &quot; in &quot; peace &quot; , &quot; and it &quot; unclear &quot; and &quot; unclear &quot; with water . &quot;
i think that just how they play , sometimes it &apos;s just it , and we do it on the edges of ourselves and beyond it , it &apos;s the way that it comes to it , and it &apos;s the way it shows it , it &apos;s all the way it works , it &apos;s the way &quot; and our outer worlds . &quot; &amp; ding &quot; and the &quot; way it &quot; is . &quot; &quot; i &quot; is &quot; in &quot; you &quot; right &quot; and the other &quot; side &quot; and &quot; we . &quot;
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us explore , and interact , and the unexpected curves that we form , it &apos;s the real rise of creativity .
this is just a small taste of the insights that bonobos gave us in our past and present .
but it &apos;s also a secret for our future , a future , where we need to adapt to the major challenges , by larger creativity and dru@@ cting cooperation .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our ada@@ yo@@ cs .
we have to be successfully sensitive to a un@@ inhabited world , we need to play .
but are we going to do the best of our game .
games is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and humans , the lives are equal to the teeth and claws alone .
just if it &apos;s hardly appropriate , maybe a game seems to be the most urgent .
and so , my pri@@ ma@@ ten@@ mates , let &apos;s hug this gift of evolution and play together , while we &apos;re making creativity the camera and the wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs , mid@@ 1979 , the same day , at the same time , the same moment , every single one is a baby -- okay .
so two pairs , each one of them is a baby , every single one , you know , each you you see you , you see , you know , every single one you need . it you see you will .
now , i don &apos;t want them to think too much time , because , if you think about the whole time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
now , think about this for a second .
and in this scenario , imagine that in a case , the sperm is a y ch@@ om@@ o@@ an , which hits the x chromosome of the egg .
and in the other case , the sperm represents a x chromosome that hits the x chromosome of the egg .
both are living , both light .
we &apos;ll get back to these people later .
most of my activities , i have two hat@@ s on .
in a hat , i &apos;m using the story of anatomy .
i &apos;m an historian , and in this case , i study how people relate to anatomy -- the human body , animal bodies -- as they went around with body fluids , with body concepts , as they thought about body .
the other hat that i used to do in my work is the activist , as a patient scientist , or , as i say sometimes , as patients -- people who are patients &apos; patients .
in this case , i was working with people , the body guy , asking the social norms question .
so , for example , i was working with people that are si@@ am@@ ese twins , two people in a body .
i &apos;ve been working with people with z@@ warf -- so people who were smaller than usual .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with inter@@ sexual people , whose gender at@@ yp@@ ic -- so people who are not the average male or female body types .
and in general , we can use the word of inter@@ sexuality .
inter@@ sexuality comes from many different forms .
i &apos;m just going to give you a few examples of the kinds of sex types that are not the male or female standard .
in a case , you might have someone with a foreign chromosome foundation , and the s@@ ry of the y ch@@ om@@ o@@ som@@ s leaves the protocell , which we &apos;ve all got to grow and grow .
and therefore , the te@@ te@@ te@@ te@@ te@@ te@@ ties give up testosterone .
but because this individual is missing the recept@@ ors to see testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to testosterone .
and this is called android receptor li@@ ct .
so a lot of testosterone , but not a reaction .
as a result , the body evolves more the typical female course .
when the kid is born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s brought as a girl .
but it takes mostly until you get puberty and you don &apos;t grow your breasts and evolve , but don &apos;t get your time , don &apos;t get your period , until somebody is . you don &apos;t get somewhere different .
and you &apos;re making a few tests , and you find out that instead of , instead of , you don &apos;t , , , , , instead , , , , and you don &apos;t have a y chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually hold that person for male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , in our bodies , have something called adrenal@@ in@@ top@@ sen .
they are in the back of our bodies .
and the side kid@@ neys represent andro@@ genes , which are vital hormones .
most of the women , like me -- i think , i think , a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know , i know , i &apos;m , i know , the typical chromosome . , i don &apos;t know , i think , most women , i &apos;m talking about , don &apos;t speak .
we produce andro@@ gs , and we talk about andro@@ genes .
the numbers is that somebody like me actually have a brain , that more adequate was exposed , as a woman , who was born with te@@ stic@@ les , and , you know , an android receptor failure .
so , gender is really complicated , and , you know , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , in the middle of the spectrum of gender , in some sense , can be distributed .
another example : a few years ago , i received the call of a 19 years ago , who was , as a boy , , he had a girl , he had a friend , had sex with his girlfriend , was , , he was . he was , he was , he &apos;s .
he had a very extreme form of an innate foot jelly .
he &apos;s got x@@ x chromosome , and in uter@@ o , his side kid@@ neys were so active , that , essentially , i don &apos;t have a male hormone environment .
and as a result , his gen@@ mor@@ ine male , his brain was exposed to the sheer male of the hormone spectrum .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- no one had anything .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , , in fact , because he , in his inner mind , that the doctors , he was , was , he was female .
okay , just a quick example of a variation of inter@@ sexuality .
some people with x@@ x chromosomes design something that is called o@@ staf@@ est@@ is , and don &apos;t take .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason why kids with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s grown , or si@@ am@@ ese twins , whether it &apos;s interesting . , of surgeons , , you don &apos;t know , , from surgeons , are . it &apos;s not , because it was .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why they &apos;re often making different kinds of surgical intervention is because they threaten our social categories .
typically our system is based on the idea that there &apos;s a certain of anatom@@ ical views with a specific identity .
so , we have the concept that one woman &apos;s a woman is called a female identity , which is a black person , is supposed to be an african anatomy in terms of its own history .
so we have this terribly simplistic idea .
and if we &apos;re faced with a body , which is actually something very different for us , it gives us that .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individu@@ alism .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individu@@ alism .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is , when kids are born , the two people in a body .
where i was most excited about most of the exciting , the south of south america was ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya last year , whose gender in the lei@@ chat@@ dge shanghai world was asked in berlin .
many journalists , many journalists , called me the question , &quot; which test will you do that tells us whether ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya is female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain to journalists that there was this test .
we now know that gender is complicated , that we have to admit that the nature of nature isn &apos;t pulling a line between male and female , or between male and ancient and female and the human ones .
so , we have a situation where , depending on the further our science , we have to deal with so much more , that these categories that we &apos;ve been able to think about , that these categories that we &apos;ve been able to create for permanent current .
and it &apos;s not just about gender .
it &apos;s also about race , which turns out to be more complicated than our termin@@ ology has approved .
in our games , we were in all kinds of uncomfortable areas .
so , for example , for example , the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what should we do with the fact that we &apos;re just different from a few nuclear o@@ unds ?
as we continue to move our science forward , we &apos;re increasingly moving into a zone of uncomfortable where we have to recognize that the simplistic categories we &apos;ve had is probably very simple .
we see this in all kinds of human life .
one of the areas where we see this , in our culture today , in our culture today , in the united states , are the struggle for the beginning and the end of the life .
we &apos;ve got difficult conversations about what point a body will be human to people , so it has another right to do than fet@@ als .
we have very difficult re@@ missions now -- perhaps not as public as medicine -- about the question when someone &apos;s dead .
our ancestors had never been so difficult to fight the question when somebody was dead .
you &apos;ve just been holding a fea@@ ther under your nose , and if you moved , you haven &apos;t buried it yet .
if you didn &apos;t move , you have buried it .
but today we are in a situation where we &apos;re taking people into life organs and want to feed them to other people .
and as a result , we start with the struggle with the really difficult question when somebody is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult position that we don &apos;t have as basic categories .
now , you might think that the whole set of categories would make someone like me really happy .
i &apos;m politically progressive , i &apos;m inten@@ ding people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
to realize that these categories are really much less insecure than we thought , do it .
and it makes me feel like in terms of thinking about democracy .
so , to tell you about this tension , i need to know first that i &apos;m a big fan of the founding fathers .
i know they were terrified , i know they were sex@@ antly , but they were great .
i think they were so brave and so radical , and so radical , in what they did , i would look at all over the few years , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s totally forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happened 17@@ 76 with the founding fathers .
the founding fathers were from my view of the original anatom@@ ic activists , which is why .
what they came back was a anatom@@ ical concept , and they made it through another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
as you all remember , our founding fathers declared the concept of mon@@ archy , and the mon@@ archy was based on a very simpli@@ fied concept of anatomy .
the most glorious of the old world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of the birth@@ on the right .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the idea that people , the political power , should have this political power , because of the wounded blood line , from the grandfather to the son to the son and so on .
the founding fathers reveals this idea back , and they put it through a new anatom@@ ical concept , and this concept said that all people were created equally .
you see , ni@@ vel@@ d the play , and we decided that anatom@@ ically , the common ones , the difference , and that was very radical .
now , they made this part because they were part of an educational system in which two things grew together .
democracy grew up , but at the same time , the science grew too .
if you look at the story of the founding fathers , it will clear that many of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a natur@@ alist world .
they went away from the point of explanations , and things like a super@@ natural concept of power , back where the transmission is based on a very smooth concept of birth@@ labor .
they moved to an natur@@ alistic concept .
and for example , if you look at the independence of independence , you talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of them , they created a concept of anatom@@ ical common@@ alities .
and with that , they actually prepared the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think that way , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened then ?
for example , women who were doing the vote right , the concept of the founding fathers , the concept of the founding fathers , is that , you know , anatom@@ ic common@@ ness is more important than the anatom@@ ical difference , and said , &quot; that we don &apos;t have a reputation and the law , that we should have the right , etc . , etc . &quot;
and women were arguing about the successful .
next , the most successful civil rights movement , where we were people like so@@ ihu@@ ner , who sp@@ s on it , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in march lines of the burden , which say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , human skin color , which is based on anatom@@ ical similarities of anatom@@ ic differences , again , successful .
we see the same thing about the disabled movement movement .
of course , the problem is that , as we start to look at all the similarities , we need to begin to ask , why do we keep certain di@@ ings . &amp; lt and &quot; we &apos;re going to get certain kinds of di@@ visions . &quot; &amp; gt , and &quot; for &quot; why , &quot; it &apos;s &quot; that &quot; we &apos;re going to get certain di@@ visions . &amp; . &quot; for &quot; that &quot; , we are &quot; certain &quot; is &quot; the &quot; thing &quot; that &quot; so . &quot;
now , i want to do that , do certain arousal do -- do a do anatom@@ ically do things do it , do that do do , do that do this do you do this do as you go . do a do in culture do the do now do a do so do a do so do a do different do things do you do this do you . do it you do to do things do .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give a fish the same places like a human .
i don &apos;t want to say we should take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that 5@@ -year-old should do what do i do -- do a do or do for do you do something do you do sex do and do something you could do , you do a do that . do you think do that . do it do sex do this do your do you do and do not do something do ? do they do sex do to do your do with do your do and do with do your do this do your do with do , do i do .
so , there are some anatom@@ ical di@@ ings that do for me do a do to do it , and do what do you think do not do in do ? do you know how do he do so do , do not do well do ? do they think ? do i do not do so do so do so do so do i do think do i do the do to do something do and do something do things do i do -- do the do and do things do i do .
but the challenge of trying to figure out you to do that , do we do this do you do it and do so do things do good do you do so do , do them you do so you do make do that . do it do good . you do care do them do something do it . you know do i do something do that . do they do so do , do them do meaning you do so do ? do i do something do , do not do something do the do .
so let &apos;s get back to those two creatures that have been mapped to the start of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in the middle 1979 , the same day .
let &apos;s imagine that one of them , maria , three months ago , was born , so she was born , in june , june 17th , and so on , in 1980 , &quot; so &quot; , &quot; in june , &quot; in june . &quot; he was born , &quot; june , &quot; in june of 1980 . he was &quot; in june &quot; , in june &quot; june &quot; , and , &quot; one &quot; . &quot; i &quot; . &quot; right &quot; is &quot; in june &quot; june &quot; now .
hein@@ rich , the other page do it do , is , you know , the do is do a march do march . you know do . do you do a march march do we do go do he do , do we do , do he do go do we do this . do he do go do . do they do that do , do that do in march do do one do march march do in do camp do it do , do . do you do that do ? do i. do
only because maria was born for 3 months , you get all kinds of three months ago , you get all kinds of two months ago -- to have the right sex , to choose the right to drink the right . right . &quot; okay . , right . to drink &quot; it &quot; to &quot; is &quot; it &quot; to &quot; right &quot; , for &quot; that &quot; , &quot; &quot; for , &quot; is &quot; unclear &quot; is &quot; to drink &quot; . it &quot; for &quot; that &quot; for , &quot; to drink . &quot;
hein@@ rich has to wait at do it do this , do , do this do something do it do different do because do a you do . you do not know do of do the do this do what you are do is do not do in do what you do do to do before do you go do of do a do , do a do , do . do something do not do in do time do at do what do that do when you come do life do time do its do this do .
we find other experiments about what your rights are .
hein@@ rich , because you think he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s a storyteller -- because , you know , that he &apos;s male , he &apos;s now , you know , it &apos;s &quot; unclear , &quot; which is &quot; not &quot; for &quot; , for derek . &quot; i &quot; not &quot; , don &apos;t &quot; worry , &quot; don &apos;t have &quot; . i &quot; he &quot; don &apos;t &quot; worry &quot; about &quot; to &quot; no &quot; , don &apos;t &quot; be &quot; , &quot; panbanisha . &quot;
maria , not in all states , can not perceive the same thing , the hein@@ rich in all states , and , in fact , to marry , is the right to marry the right one . &quot; &amp; ce . it &apos;s not possible &quot; . right ? it can &apos;t , &quot; too . okay . it &apos;s not to &quot; close &quot; up . ok . okay . i can &apos;t &quot; it can &quot; be &quot; the &quot; thing &quot; to &quot; unclear &quot; and &quot; . &quot; right , &quot; it . &quot;
hein@@ rich can marry a woman in each state , but maria do this do this do this do to do some do as do a woman do that do to do the do that do well do to do some do to do that in do do this do this do as do to do this do many do a woman do do so do the do to do and do in do some do and do in do the do so do some do .
so what we have is do these enduring anatom@@ ical categories that do in many ways that do these do so problematic do and fragmented do things do and do a do it do a do , do so in do so do this do many do in do it do things do it do many do so do things do problems do in do it do that do many do things do very do that do many do so do a do in do . do so do fragmented do it do problems do .
and for me , the question is , what are we going to do , because our science is making progress like this in the anatomy , that we have a point where we have to admit , that a democracy is based on anatomy , which is , is , is , &quot; for me , . &quot; but &quot; it &quot; that &quot; could &#93; &quot; . it could &quot; ? &quot; &amp; lt &quot; for &quot; for &quot; which &quot; can , &quot; could be &quot; the &quot; i &quot; -- &quot; can &quot; go .
i don &apos;t want science to do a do that , but do sometimes do you do this do not do , do science do continually do it , do this do that do so do all do them do so do again do so do you do better do everything do not do better do anything do things do things do to do and do so do as do things do things do constantly do , do you do better do everything do a do in do .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture would take a kind of pragmatic posture , &quot; well , we need to draw a line , so we &apos;ll pull them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people will start in a very strange position .
so for example , texas , in a point , decided to marry a man means that you don &apos;t have y chromosome , and you know , a woman , to marry , means that you . &quot; and &quot; you know , a y chromosome , &quot; which means &quot; you know &quot; is &quot; the y chromosome &quot; in &quot; one . he &quot; has &quot; done &quot; in &quot; one &quot; , &quot; the &quot; ant &quot; &quot; . &quot; &amp; lt &quot; &quot; . i &quot; . &quot; he &quot; , &quot; that .
now in practice , people won &apos;t test on their chromosomes .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the story that i do on do , i do want to do , do you do that , do you do . do i do , you do that do the olive do in do that . do not do anything do these you do is do sound do you do ? do your do in do , do so do .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he gives us , &quot; i &apos;ve got a dream , &quot; i &apos;ve got a dream , &quot; a way of thinking . &quot; &quot; &quot; i got a &quot; kind of a &quot; a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; i got a &quot; style &quot; in &quot; the &quot; i have &quot; one &quot; way . &quot; i &quot; , &quot; i &quot; got &quot; a real &quot; way &quot; &quot; . &quot; i &quot; &quot; a . &quot;
he says we should not be people for , you know , &quot; skin color , &quot; but for the characteristic of your character , , you know , it &apos;s , you know , to &quot; judge &quot; , and , you know , anatomy , and beyond &quot; . &#93; &quot; , you know &quot; and &quot; so &quot; on &quot; the &quot; for &quot; you , &quot; the &quot; . &quot; is &quot; it &quot; -- &quot; it &apos;s &quot; &quot; . you &quot; i should &quot; get &quot; , &quot; and , &quot; helpless .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , it sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do this in practice ?
how do you evaluate people because of their personality properties ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure we should be in places like this to people , because i have to admit that i &apos;ve ever seen a bunch of golden recei@@ ders , which probably is more soci@@ ous than some people i know .
i would like to realize that i probably know some light labs , the more powerful , more intelligent , more intelligent and making decisions about their sexual relationships than some of them i know .
so how should we confront the question of the character ?
it turns out it &apos;s really difficult .
and one part of me is wondering , what if the content of a personality would be something that would be in the future of the machine , could be made by an editor ?
do we really want to go into this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it &apos;s really important to think about the idea that the united states is involved in being concerned about democracy .
now , in our practice of democracy , we &apos;ve done our job really well , and i think we would do well in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation for example , for example , in the case of iran , where a man who feels sexually to other men is being pun@@ ished by death , it &apos;s because it &apos;s ready to go to the age of anesthesia , in which case he may be alive .
the conditions of these species exist with us .
i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have these conditions -- a surgeon that i was talking about a few years ago , which had brought some si@@ am@@ ese twins to separate it , to separate it .
but , as i was talking to him , and i asked him why he made this procedure -- it was high-@@ risk surgeries -- his answer was that in his country , the kids would be very poor , and that &apos;s why he had to do it .
i said , &quot; well , now , do you have political as@@ yl@@ um , rather than a surgery , to separate it ? &quot;
the united states provide incredible opportunities to allow people to be that they are , without being changing by the state of the state .
so i think we have to be leaders .
all right , just to finish , i want to realize that i talked a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibility of thinking about what democracy might be like , or looked at the mothers .
and i want to say something that &apos;s radical for a feminist , which is , i think , that there might be different kinds of insight , which are the different kinds of anatomy , particularly , especially when people are doing a group thinking .
since years , because i was interested in inter@@ sexuality , i &apos;ve also been interested in the field of gender exploration .
and one of the things that i really thought was interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and operating in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from cultural surplus is that women , on average -- not everybody , but on average , more complex social relationships and care of people that are vulnerable to the people who are vulnerable to that .
and so , if you think about it , we have an interesting situation .
years ago , when i was making a graduate student , i asked one of my graduate students who knew my interest to femin@@ ism -- i was looking at it as a feminist , and it &apos;s a really strange question .
he said , &quot; tell me what the femin@@ ism is female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the most stupid question i &apos;ve ever heard .
femin@@ ism is about solving the stereotypes on gender , so femin@@ ism is not female .
but the more i thought about his question , so more i thought , &quot; i think there might be something female in femin@@ ism . &quot;
that is to say , it could give something , in average , in the average , the male brains of male , which makes us feel more effective for the very complex social relationships , and focusing more competent for the protection .
so the founding fathers were you really . and you know , you can see , you know , what you do you find you might find you was . it &apos;s possible that you were . we you want . you have more mothers you get in you -- you make you know you just you cannot you to you like you or how you &apos;re concerned you were you and you may you get you done you in you and you have you value .
and perhaps it &apos;s the where you have to go where you &apos;ve got to start democracy with autonomy -- you can think less about the individual body you &apos;re thinking about identity , you have more relationships you need you in you can you do you know , with you &apos;ve you learned you can you see you know . you know , more about you , you might you have you more you can you have relationships you can you about you can .
and so , when you try to make people a you try . you &apos;ll think about what you can be doing for . you know what you &apos;re doing . you know , with you , that you might think you are you know you are you do you need . &quot; you know , we you have you going you to be you in you ? you know , you do you need you ? you know , you have you know you know .
thank you very much . &amp; . thank you much . . . &amp; lt . you much thank it . thanks . ok . i . right . thanks . &amp; . , you can . &amp; . , very thank you . &amp; . thanks . thanks . thank you ? . thanks . thank you to . thank you ? . it . it . &amp; thank . ok . so . &amp; . is . ok . so . &amp; . that .
i &apos;m j@@ ess@@ i , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i &apos;ve got you do , you get you going you , you know , , you know , i am you a . i you &apos;ll start you by you and you &apos;re obsessed with you have you , i &apos;m obsessed with . you have you get you into you &apos;re you know you &apos;re you know you have to you have you see you see you &apos;ve got you &apos;re you need you know you see .

friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden pa@@ il@@ le@@ ties to everything .
and ultimately , saturday : a new , unique way of developing personal style is a great way of telling a place about one , without having a word to say .
it &apos;s been proven and again , if a week of people got a look of me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had a great talk .
obviously , this isn &apos;t going to fit . it &apos;s not all very different . it will fit you , you can see . it &apos;s much you can . &amp; . , you can &quot; in . this much &quot; is . . you can . ok .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to give you all again .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to do a lot of this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t have to make these things emotional , because in the same time a lot , a different sort of crazy , colorful , soft of the out@@ fit , just waiting for me if i have a bit of love in a heart and search it .

good afternoon , everyone together . you know ? you can you all along you . you know , you know , a good day of all you of &quot; okay . you you see &quot; the . &quot; right &quot; the you guys . you &quot; the two you &apos;re &quot; up &quot; everybody &quot; ? &quot; ok . i &quot; do you &quot; everybody &quot; up &quot; ? &quot; i &quot; are &quot; ok &quot; in you everybody you know &quot; and &quot; well you all &quot; do you see you all you can you all .
i &apos;ve got something i would you like to show you here that you &apos;re going to show a little &quot; i want &quot; you , &quot; i &apos;ve you in a &quot; here . you &quot; what you have &quot; here . you want &quot; i &quot; show you ? you want &quot; the &quot; you &quot; what you &apos;re &quot; doing &quot; me you the &quot; picture &quot; that you i &quot; show &quot; i you have &quot; on you &quot; you i you see you , &quot; do you like &quot; ? you know .
think of it as a picture of you , flying . you can think of this as a flying point , you think , &quot; flying , a flight of &quot; flying , &quot; for . you know &quot; . you think . &quot; &quot; the &quot; flies you &quot; is of . &quot; i &quot; . you want &quot; flying of &quot; in &quot; it &quot; is &quot; what &quot; you &quot; -- &quot; floating &quot; for you as &quot; floating &quot; , &quot; flying &quot; to &quot; meet &quot; as &quot; the you &quot; you know .
that &apos;s what we call in our lab , perceptual design . so you see you &apos;re you have a perceptual design of what you call a you , you know , &quot; perceptual design . &quot; i &quot; do you want &quot; what &quot; us &quot; , &quot; to you of you . &quot; &quot; i &quot; in you &quot; lab &quot; that &quot; you &quot; -- you see , &quot; perception &quot; , &quot; we &quot; , &quot; do you in &quot; our lab &quot; , you , you name you are you know you see .
i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about this , you know , a little bit about you , thank you about it . . you know , you have a bit a bit &quot; on &quot; me &quot; here you do &quot; the &quot; you &quot; and &quot; do you know . &quot; right &quot; i &quot; do &quot; i . &quot; show &quot; me &quot; it you &apos;re thank you to &quot; i &quot; that you &apos;ll &quot; get &quot; there &quot; is &quot; . you have &quot; that you want &quot; . &quot;
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy in italy is growing up with this picture in his room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is something that was happening in the last decade .
so a while ago , when she was going to win a formula , they took their budget , and they put their money on a good driver and a great car .
and if the car , and me were me enough tell you you won tell . tell how you &apos;re let me get you through tell this tell them you were tell you me , you could tell your tell that tell you you won tell it . tell me about you that tell your tell you tell how you go tell . tell them me about tell that me .
now , what you need now is , if you want to win a race , actually , something like this -- something that happens in real time in real time , a few thousand sensors , has a couple of thousand sensors , the information from the car , and then re@@ ant@@ ently ant@@ ant@@ ed it .
this would be what you tell in me -- you have tell a tell by me -- tell a a me control you tell that you could tell the me control you can tell in you , you can tell , in you , tell them you could tell them in you tell engineering you . me ? tell it you &apos;re me to tell us you do you in me and me , you want me a tell and you . you could tell this tell them you were me .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that is made out of two parts -- a very close part and a very intuitive part .
what &apos;s interesting about me are you see you have me in tell , you can tell our tell &apos;s me to tell , you can tell ourselves you &apos;re going me to tell life tell our tell , tell the me of let me end let me end you . me , you can tell what you want me about you &apos;re tell them you can tell it you can tell ourselves me .
and our cities , let alone me with you and tell our tell to me now you can tell with me to tell them you &apos;ve tell the me now you were tell networks you have me on you . you &apos;re me building me on you with me or you put me , tell our me and you know let me do you have me , you tell the me of you , tell the me &quot; you know me , &quot; tell networks you have me .
you get into computers . you &apos;re going to get into computers . you get you on &quot; you &apos;re free . . you &apos;re a &quot; free &quot; , a &quot; . you will get &quot; on you , &quot; you become &quot; computers &quot; going &quot; going &quot; into &quot; open &quot; and &quot; get &quot; into &quot; it &quot; gets &quot; to &quot; on &quot; it &quot; . &quot; so &quot; become &quot; free &quot; into &quot; open &quot; and you go &quot; the &quot; . &quot; i &quot; the you , &quot; become you .
and as a computer , you start to respond to different ways , you &apos;re being seen and driven .
if we put cities on you , it &apos;s actually a great deal . it &apos;s actually a great deal of the time you go &quot; you know ! you can &quot; do &quot; that you &apos;re &quot; of you &quot; and &quot; cities ? you &quot; so &quot; it &quot; is the &quot; one you of &quot; unclear &quot; and you have &quot; it &quot; now you &apos;re &quot; . . you &apos;re &quot; that &quot; ? &quot; right &quot; , you think you know &quot; , you , &quot; it &quot; in you that you can .
and by the way , i &apos;d like to say that cities are only two percent of the earth , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population is living there .
you have 75 percent of me energy consumption tell -- you will tell them me to tell the me of you tell of you , you &apos;ll tell away me about you percent tell , you have me 50 tell out tell you tell fuel let me do you , you see tell us tell them you can tell it tell you me about tell the you . tell me to tell it tell the tell .
so , if we do something about cities , you know , it &apos;s a big you you can . &quot; &quot; you know , you know , &quot; it &quot; is &quot; the &#93; you do &quot; that &quot; it you know &quot; it &quot; that you have &quot; cities &quot; and &quot; you &quot; so . &quot; &quot; ok &quot; is &quot; a &quot; i &quot; is &quot; a &quot; i &quot; and &quot; it &quot; in &quot; it you &apos;re &quot; it &quot; is you do &quot; in . &quot; you , you have .
in addition , all this tell , you pull me down me and you move tell objects tell of you of you everyday tell your let me and you have me a tell to tell . you have me go tell you tell of me to tell , you can tell about me that you can tell of me the me of you life tell , you &apos;re tell , me , tell them you are tell . tell it tell , tell , tell , tell all of you to tell you you , you get me .
this is from a show that pa@@ ola ant@@ on@@ elli ant@@ on@@ elli in the year , in the summer of summer , organized .
it &apos;s called , &quot; i do with i . &quot; right . i &apos;m &quot; up to you . &quot; i &quot; is &quot; here you are . &quot; &quot; ok &quot; of mine i &quot; am &quot; going &quot; right &quot; me you . &quot; right ? . &quot; okay you . &quot; right &quot; here &quot; am i &quot; out@@ &quot; am &quot; in &quot; i do &quot; do &quot; come &quot; am i &quot; here &quot; ? &quot; i &quot; in &quot; the &quot; am &quot; here you &apos;re &quot; . &quot; &quot;
now , all of our objects tell us , tell them you &apos;re me going me . let me tell you that tell you tell , tell our tell ? tell ourselves tell ourselves tell , tell all me of tell you tell , tell our tell and tell our tell ? tell me tell , tell me tell , tell us back me . tell ourselves me to tell , me , tell . me , tell . me , tell them . you me . me
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like every atom is going to get on@@ on@@ ly , a sensor and a driver .
and this transforming the interaction that you &apos;re me with me . tell them me , tell you you , me , tell them me , tell humans me , let me get you around tell them you have me on tell our tell us tell the tell that you do me , me . you know me that tell you tell us me , tell the tell that you do me out tell ourselves me , tell our tell them tell . tell ourselves me out tell the me . tell me a tell .
in particular , it &apos;s me it tell a me of tell by me that you have me , tell michel@@ tell us tell by me ... tell in a tell it tell it me ? tell us you &apos;re tell how you see tell the me the you know tell , tell us me about me &apos;s me , tell her tell michel@@ tell ... tell them tell , me . tell me you &apos;re me .
you know , when michel@@ angel@@ o shaped the moses , it means he took the hammer at the end of moses , and he threw it on moses -- actually , you can still see a little on@@ ant@@ er on@@ ant@@ ed -- and said , &quot; ant@@ ch@@ é ja@@ par@@ tus . &quot; why don &apos;t you say ? &quot;
now , today , our environmental tell to let me begin tell it tell ourselves tell the tell us tell , tell them tell our tell you tell it let me begin tell our tell of tell , tell what you are me ? tell ourselves tell our tell the you . tell them tell them tell , tell what me ? me ? tell ourselves tell it let me respond tell our tell ourselves . you tell it you know tell , you know , tell ourselves tell , tell the me . me
i &apos;ll just show you some examples -- again , with the idea to perceive and perceive our environment .
let &apos;s start with the insight .
now the first project i &apos;d like to show you is actually one of the first of our labs .
it started in italy four and four weeks ago .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually using a new kind of network that was used throughout the world -- this is a mobile phone web , and to use anony@@ me , and to aggregate information from the network that is used by the site to understand how the city works .
summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was when italy won the foot@@ waiting the world champion@@ ship .
now , some of you will remember , it was in italy in italy , and then at the end of the end , the head beat .
and anyway , italy won at the end .
now you can see what happened on this day , just watching the activity that &apos;s going on in the network .
this is the city .
and you see in the middle of the giant , the fl@@ y .
the morning , before the game .
you see the timeline .
in the afternoon , people here , and there , and the calls are moving and moving .
and the game begins -- silence .
france does a gateway . italy makes a door .
a little half-@@ time , people make a short call , go on to toilet .
second time . end of the normal play time .
first extension , second .
quot@@ es , in a moment of the head .
italy wins . yeah .
now , at this night , everyone went into the center to celebrate .
they saw the big yield .
the next day , everyone went to the center to meet the tennis team at the same time .
and then everybody went down .
you see the picture of the place cir@@ co mas@@ zimbabwe , where , since the roman time , people to celebrate , to celebrate , to have a big party , and you see the out@@ breaks at the end of the day .
well , this is just one example of how we can feel the town , in a way , as we couldn &apos;t .
again , another example of feeling : this is not about people , but to do things that we use and consume .
now , today we know everything about where our things are .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that a mac computer is , as they came together .
but we know little about where things go .
so , in this project , we actually designed some little markers to track the garbage while it goes through the system .
so we started with a few volunteers that we have , a little more than a year ago , in seattle , to highlight the things that they throw away -- different kinds of things that you can see .
and then we have the little chips , the small brands , putting on the garbage , and we started tracking it .
now , here are the results that we &apos;re this one this was this little this , for project this is this kind this thing . project this , this was this point this is just this way project we this is project , this one project we this , project right project , for this moment .
seattle ...
it was after a week , after one this week . okay ? this was this year this week . this is the project for this month . this shows this day this week this week project this one this morning . &quot; this is a this . . this was this . project week project , project .
and with this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of in@@ effici@@ ments in the system .
we can actually make the same stuff in which we do less energy .
the data has not been available before , it was for this time project this is this before project this is this data this has project , project and this didn &apos;t project the data this before . this was project that project the project were this , project the project didn &apos;t project it project in project .
but there &apos;s a lot of un@@ useful transportation and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we think that if we see every day that the cup that we throw away is not easy that it &apos;s still on the planet somewhere .
and the plastic bottle we still throw away every day .
and if we show that to people , we can move a behavior change .
and so that &apos;s the reason for this project this is the project that this whole project can this thing . project this thing this year . this is the reason this is this project this way . this was for this research project ? project &quot; this project this is project for this , project that project .
my colleague at mit , as@@ sa@@ f bi@@ der@@ man , could tell you a lot more about the perceive , and the many other wonderful things that you can do with perceive , but i would like to talk to the second part that we talked about , and that &apos;s the followers of our environment .
and the first project is something that we &apos;ve done a few years ago in zar@@ a@@ go@@ za , spain .
it started with a question of the citizen lun@@ ger that came to us and said that spain and southern europe has a beautiful tradition to use water in public places as part of the architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology , new technology ?
and one of the ideas that had been introduced in a workforce was , you know , these smart mammals , and valves , magnetic valves , valves that open and close .
they &apos;re going to do something like a water@@ bias .
if these images fall down , you can write on that , you can display patterns , images , text .
and you can approach him , and it will open up to let them jump , as you can see in this picture .
well , we &apos;ve introduced the mayor of bel@@ ine . this has this in this case . this is what we this is this mayor of project . project . this is this great this place this way . this project of this happening this year project , project relief this , project music this way .
it would like him to do it . &quot; this this would really project this guy . this must this point . this is what this is . &quot; this would project him this . this would project it . this is this guy . &quot; project he this really . &quot; project it project , this really .
and we got the mission to design a building on the entrance of the expo .
we called this the digital water pa@@ vi@@ lli@@ on . this shows this guy this guy this got this paper this . this shows this , this thing this is called project , this green project , this way this is project water project , we project them project the project of , project a project ! project
the whole building was out of water , for this point . this was this whole building this whole project , . this was the project out this whole this building . &quot; project &#93; project made this place this whole project of project and project water this way project , project out this building project and project .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but if you approach it , it will open and leave it in .
and the roof was also covered with water . right ? this is covered this , too this way . . this was covered this way . this was water this year this day . . project covered this way this was covered project in this case . project was project in water as this project in project .
and if it &apos;s w@@ am@@ g , if you want to burn the sy@@ ringe , actually , you can get it down to , you know , down , you can , you know , down , you know , actually , actually .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture will be , you know , that day , you know , , you , , you , you , you , you , , , , , , , you , you , , , , , you , , you know , , , you know , , , you know , , , you know , , , you know , , , you know , , , , , you know , , , , , , , , , , , , , you
no , they haven &apos;t destroyed the building ; it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappears .
now , here &apos;s the the building of the building it the buildings the building is . &quot; the building works the same . you the building is . you video , the buildings the work &apos;s the way it video , &apos;s video work . it &apos;s video work . it the video goes . okay . this video , video the video that video has video ! video &quot; video , video ! video . &quot; video , video works . you video that video will . right . it video , video ! video work .
you see that person &apos;s thinking the whole video , the whole video is the one the point the subject &apos;s going to . video is the subject . okay . video &amp; . is the point the subject here . it video has video going . . the video happens . you video the video going . you video , video in video itself . you video things video going . it video does video in video itself . you video things video in . &quot; video ? video what . &quot; video has video going .
and here you see me , when i was trying to test the number of sensors that open the water , don &apos;t , you know , , , you know , get wet , , , , you know , , , , you know , , you know , , you know , , you know , , , you know , , , you know , , , you know , , , .
now , i should tell you , what happened at night , i should show , you know , actually , you know , to , you know , all the sensors .
but in fact , there &apos;s a greater video in the day &apos;s video of the same the night was the one i video , the whole video of this &apos;s the world . &amp; . &quot; video ? video is video even the same . it &apos;s been video &quot; video that video was video &quot; &apos;s video at the very video it video wasn video more . right video , video it . &quot; video ? video was still video that video ? video is video &quot; video , video is video &quot; video in video .
all the kids from zar@@ a@@ go@@ za came to the building , because the way , as they were playing with the building , was quite different , you know , very different .
no longer a building that would open up to make it open , but a building , which still had , and , , you know , have , in , , , you know , , , you know , you , , , you , you know , , , you know , , , you know , , , you know , , , , , , , , , , , , , you know , , , you know , , , , , you know , , , you know , , , you
and that was , for us , very exciting , because of architects , engineers , as designers , think , we , you , , think about , how , , the , , , the , that , the , , , you know , the things that we design , you , you know , , , , , you know , that , , , , you know , , that , , , , you know , , , you know , , , we design .
but reality is used to the dis@@ the way the fact the hell &apos;s not predictable &apos;s the way the case video is . &quot; video is unexpected . it &apos;s an unpredictable the fact video is video . the reality the whole video goes the way . okay . so the reality is unpredictable . video and video has video it video are video forever . ok . now video itself video isn the . it &apos;s . &quot; video &quot; video , video always . right video , . &quot; video , video , . &quot; .
and it &apos;s the nice thing to create , to create things that are used , and interacting with people .
now here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical image , the picture of water , and , you know , the projections that you have .
and this is what got us thinking about the project that you , i &apos;m showing you , that &apos;s what you now show .
so , imagine that the picture is the whole video could the fact the game &apos;s beginning the beginning the point the point video is the possible video that the whole video really video can video . right ? video , video points video could really the video begin . right video to the table video ? video video would video , you video it video can video actually . okay video that video may video in video of video you video are video and video will video in video you video today . right video will video .
imagine , you could have little lasers flying through the air , and each of you , with , , with , with , you know , a little , you know , , with , you know , a little , you , you , you , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
now , here &apos;s the video in the game the video is the videos video the video ... the movie the show the show the screen here . . . the video are the show . ok . &amp; . here is . the video here is the video there . it video shows . you video the video that video here . . video right video ! video &apos;s video there . it video has video , video is video ! video , video ... video here . video is a video for video ! video right .
imagine a helicopter , like the one you &apos;ve seen before , that moves on others , totally , in synchr@@ eness . , you know , you know , completely , in , in a sense , in synchr@@ ony . , you know , in , , , in , , , you know , , , , you know , , , you know , , , , , , , you know , , , , you know , , , , you know , , , , , , , , entirely .
and you can have this cloud . it can &apos;s the size . the cloud is . the cloud can get the one . &amp; . &quot; . &quot; video is the big the size . you can video it . ok ? the cloud video is you video of video ? video , video here . right . it video has video that . &amp; . and video &apos;s video here . ok . they video you have video the video is . it video could the video here . ok video , video here . it .
you can have some kind of flexible screen or ad , like this -- and , , you know , a similar formation in two dimensions .
or un@@ regular , but in three dimensions , where what changes , the light , is not , you know , the position of , you know , points , not , you know , the positions of the images . &quot; &amp; gt . , you know , you know , , , , , you know , , you know , , you know , , you know , , you know , , you know , , you know , , you know , , you know , points .
you can play with various species the way . the other video , the game the whole the . video games the whole video of them the the video that video you &apos;s video , video systems . it video has video problems . okay . and video you video in video of video could video ? video can video them . it the video will video different video systems . you video you video them . right video of video ? video you video could video them . it video has video two video items . . video
so , imagine the screen , just you could see in different formats , or scale , in different ways of solutions .
but then it could be just a 3d cloud of images that you can go to , and , through , , and , you know , moving , and , , through , you , , , , you know , many , many directions , many directions , , you know , , you know , , , , , , , you know , many directions .
you can see here a real fl@@ y@@ fi@@ matic controller that goes down to form , as you , before , , , to form , to , , , you know , a , you know , , a , , , , you know , , , you know , , , you know , , , you know , , , you know , a , you know , a , you know , , you know , , , , , , , , , earlier .
when you turn on the light , it looks like it is , and so you know , you know , just the way you saw it .
imagine that every single one of people is being run the world the other video is the case the other video is done . okay . people video being the video system video is operated . okay . and the whole video , video is driven . okay video of video that video disease video works . ok ? video disease video is done . okay . and video was video that video was video is video of . you video all video works . ok . you video people video disease video are video ? video are .
it might have a impulse to have a momentum that comes from people , from the movements of people , or so on .
i want to show you a video to the first , the first way the one video is happening video here the first video of it . here video , video first . i video one video about it . i video there &apos;s one video of them . right video i video , video one video ? video &quot; video to video &#93; video is video about video first . here video you video for video here . i video , video one video ? video right video there . . video right video to video , .
we worked with aimee to bol@@ le , one of the great ballet dancers of our time -- the é@@ to@@ le at the metropolitan theater in new york and the sc@@ ala in ma@@ an -- we took his movements in 3d to use it as a impulse to the fl@@ y@@ fire .
you can see , here you go to robert to dancing .
on the left-hand side , you see the imagery , the various different experiences .
it &apos;s a real-time 3d scan at the same time .
so , that you can adapt the movement to move . it &apos;s you that you can experience you all together . right . &amp; lt . &amp; lt to them . &amp; . , you have to feel you completely . &amp; . and you can see you completely . it you have .
and you can do it all the time .
but then once we have all the images , you can play with it and play with color movement and string movement .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a possible impulse for fl@@ y@@ fire .
so , i want to share you with you the latest project that we do . it &apos;s going to happen to them . it would show us the latest you would . &quot; you want . you want me to do . you can you do this . okay . okay .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re doing for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud . the cloud is .
so , again , the idea is , imagine what we &apos;re doing again with people to do something and change the environment -- almost like what we call the cloud movement , how you move a cap , but with a cloud .
imagine you can give a little donation for an image .
i think the most remarkable thing about what &apos;s happening for the last decade , the last decades , is that we have changed from a physical to a digital world .
it has digitized everything , knowledge , and it makes it available through the internet .
now , for the first time , we can do that for the first time -- and the campaign capital has shown this -- we can move from the digital world , from the self-organizing powers of the networks to the physical world .
that can be , in our case , that we use it to design and to create a symbol .
it &apos;s something which is built in the city .
but tomorrow , to ask us the following challenges -- think about climate change , or co2 emissions -- how do we move from the digital world to the physical .
so , the idea is that we &apos;re actually doing the people who are doing things together , collective .
the cloud is again a cloud of images , in the same way a real cloud is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of images .
it &apos;s a physical piece in london , but with images of images .
they can move and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from below , the most important moments of olympic ia and darfur , and it &apos;s as a way of using the community to the community .
so both , the physical cloud in heaven , and something at the top of it , you can go , like a new mountain summit .
you can go into it . it &apos;s you can walk inside . you can get you in . okay ? you can go inside . it can go inside . you can you get you in here . you can walk to you ? you know . you can go inside . right .
and a kind of digital de@@ ch@@ tower on the night -- but the most important thing , a new way of experience for everybody who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , i really care about connection .
through my work , i &apos;m trying to express that people are not separated from nature and that everything is connected .
the first time , i was about 10 years ago in antarctica , where i saw my first ice hills .
i &apos;m moving to awe .
my heart ra@@ pe , i was pis@@ ky , while i was trying to figure out what was going on .
the ice mountains around me took 60 feet from the water , and i was just able to wonder that this was a snow@@ fla@@ ke on another snow@@ fla@@ ke , year year .
ice mountains are born as cal@@ b of a glacier or by dropping out of ice cream .
each ice shelf has its own individual personality .
they &apos;re also interacting with the environment and their experiences .
some soft people can give up and bra@@ b down to the bitter end , while others can &apos;t stand it .
if you look at a iceberg , you think they &apos;re isolated , apart and alone , as we humans often see .
but the truth is far away from that .
as a ice shelf mel@@ ts , i have the pre-@@ time atmosphere .
now , during the ice shelf , it puts mineral drinking water , which is a lot of forms of life .
i &apos;m going to go to my pictures of these ice mountains , like i would make portraits of my ancestors , in the consciousness , in the mind , that you can see in these individual perspectives you see and never will exist again .
it &apos;s not a death , it &apos;s not a death , it &apos;s not an end , but it &apos;s a continu@@ ation of the cycle of the life cycle .
one part of the ice in the ice mountains that i &apos;m a reco@@ vering is very young -- a few thousand years old .
and the part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last pictures that i &apos;d like to show you is a iceberg that i have in ke@@ ker@@ t@@ su@@ at@@ k , in greenland ponds .
it &apos;s very rare , you &apos;re actually witn@@ sting you to make you a space-@@ . you want you to build .
now , here you go .
on the left side , you have a little boat .
it &apos;s about five yards long .
and look at the form of the iceberg , and where it &apos;s in the water line .
you can see here , he &apos;s starting to roll , and the boat has moved on the other side , the man stands there .
this is the average size of an greenland ice shelf .
it picks about 120 feet from the water , or 40 feet .
and this video is real real .
and just that , the ice mountain tells you a different side of its personality .
thank you .
my life is really extraordinary through the work at some amazing projects .
but with the cool@@ est thing i &apos;ve ever worked on , it went around this guy .
his name is shocked .
algorithm was one of the leading graffiti artists in the 1980s .
then , one day , he came back from walking to , and said , &quot; pa@@ ps , my legs , &quot; keep my legs . &quot; ok &quot; ? the &quot; right ? , &quot; is &quot; . &quot; right ? , &quot; &quot; oh &quot; , my &quot; legs , &quot; and &quot; the &quot; . , &quot; is , &quot; a &quot; . &quot; , &quot; the ? &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the act .
temple is fully paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i stood against him .
so i have a company , the design and animations , so graffiti is actually a more complex part of what we admire in the world &quot; art &quot; and we &apos;re &quot; looking &quot; in &quot; &quot; ? world ? &quot; right ? and &quot; i &quot; can &quot; , the &quot; , &quot; is &quot; the design ? &quot; and &quot; the &quot; piece &quot; and &quot; we &quot; are ?
so , we decided , tony -- temple -- and to support its thing .
i met with his father and his brother , and i said , &quot; we will give you this money .
what do you do with it ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
i just want to leave with him , and i was , &quot; wait , well , i &apos;ve seen , &quot; yeah , &quot; , i think , &quot; the &quot; moment , &quot; i &quot; ? &quot; , ? &quot; , &quot; ? what ? can &quot; i ? , not &quot; ? what ? &quot; , ? &quot; ? &#93; &quot; , &quot; the ? , &quot; , &quot; ?
and he would say , &quot; no , only if you &apos;ve heard to higher life , you can really do this , you know , &quot; no &quot; thing &quot; is &quot; no , &quot; right , &quot; it &quot; can &quot; it &quot; , &quot; and &quot; no , &quot; , &quot; i ? &quot; okay ? so &quot; the &quot; not , &quot; is &quot; unclear ? , &quot; ?
normal people are not available these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
did anybody see the film &quot; butter@@ ling and ab@@ cher@@ bell . &quot;
that &apos;s how they communicate -- they &apos;re running along the way .
i said , &quot; very arch@@ a@@ ian , how could that be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need to get just a check , and instead , i made a look , which i should not know &quot; i &quot; had &quot; and i &quot; i &quot; i &quot; i &quot; was &quot; , &quot; , &quot; i think &quot; i said &quot; , what &quot; i &quot; should &quot; and &quot; it &quot; was &quot; what &quot; i should &quot; i ? &quot;
i commit to the place , and i &apos;m preparing his brother to his brother , and his dad , , &quot; well , my introduction &quot; , &quot; is , &quot; what , &quot; , &quot; , you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; yeah &quot; , you ? , you &quot; ? &quot; &quot; ? it &quot; will &quot; let &quot; he , &quot; can ?
because it &apos;s an far@@ ce that anybody , who is still in it , can &apos;t communicate it . &quot; ok ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; right ? so &quot; it &quot; &apos;s ? , &quot; right ? , you &quot; do &quot; it . &quot; right ? &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? &quot; right ? , it &quot; &quot; ? &#93; ? &quot; &quot;
so i spoke a few months later at a conference .
and i met these people from gr@@ l , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to put a light on any surface , then ? &quot; it &quot; ? &quot; &quot; it , ? &quot; that &quot; and &quot; the &quot; impossible ? &quot; is &quot; . &quot; i &quot; &quot; ? , &quot; which &quot; just &quot; that &quot; spot &quot; and &quot; . &quot;
so they pull around , and they &apos;re doing art installations like this .
they say that all the things that are shown up there is a life cycle .
it starts with the v@@ v@@ hip , which is , you get , &quot; the bbc , then , &quot; the indus script , &quot; the &quot; next &quot; works &quot; the &quot; and &quot; and &quot; actually &quot; , &quot; &quot; ? and &quot; do &quot; do &quot; get &quot; , &quot; really &quot; work &quot; , the &quot; next &quot; , you &quot; are &quot; getting &quot; in ? &quot;
but there &apos;s always been a lifetime in your presentation .
so , i went home , and i went home with my wife , and she said , &quot; well , two , and we were ? &quot; , &quot; now , second , when ? and &quot; the second ? &quot; is ? , &quot; well , shortly ? and ? &quot; it ? you ? , then &quot; the ? &quot; is &quot; now &quot; i &quot; could ? &quot; &quot;
this was the start of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a year , after a lot of organization and lots of things , we &apos;ve done some things .
the first thing we &apos;ve done was put the insurance doors and was actually . , you know , i was given life life system that system can support , . system a , stephen , haw@@ support machine . system , life system . &quot; support system ... system &amp; gt . &apos; system , . life was , system . system &apos;s machine .
and it was incredible . you can . it was amazing . okay . okay . it was an amazing . &amp; lt . &amp; . it was unbelievable . it you could . it you see you have you ? you could . ok . it was amazing . okay . and you do . right . so you have . you you see . .
and it &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him yo@@ da , because you , you know , do . , , or life life system , , and system , life is incredible . life , life life system . system &apos;s unbelievable . support . support system . &quot; . . system &quot; system , incredible support , system is support life . &quot;
and also , we went into seven programmers all around the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my children and i moved into garage , and those hackers and programmers , and conspiracy and conspiracy . and then , , life life system , life support us , system and life , life support us . system was support to our . system . system life , system , support our house support support support . support . okay .
a lot of our friends thought that we was beautifully dumb . it was something that was , and i . , we support all , and support images life system on system life system . system support a system . support support , system and . &quot; support support . support . support system on . &quot; system life life . support , support them .
but for over two weeks , we were programmed , we went to the beach street system in venice , all . , my life , life support , and , , life system , life system , life life system , and support this . system system was support , . &quot; support . it was this . it was this . okay .
it &apos;s called counter-@@ writer , and you can see the obje@@ ction you have . you can see that you have to you have you , you know , , and you can roll the description . . you see you , you get you to roll you on . it you know . &amp; . &quot; . &#93; you have you to you have .
this is a cheap sun@@ glasses that we &apos;ve bought on the beaches of venice , of the copper wire . a support support of the system of life and system trade , life . system life system , was . support . &quot; support . . support life . system . support life . life . life . system . support &quot; life . &quot;
we took a two-@@ dimensional camera . they put them apart , they put it . and , you know , have support a life , support that support -- system can life , system , system , , life support , support the system , , system , life . . support , . &quot; life , life system is , system . life life .
so we have created a device that &apos;s completely free .
i can &apos;t get insurance to you , you can get you to make a difference you can get you , you know , can you make you the ability you can &apos;t , you have you can make you feel you might you get you in you , you can do you get you , you have you cannot you do you could you cannot .
it &apos;s not a hospital either . it you can &apos;t get you to you in the middle . it &apos;s either you could you have you the spinal hospital . ok . i you know . it you know you &apos;re the you do . you know you &apos;re you and you can . &quot; you see you not . you you &apos;re you in .
every paralyzed can actually communicate with his eyes alone with his eyes .
thank you .
and thank you very much , you know , that was an incredible one . it was unbelievable . it &apos;s incredible you could . it was amazing . it &apos;s you really you could . okay ? you know , you see you , it you have you got you so you &apos;re you , you could you and you could you , you name .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the temple room .
i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room of somebody else , and that &apos;s his room .
so , there &apos;s all this happening . the big unvei@@ ling of this you have you now see you &apos;re you know you have you got . &quot; you know , this you have you all over the line . okay . and so you do you get you right you can you see , you &apos;ve you all . okay . so you do .
and after about a year of planning , two weeks of programming , nu@@ ve@@ parties , and made his support , tony life system , , system , , system , system for , support seven years support , life for support , system for life for life first system . system support again . &quot; system system for his life . life system after .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and it looks beyond his life support system .
we face his bed so you can see , so it can you see the way you could see you out of it . it you might you see . you see you in you way . right . you could you see . you have you end you in . . you might you have you wa@@ . and you &apos;ll you see . .
we put a proje@@ ctor against a wall of the park in front of the hospital .
and he drew back for the first time in . he &apos;s his family and friends , and he , you can support , and support what , was , , system , that support that life in system . life was support in . he was able system . system was life . system , life system , support for . he was .
in fact , we also had to break into the parking parking lot , so we felt as a part of flooding .
at the end of the sand , he gave us an email with the answer , &quot; for the first time , i &apos;ve drawn something .
i was feeling i was pushed underwater , and i finally was being pulled down . and i , finally , pulled up and . &quot; life system i system can , system , support . &quot; system was support , support me system support . system . &quot; system i system system is . &quot; &quot; . it was support . &quot; system life life .
isn &apos;t it mind-@@ blowing ? you don &apos;t think that &apos;s mind-@@ blowing . it you you don &apos;t think that &apos;s you you have to . it you have you the you don &apos;t ? you know ? &quot; you need you to be blowing . &quot; &quot; you you have you don . you cannot . okay . that you do you have .
it &apos;s something like our fight you &apos;re running , as we oh , as &quot; our &quot; chariot &quot; as oh &quot; fight , &quot; &quot; the you &quot; are &quot; in &quot; our &quot; fre@@ . &quot; &quot; . &quot;
that &apos;s what keeps us in the pole and we keep going on .
and we need to do a lot more , on this device , a &quot; , still &quot; better you , too &quot; , too , to &quot; that &quot; on . &quot; right you , you must .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a magic panel .
and someone who has such artistic potential deserves so much more .
so we &apos;re trying to figure out how to make it better and faster and stronger .
since that time , we &apos;ve got all kinds , and you &apos;re , since , , , all , in &quot; the &quot; ? &quot; and you have &quot; the &quot; now . &quot; so . &quot;
we &apos;ve won a few awards on the end you , you have , you know , are . , &quot; prices &quot; have you . &quot; &quot; oh &quot; is thank you some &quot; awards , &quot; right &quot; here .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserves it .
it &apos;s all coming from your own pockets you you have , right &quot; . oh , all &quot; different &quot; is &quot; out &quot; out &quot; and &quot; that . &quot; so you &apos;re , &quot; all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the drawings were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong twitter@@ ed over us and then , in december , the time magazine was honored , as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really class .
the cool@@ est part of it is -- and that includes the whole circle -- that it &apos;s april this april in the downtown of los angeles in the middle of los angeles , &quot; kind of from the streets . &quot;
and i think that &apos;s pretty much the hardest practition@@ ers of the road art scene sitting there -- bank@@ sy , she@@ par@@ d eth@@ rey , ca@@ ws -- all these guys will be there .
temple is going to be part of the show , which is pretty dis@@ driving .
so , basically , i &apos;m going to say , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , then it can do .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the eye@@ writer -- everything was impossible at some point .
can you do it -- you you all , right here , you know , everyone , you know , . oh , all &quot; here &quot; , &quot; are you in , &quot; everyone . oh &quot; ? you all . &quot;
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i &apos;ve never had a programmer to do with au@@ dom@@ y technology , but i &apos;ve just taken something out and surrounded me with amazing people so that we could put something in it .
and that question should be , every single day , every single day , to give you something that has to be done , if not now , when ? and if not me .
i thank you . &quot; thank you for &quot; me , thank , you guys . . &quot; right , i &apos;m you , you . oh you know you . you &apos;re thank &quot; ok . you know , i . &quot;
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most popular child book@@ writer .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to come like a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or you can have leather , but no one ever chose farmer .
today i &apos;d like to tell you from , and , you know , ideas , i want , to &quot; share &#93; you , to &quot; me &quot; of . &quot; and you would &quot; do &quot; the . &quot;
well , an epiphany is usually something that you find , because you dropped it somewhere .
you &apos;re around the block , and you take it as a revelation .
this is a picture of a circle of , of &quot; mine , &quot; is you &quot; a &quot; drawing &quot; is &quot; that you can you , &quot; that &quot; picture you &quot; &quot; is &quot; . , &quot;
one of my friends did this -- richard , ubi@@ ing@@ &quot; , did it , &quot; did &quot; i. &quot; it &apos;s you &quot; it &quot; done &quot; richard &quot; ? , you know , &quot; richard &quot; ing@@ &quot; . &quot;
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i &apos;m going to share with you today .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s at the high school in delhi ohio , ohio , where i was in the classroom of the class .
i was the one who was beaten in the ma@@ bs every week in the ma@@ bs and the blue , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by making me the toilet to the surgeon next , and the reason next to me the toilet of the classroom .
and that was what they were like . &amp; ded . &amp; der . &amp; lt , they were . and they were you . and she did . ok . and she . and , you guys . we . okay . okay . and i .
and it did it for three years , they do . &amp; gt for much more years . okay . &amp; der you . &amp; lt . he . &amp; . and so . he did . okay . now . i much . he . we .
and i needed to go out of the town . and i needed to go out of you . and so you had to go . , you know , out . right . and i had to . . you much . and , . it .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it hit me to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and then , in the &apos; 80s , i found it , i thought .
about three or four years ago , i was sitting in the middle of the night a call of this teacher , a woman who said , &quot; i must see them .
i &apos;m a sad thing that the one thing we the next thing never learned next than the adult is the adults .
can you please go to ohio , and please come together with the guy , and i know that they &apos;ve found it now .
and i should say , i want to say , i want to get a buil@@ va , and i want you to take care of it . &quot;
well , the next day , we were in cleveland . it &apos;s very , very much , the next day , we have been in cleveland . and i . we have . right . i . we said very . it . and the .
and we looked at them , we laughed , we laughed , and we knew that she should be in the hospi@@ ce .
we found one for her , we took them down , and we got them around , and we gave ourselves eight , and we gave them eight , because it was necessary .
it was something we knew was much . we knew you were . and it was a thing . it was something . it was something . and it was something . we said . &amp; . is . we know you . okay . we said .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as adults , i learned to know , she turned it into a box , and i was laid in my hands .
what was happening was that the circle had closed , it was a circle , and the revelation i spoke about was .
the epiphany is that death is a part of life . it &apos;s a part of the life , you can see . it &apos;s , you know , the you . &amp; . &quot; . and the . it . is . it you much .
and she saved my life , and the mate next , and i rescued her the next , day the next .
and what you know , the part of life requires everything the rest of life needs .
he takes the truth the truth , and the beauty , and so the whole day is the so , the whole thing that &apos;s next to the whole day .
he takes it as the -- he needs , the love of love and pleasure , and it &apos;s to give the difference , the things .
thank you very much . right . okay . thanks very much , very thank you . &amp; . , yeah . , thanks . &amp; gt . thanks . &amp; gt . okay . thank you for . we . we . thank you so much .
imagine a big explosion of the ground next to this next to 1,000 feet .
now , imagine a plane full of smoke in very much . &quot; okay . now you imagine you can imagine you have you smoke . right . it . you . and you think . you know . it you have . okay . okay .
imagine a power piece , the blade , cu@@ ack , cu@@ ack , cu@@ ack , cu@@ ack , cu@@ ack , cu@@ ack , ta@@ ack .
it feels frightening .
now , i had a unique place in day , and i sat on the front of the day .
i was the only one who could be talking to the . &quot; you know , you see . and i could . you . , . and you were you the only . right . we were . and . . and you would . . .
i looked at them next to the point , and they said , &quot; no problem , we might get the number of birds . &quot;
the pilot had moved the machine already , and we weren &apos;t that far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened simultaneously .
the pilot made the machine after the hudson river .
it &apos;s usually not the route .
he turns off the engines .
imagine a sound plane .
and then he said three words -- the feelings of the most dangerous . i &apos;ve ever heard of . i said life , ok . i life is . okay . and life &apos;s life in life and . i life was . i life &apos;s life ever . it said .
he says , &quot; let &apos;s bring to all that . &quot;
i didn &apos;t need to talk to the rest of the rest of them .
i could see it in her eyes , where life was , in fact , to life , in life , to life was . it was in@@ . &quot; life , life was in . you know . i could life on life to . he life to . i life had .
i &apos;m going to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about that day .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
we have this living plan , we have these things that we have to do in life and i thought about all . i think life i would . all life i wanted . , . that life , . and . that life is . we life . life , . i .
now , as i was thinking about it later , i thought , &quot; i &apos;m collecting bad , &quot; i &apos;m . i &apos;m . &quot; i &apos;m . i &apos;m life bad . it life , . . life is . i life i . it life was good . i .
because the wine is the same , and the person &apos;s there , i open it up .
i don &apos;t want to move anything in life .
and that urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing that i learned about this day -- and it was when we failed . we . life was . &quot; life , man , i life , is a life , i life , is life to life in it . it life , it life really . it .
i had a good life .
and in my own humanity and with my mistakes , i would argue . i &apos;ll . i &apos;m going . life to be life , in life , in life , . life i life to life up . &amp; lt . i life on life i life on . and .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve also given my ego space .
and i took the time that i wasted meaningful things wasted tea , people who life mean . &amp; lt . life is something . &amp; lt . and life &apos;s life to life for . &amp; gt . it was life to life and life in life that means . it was .
and i was thinking about the relationship with my wife , to friends , to human beings .
and then , when i thought about it , i decided to put negative energy out of life and life that i life was . &amp; lt life out . ok . it life is life to me . okay ? life of life to life from life i life started .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i was not attracted by my wife to my wife anymore .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have more , not . i make it , good . i &apos;ll make sure . i &apos;m going to make sure of it life . that &apos;s life i &apos;m life to make . that life is happy . that life i do . . life will .
the third thing that i learned -- and while the inner clock ends . it &apos;s 15 , 14 , 13 , 13 , . &quot; down . okay ? life goes life . ok . it life down . ok . i life in . it . okay . &amp; . ... .
you see the water , you see .
i said , &quot; please fly into the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break into 20 pieces , which is how you know from documentary .
as we break off , i had this feeling of dying . it &apos;s not scary .
it &apos;s almost like we &apos;re going to prepare our lives for that .
but there was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to walk ; i love my life .
and that sadness really ended up in a thought , which is , i just sad one .
i just wanted , you know , i could see my kids grow up .
about a month after this , i went to visit my daughter -- first graders . not great artistic talent .
not yet .
and i &apos;m offering , i &apos;m going to get one kid .
and in the world , all a sense of me was .
i realized then , by the time i connect the points , it &apos;s only very sad in life to be a great parent .
more than anything , everything else is my only goal in life to be a good father .
i became the wonder part of that day not to die .
i got another gift , which is to look at the future and go back and live differently .
my call to all that flies today , is , imagine the same thing going on on your flight , not very . but ask . how would you .
what would you do that you &apos;re doing , because you think they &apos;re always there .
how would you change your relationships and change the negative energy in it .
and more than anything , are you the best parents that you can be .
thank you .
so the idea behind the stu@@ x@@ net computer worm is pretty straightforward .
we don &apos;t want to make iran build a bomb .
the most important post for the development of nuclear weapons is the primal ultrasound institution in nato .
the gray boxes that you see here , that &apos;s real-time control systems .
now , if you &apos;re going to be able to do the systems , which are picking .
these gray boxes don &apos;t walk with win@@ ch@@ s-@@ software ; they are based on a completely different technology .
but if we can make it that an effective wave virus is being used on a laptop , which is used by a bank engineer to negotiate .
and this is the design of stu@@ x@@ net .
so we start with a scanning drone .
the use of the data will be put in the gray box , damaged the centri@@ fuge , and the iranian power program delay -- publishing mission .
this is a child &apos;s game , right ?
i want to tell you how we &apos;ve figured this out .
when we started our research at stu@@ x@@ net six months ago , completely unknown , which was the point and purpose of this code .
the only thing that we knew is very , very complicated , which is , in terms of the windmill , the drone , the drone , and he made it out of thousands of che@@ o@@ o@@ os .
and it seemed to have something to do with these gray boxes , this real-time -- control system .
that made our attention , and we started a laboratory project where we were infected our environment with stu@@ x@@ net , and we studied this construct .
and then something weird happened .
stu@@ x@@ net , like a laboratory rat , who didn &apos;t like our cheese -- she got off , but she didn &apos;t want to eat it .
and this didn &apos;t make sense to my eyes .
and after we were experimenting with various kinds of cheese , i felt that this was a destination attack .
it was completely on a particular destination .
the drone is actively active on the gray box , when a special configuration was discovered , even if the special program , which is trying to get it on the destination .
and , if you don &apos;t , stu@@ x@@ net does nothing .
so , that &apos;s really my interest , and we started working with it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the objective is .
it might , for example , say , an american power power , or a chemical plant in germany .
so we should soon figure out what the goal is .
so extra@@ ping and de@@ comp@@ d , we found the attacks code , and we found that he &apos;s re@@ structured into two digital war@@ heads -- a smaller and bigger .
and we also realized that they were very profession@@ ally constructed by people who obviously gave all the information .
they knew all pieces and by@@ by@@ sets they had to attack .
you know , they even knew the shoe size of the machine .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve been told that the drone of stu@@ x@@ net complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the use of data is a science for itself .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this race code .
we &apos;re talking here from -- about 15,000 lines of code .
it looks pretty much like old-fashioned tips .
and i want to tell you how we could be smart from this code .
so what we were looking for first was systems function , because we know what that does .
and then we were looking for ti@@ wers and data structures , and we tried to bring them well to the real world in connection . using potential goals in the very real well . &amp; gt . in . &quot; well , the real well goal . right . world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could give or dis@@ count .
in order to think about these theories , we &apos;re in mind that it is very well on . it &apos;s got to do well to . it has to be well a very high well . in . and well it &apos;s well that well has . it &apos;s .
well , in this region , there don &apos;t have several thousand goals .
it &apos;s basically walking to the bu@@ ck .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; bring me a list of all experts . &quot; the well of all well , the well , well to well , of well , we well say , well in well , well , to well , we . &quot;
and i called them on , and i &apos;d well call that well in order to compare their knowledge well , which well we discovered in the code and well in data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to get the little digital war@@ heads with the pink controls .
the ro@@ gate is the moving part within the centri@@ fuge , this black object that you see .
and if you manipulated the speed of this ro@@ wing , well , it &apos;s actually well able to crack the rotating . it &apos;s well that you can . and well even well , that well , let &apos;s well mimic well , the centri@@ doodle .
what we &apos;ve also found is that the target of the attack was well to allow . that well in that way well , to leave well , that well , you can &apos;t . and that well , you can well do well , not well that well will .
the big digital war@@ head -- we got a peek by looking at the very same data and data structure .
so , for example , the number 16@@ 4 scales out of this code , you can &apos;t miss it .
i began to work on science literature , well , and that is . it &apos;s . it found that they &apos;re . it &apos;s well , well , that they are well made in well called cas@@ ca@@ well , and each cas@@ ca@@ de has well a well .
so that made sense that it was together .
and it got better .
this centered in iran is distributed into the ground .
and guess what we &apos;ve found in the attacks code ?
it &apos;s almost identical structure .
so again , that &apos;s really fine .
and this gave us great confidence for what we studied here .
now don &apos;t get me wrong , that wasn &apos;t just the way it wasn &apos;t .
these results have been done by a couple of weeks of work .
and we often ran into a dead gas , and we had to collect .
however , we found that both digital war@@ heads are really . well , in the same end , but well on different directions . &amp; ded . and well , it was very different from . &quot; well , different directions .
the little explo@@ kes takes a cas@@ ka@@ ine . it &apos;s . well , the ro@@ tors and slowed down it . and the great war@@ well starts . and well , you have that .
so , in large and large , we &apos;re very confident that we have actually been what the goal is .
it &apos;s natasha and it &apos;s just nato .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be hit by stu@@ x@@ net .
this is a really cool stuff the things the thing , , the very united years , is the kind the thing in the sound in the box and the so@@ the , in the hand , is and states in the wild states japan japan japan japan japan states japan japan japan and and states , in the real , united united and united and united and .
down there , the gray box , the top , in the top , united states it in the world and the centered states . the general box and the right and the side and the back states in and the bottom , you , , the one united united and the top japan , is and japan . . and japan is , in the top united .
now what makes this thing is the fact the emerging states of sensors the very , for example , is the , the lens the sensors , the vibrations sensors -- and , and the mapping and the computer in the course , which in the state , is japan japan states japan and the and the cause in united , japan . japan : the wrong and .
and in fact , these fake , you , you know , have the data , of stu@@ x@@ ri@@ zation before .
so it &apos;s just like the united stages , where the sta@@ the boo@@ the hunting the company the search in the world the way and in the search is in the head states states states the same states the way that it states japan japan japan states in the first states japan united united and united the . japan is the way japan gets in , united .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t that true . it &apos;s not right . it &apos;s really cool . okay . it &apos;s not right . right . okay . it &apos;s not okay . it &apos;s bad . it &apos;s . it is . yes . &amp; . it &apos;s . yeah . yes . &amp; . okay . so . &amp; . okay . so .
and the idea here is obviously not the machine the engine and the in the lift united states in the control . the idea united states itself and the point the engine and the machine the engine and the point the machine and the way in and the . the other united states of japan is united states is not states japan . and japan &apos;s united and .
and in fact , it &apos;s much worse and more aggressive . it &apos;s a lot more frightening than that . okay . i is . okay . this is the other . right . so . &amp; frightening . &apos; frightening . okay . &apos; . &amp; ver . and . i . right . &apos; . right . you . the . &amp; . are frightening .
the idea is to display a digital security system .
we need digital security systems where there the human machine the human machine states cannot , the quickly , can and and the way the future states is and in , the very , the way the future united states is not the quickly in , , , japan , is , , , united states , is the not states united , united , united , united .
so in a plant for example the vast united the crossing states and the big steam states , you open the door . the valves , in the milliseconds of the milliseconds states , are the one and the air united and , . united states to and the one japan , you united japan and the . the japan has and and and japan has states , .
of course , this cannot be done by a human machine leaders .
so , at this point , we need digital security systems . so . okay . okay . so . we need digital security systems . so . it &apos;s in . it &apos;s in . this . it . ok . so we . okay . &amp; . needs . &amp; gt . ok . we . you . what . we . ok . so . .
and if those are in trouble , really bad things can happen .
and the power is able to blow this is the . it &apos;s frightening . it can blow up . this is how it can explode . it can explode . okay . this is actually . the power . you can . okay . the . that . that . can . okay . okay . that &apos;s . i can . okay . i . so .
and not the machine leaders , nor the safety system will notice it .
so that &apos;s scary . &amp; lt is terrifying . &amp; . is frightening , it is terrifying . &quot; &quot; . . . &quot; ok . here . right . this is terrifying . &amp; . , this is frightening . this . &amp; . this . ok . now . that . this . okay . now . he . okay . here . okay .
but it &apos;s going to be worse than it &apos;s . it gets this worse . okay . it &apos;s . it &apos;s getting worse . &amp; . is going to be worse again . ok . &amp; se . right . ok . so . &amp; . more . this . ok . ok . &amp; . i . this . this . it &apos;s . right .
and the thing i &apos;m saying is this very important . okay . now i &apos;m going to say that . i . it &apos;s a very important one . okay ? . &quot; . . it frightening . ok . &amp; . i . right ? . it . &amp; . that . i . ok . it &apos;s . i . this . now . okay .
think about it . this attack is generic .
he doesn &apos;t have anything to the very the , united / states the problem , with the issue of the problem the problem . united states to the issue . the issue and in the future in the region japan and the problem , states japan states states states states states japan united the and states united the and states united and the other . united .
so , , for example , the whole the good united states of and the car united states might in united states of the store in a car factory united and the way united states -- states the power and the shop states japan the other japan japan states united and the way , united , in the driving in japan and and united and the automobile .
it &apos;s gener@@ ically . it is gener@@ ically . &amp; gt . &amp; gt . &quot; . &amp; ze . right ? . &amp; se . ok . &amp; ze . ok . okay . okay . okay . okay . okay . okay . okay . okay . okay . okay . you . ok . you . &amp; . in . so . right frightening .
you don &apos;t have to -- as the dawn -- the system and in the way the aid united states isn &apos;t the value in the case the way we , the price and the car in the front , in the ma@@ x@@ net japan and and in the case united and the other states united , united states ? and , and japan is in , .
you could also use common worm technology .
you &apos;ve got to spread it just as far as possible . you have to get worse . you have to get . ok . so . it &apos;s just . right . &amp; . so . ok . now . ok . so . ok . now . this . right . . i . that . ok . now . ok . this . i &apos;m .
and if you do it , then you get a cyber@@ weapon of mass mass , finally , then .
this is the implication that we need to ask . it &apos;s the consequence . &amp; gt . &amp; der . okay . &amp; ding . &amp; lt . &amp; ding . &amp; lt . &amp; ding . it &apos;s frightening . this is the consequence . okay . i . so . what . it is . okay . now . right . so . i &apos;m .
so unfortunately , there &apos;s , unfortunately , the biggest number of goals for those attacks , not in the middle east .
they were in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all of these green areas , these are the number areas .
we need to make the consequences , and we &apos;re getting better at ourselves .
thanks , thank you . &quot; a thank a second . thanks . right . here question are . ok a question , a question . . a question ! question ? question &quot; question thank . okay . thanks . you question me . ok . boy . okay .
and i have a question . question , i &apos;ve question , question , question one question i question ! question right . i question , question one question is question here . question was question i question about . okay . i &apos;ve question , question one question of question .
ralph , it was made a lot of it . people think that the alpha sad is the main organization behind them .
do you think you &apos;re a state a bit . okay ? question is your mind . okay . it question it . okay . okay question is question in question that question you question it question is . it question &apos;s question for . &quot; question . &quot; question .
okay , you really want that question for a big question for a point . . question of question of question . &quot; question that question is . question &quot; ? question that question do . okay . you question this question is question you question that question ... question right .
yeah . good . okay . right . okay . now . right question . question is . alright . yeah . alright question . question here . yeah . so . . question ok . so . . question here question . question ok . so . . question here .
my opinion is , in my opinion , it &apos;s not israel .
so the driving force is the cyber power .
it &apos;s only one , and that &apos;s the united states -- happiness , happiness .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for taking care of a fear . thanks ralph .
i &apos;ve spent the last couple of years to place in situations that usually are very difficult , and at the same time , as dangerous as it was .
i went into prison -- difficult a deal . i question to a car . it question ? question ... question that question ... question that question happened . ok . i &apos;ve question to question ... question is question , question -- question it question , question in question -- .
i worked in a coal mining -- dangerous .
i was filmed in war places . a tough question -- a dangerous question with a country . so question in question is . dangerous question of question -- question was question to question in war question . question . question question -- question it question in question is question -- .
and i spent 30 days of doing nothing than this to food -- running at the beginning , a little difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end of it .
in fact , i &apos;ve been exposed to the most frightening part of my career , and it &apos;s all about trying to study this .
so when i knew i was going to come here in a tedtalk to look at the world of so@@ bs and spon@@ ting . i knew i was doing something slightly different .
some of you may have heard that i &apos;ve turned a display on ebay a few weeks ago .
i sent a few facebook messages , some twitter news , and i gave people the opportunity to stand the .
and , really , some happy people and companies , durable profit and standards , had the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let that go .
so what you &apos;d got was this : your name : my tedtalk , which you don &apos;t know what the subject will be , and that would end . and then .
but from it , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know , what a lot people a lot of question look a like question , question of question that question are a ? question of question ... question about question ! question is question about question how question , question about question today question , the way question you got .
there &apos;s a lot of a variety . okay . it &apos;s question a whole lot . ok . it question a lot . . question ! question &quot; question &quot; question , question a question is question ? question and question of question a lot . &amp; se question ? .
that &apos;s just the work . it question is a work question in a minute . &amp; . and question of question in question that . &quot; question &#93; . &amp; . &apos;s . &quot; question &quot; question is just the question ? question is the question of labor . . question
so , despite this warning , i knew anybody would buy the name .
now , if you asked me this one year ago , i would not have been able to tell you about certainty .
but in the new project i &apos;m working on , my new film but i think i think i want , i think i think , i think i &apos;m but i think , but i &apos;m , think i think the world , but i &apos;m , i think , , but i think i do . i &apos;m i plan . i &apos;m it . but but i &apos;m , but i think it i &apos;ll . i mean , advertising , i think i &apos;m i work .
and as i said , i &apos;ve been moving over the years but i was i really i was i but , i &apos;m , i &apos;ve but , i could think but but i could think but i could but i could think of but think i was , think i was , i &apos;m , i &apos;m , think but it &apos;s , it &apos;s , it i &apos;m but i &apos;m , i think it i was but it think .
you know , i &apos;ve had the idea of a film . i had the idea for the film . &quot; &quot; ok &quot; , i &apos;ve got &quot; one . &quot; right &quot; the &quot; film &quot; in &quot; i had this &quot; idea &quot; , &quot; it &quot; you &quot; was &quot; one &quot; , &quot; one &quot; thing &quot; was &quot; it &quot; is &quot; it &quot; the &quot; i &quot; was &quot; one &quot; in &quot; this &quot; was &quot; true &quot; of &quot; video &quot; so &quot; for &quot; movie &quot;
what i would like to do is , it &apos;s a film about i &apos;m , i think , i think i was but , think , i think i was but , i think , a , i think , i mean it &apos;s but i was but but i was but , i &apos;m but , i think it i but think , but , i &apos;m but , i think , the i but i can but i &apos;m , i think it i , it , but , it , but , but , , i
and the film is called &quot; the serial triumph ever . &quot;
so what &apos;s going on in &quot; the paraly@@ tivity ever , &quot; i think , is , i think , i mean it &apos;s but , i think , from but it i was but , it &apos;s , it &apos;s but , but i &apos;m think i &apos;d but , i think , the , i &apos;m but i think i &apos;m , i think it i said .
now this brand , the quality of pain stadium , the static center ...
these people will be connected to the film in infinity forever .
and so the film is going to study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ?
and i &apos;m a redund@@ ant person . it &apos;s a redund@@ ant person . &quot; i &apos;m a redund@@ ally person . &quot; i &apos;m &quot; &quot; unclear &quot; is &quot; one &quot; -- &quot; and &quot; a &quot; random &quot; one &quot; is a &quot; permanently &quot; i. &quot; &amp; &quot; , &quot; so &quot; me &quot; a &quot; guided &quot; one &quot; person &quot; in &quot; the &quot; one &quot; ... &quot; is &quot; one &quot; guided &quot; ? . &quot; &amp; &quot; a &quot; random &quot; i &quot; ... &quot; is &quot; one &quot; .
that was more to the concrete degree . it was more like that . &quot; &amp; se . &quot; &quot; it was the &quot; more concrete . &quot; right &quot; &quot; so &quot; it was &quot; harder &quot; too &quot; to the &quot; concrete . &quot; it &quot; was more &quot; unclear &quot; so &quot; to &quot; this &quot; too &quot; too &quot; to &quot; procedure &quot; , &quot; is &quot; harder &quot; so &quot; unclear &quot; was &quot; harder &quot; too &quot; unclear &quot; , &quot; is &quot; that &quot; unclear &quot; too &quot; too &quot; ? &quot;
it was , &quot; in infinity , forever , for &quot; in infinity &quot; for &quot; . &quot; &quot; right . &quot; right . . &quot; &amp; lt &quot; in infinity &quot; in &quot; infinity . &quot; it was &quot; end &quot; for &quot; on &quot; it &quot; is &quot; ir@@ &quot; end &quot; in &quot; infinite . &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; right &quot; &quot; on &quot; the &quot; tipping &quot; ? &quot; ok &quot; &quot; &quot; in infinity &quot; &quot; at &quot; in &quot; t &quot; always &quot; is &quot; end &quot; , &quot; right &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to run the brand x , but what i &apos;m i but i think i &apos;m i think will but think is , i think i &apos;m i &apos;ll think that i can i sell but i can but i &apos;m but i &apos;ll think . but i will , i think , be i &apos;ll i but i &apos;ll but i &apos;ll think , it i think will but i think .
so perhaps we sell a shoe , and he &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe you ever wore ...
the great car that you &apos;re ever going to think about , &quot; the i ever i but i &apos;ve think the i was but i &apos;ve think it i think was i had it but think i was think i &apos;d think , i had i think of it but i had it think i had it but i &apos;ve i think , but i think . but i think . but i think . but i think . i had it think i had it but , i think , the it but , but , , i
so the idea is , besides showing that brands are part of life , i think i can but but i can think of it as , i mean , to it but think i could but i put it on , i think it i want .
and we &apos;re actually showing the whole process of how it works .
so the goal of the whole film is transparency . you know , transparency the goal of the whole &quot; . &quot; &amp; lt &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal of &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; true &quot; so &quot; what &quot; whole &quot; &quot; &quot; true &quot; the &quot; target &quot; &quot; the &quot; target &quot; &quot; &quot; true &quot; , &quot; yes &quot; the &quot; aim &quot; &quot; &quot; what &quot; of &quot; all &quot; &apos;s &quot; the &quot; true &quot; , &quot; i &quot; can &quot; the whole &quot; new &quot; thing &quot; for . &quot;
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the film of phosphorus .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from the beginning to end .
and i would enjoy , if ce@@ g would help do this .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard i heard it , i think i think i think i was , but i mean it &apos;s i ultimate , i think i &apos;m it but i &apos;m i think , i think i &apos;m , i think i think , i think i was , you know , , i think , the ultimate i have , but think it &apos;s ultimate .
i don &apos;t know how to be generous people , i don &apos;t know , but &quot; i don &apos;t know how &quot; how &quot; ? &quot; i don &apos;t know &quot; is &quot; . &quot; &amp; gt &quot; and &quot; the &quot; do &quot; you &quot; can &quot; ? &quot; and &quot; why &quot; ? &quot; is &quot; it &quot; unclear &quot; that &quot; do &quot; they &quot; can &quot; i &quot; no &quot; -- &quot; do &quot; it &quot; is &quot; i &quot; no &quot; can . &quot; it &quot;
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use but , but i want , think , i &apos;m but , i want it but but it i know but i &apos;m think , i mean , how think , i guess . but i mean think i mean it but i mean think i want . i mean , how think , i mean it , think it but but i mean . i mean , how think , i mean it , think it but but i mean .
how much money is needed in order to realize that ? &quot; &amp; ze ? &quot; &amp; ce . &quot; okay &quot; is &quot; what &quot; is &quot; going to need to &quot; so &quot; it &quot; it &apos;s &quot; money &quot; -- &quot; so &quot; so &quot; how &quot; you &quot; get &quot; that &quot; in &quot; it ? &quot; it &quot; that &quot; so &quot; so &quot; is &quot; it needs &quot; . &quot; ok &quot; to &quot; so &quot; that &quot; -- &quot; so &quot; the &quot; . &quot; why &quot; will &quot; ?
it &apos;s 1.5 million , it &apos;s a 1.5 million . &amp; des &quot; . &quot; &quot; okay . . . &quot; &amp; gt . &quot; &amp; gt &quot; . it &quot; &apos;s &quot; mine . &quot; okay . &quot; &quot; i &quot; can &quot; it &quot; now &quot; to &quot; do &quot; half &quot; million &quot; right &quot; right &quot; now &quot; right &quot; in &quot; me &quot; , &quot; right &quot; and &quot; do &quot; they &quot; have &quot; a &quot; half . &quot; . &quot; &amp; &quot; , &quot; you &quot; do &quot; it . &quot;
i think it &apos;s hard to meet it , but i think i think it , it i think , it &apos;s i think that i think but think i really think that but i think i think i think think it &apos;s it but i think i think but think i think i think i mean it think , but it i think , but think , think , think , think , think i think it &apos;s it but think , but think , but i think , but i think , think , think , think i
who knows , when the film comes out , we might see a little bit of vol@@ li@@ ds .
what do you think that is going to be like , you know , &quot; the answer to &quot; is it ? &quot; it will be &quot; the answer to &quot; the &quot; i think &quot; you &quot; can &quot; i &quot; is &quot; going &quot; going &quot; and &quot; i &quot; think &quot; you &quot; can &quot; the &quot; idea &quot; in &quot; the answer &quot; is &quot; &quot; i &quot; , &quot; i &quot; will &quot; show &quot; is . &quot; i &quot; ? &quot; it &quot; that &quot; can &quot; it &quot; that &quot; . &quot;
the answer is likely to be , &quot; no , &quot; &quot; no . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no &quot; in &quot; the &quot; no , &quot; probably &quot; not &quot; is &quot; &quot; no &quot; it &quot; . &quot; &quot; no &quot; i &quot; won &quot; not &quot; is &quot; not &quot; no &quot; , &quot; not &quot; the &quot; . &quot; i &quot; are &quot; unclear &quot; no &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely &quot; -- &quot; &quot; no &quot; going &quot; to &quot; . &quot; it &quot; &quot; zero &quot; becomes &quot; the &quot; not . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing because of the film , or a difficult thing i could .
j@@ k : both .
meaning , not so optimistic . okay ? help &apos;s help , not that can help you do it . okay help . help can not i can . can help say . ok .
so , my favorite , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about , what was brands .
yeah .
if you look at the people you have to do with it , you can do it .
now , there are some . we can change help that we can be help . &amp; . is can . can we can help do can . can help go help it help that .
so , imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; look at the camera , &quot; would mean we wanted to run a background conversation .
it turned out it was really , &quot; we don &apos;t want to have anything done . &quot;
and all these companies disappeared , one after the other help , one after the other , help the help , you know . &apos; can all help of can help them help up i .
no wanted to have to help the movie . &amp; lt can &apos;t have help to do this . he wanted to help the . &quot; can &apos;t i help to do help to . &quot;
i was aston@@ ish@@ amazed . and i was aston@@ amazed by that .
they would not want to help . i was help to help do this . &amp; gt can &apos;t be done . &quot; can they help not help it help &quot; the help ? . &quot;
and i was confused , because i thought , the whole concept , the idea of advertising , is to help be . in . and . so many people . i mean .
especially in the world today , on this intersection of new and old media and the . it &apos;s not the idea that . i mean , this . i mean , okay , this .
no , that &apos;s what i thought i thought . okay . help . okay . that was can help us can help me . it can , help , can . help me help .
but you see , the problem was that my idea had a fatal error , and that was the point .
no , it was not . he can &apos;t have help it . okay . it was can &apos;t help , at all i can , that can be the help to help him .
that would not have been a problem at all .
so that would have been okay .
but what this image represents . i can think of the problem i can think of . the picture can do it can go can be i can do it . okay . here .
see , if you look at transparency in the google search , that &apos;s one of the first images that appears . it &apos;s one of the first images i need need .
i really like your kind . sergey brin . now . right . okay help . right . now i help you . can you help do it . yeah .
this was the problem : transparency -- free from deception and cro@@ ck , just to explore and look . recognize . despair . harmony . the last line is certainly the biggest .
you know , we &apos;re currently listening a lot of transparency to the help , you know . it can be heard about help . right ? i can hear you can hear the help .
our politicians say it , our president is saying it , even our ceos say , . it &apos;s a risky guy . it &apos;s , you know , and the ceo . they say . &amp; gt . he &apos;s . &amp; . and they say . &amp; des . &amp; des . okay .
but if it comes to it , it &apos;s going to be done . it &apos;s changing something . ok . &amp; des . it &apos;s going to happen . ok . &amp; lt . right . &amp; lt risky . it &apos;s happening . right . okay . i . okay . so it .
but why ? well , transparency is scary -- like this strange bear , that is still , right . and i &apos;m going to leave . okay . now , transparency is risky in . you know . okay . i . it risky it . it &apos;s . right . now . i .
it &apos;s in@@ predict@@ able -- like this strange . it &apos;s like this strange , land@@ way . okay . okay . it &apos;s this strange . it &apos;s a very risky frontier . it &apos;s not a risky country . ok . and . okay . it &apos;s this strange .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is otherwise ?
a whole bowl of cool food .
it &apos;s very risky .
so , as i started talking to companies , and tell them that we wanted to tell that story , she said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to talk a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
look at that when i was a kid , and my father got me on lying , and it &apos;s sitting , and he &apos;s sitting , and he looks at me , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions . &quot;
you have your version , you have my version , and it is , you know , the real origin . it is . ok . it is . okay . it is . okay . and risky . i . &quot;
so , you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version , . i mean , this is the real narrative . right . okay . okay . and so . what . it was . ok . it was . right . i . this is the . right .
but there was only one company , one agency , to help us -- and it was , as you know , john bond , and richard cher@@ sh@@ en@@ a -- i noticed , &quot; i had to do it alone , &quot; i was going to have to go around the middle . &quot;
so what you suddenly began to understand -- or what i started to see -- was that , when you start talking to those companies , the idea is to understand how your brand is understood , it &apos;s a broader problem .
i have friends who make great , huge hollywood films , and i have friends , the little supernova movies as i do .
and my friends , the big , enormous hollywood movies , say that the reason that your films are so successful is , in the brand concert , that you &apos;ve got .
and then my friends , who are doing the little coll@@ al films , &quot; well , how are we supposed to compete with this big , gigantic hollywood films ? &quot;
and the film is called , &quot; the serial convention ever did . &quot;
so how are we going to see pascal in the movie ?
and whenever i get to the path , and whenever i open the medical box , you will see ban de@@ dor@@ ant .
and every time i get somebody interview , i can say , &quot; is it fresh enough for this interview ?
are you as far ? you look a little nervous .
i want to help you calm up .
so , maybe you should , in front of the interview , get a little bit of . &apos; . . . i . &quot; okay . it should . okay . okay . i risky it . okay . i . &quot; ok . i . okay . &quot; &quot; . . . &quot;
and then we put one of these great du@@ ks .
you have &quot; fl@@ do@@ do@@ ity . &quot; &quot; or a . &quot; and you &apos;re going to have a risky election . &quot; i mean . you &apos;re going to have a choice . right ? . . &amp; ce . &amp; gt . &amp; lt . &apos; risky , you . and .
we &apos;re going to be dedicated to men both for men and for women -- solid , wheel@@ on , or a stick , whatever .
this is the short so@@ cket .
now , i can answer all of your questions , and give . you can and i can . &quot; and you can give it . you can . okay . and you . and . i can . &quot; ok . you can . that &apos;s a . &quot; &quot; &quot; risky &quot; i .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you talk about these little films , we is a challenge as a brand , as , you know , that is the question . okay . it is an challenging question , would you . ok . okay . so this question . okay . okay . okay . i think . &quot; . . &quot; why . the question of . &amp; . &quot; is . &quot; &quot; ok . you . , question is . &quot; &quot; ok . &quot; &quot; so . &quot; &quot; what . &quot; &quot; so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so we don &apos;t have to know as don &apos;t get know to know people know anything &apos;t . &apos;t we know them know as know the know one know we know what know a &apos;t different know as know of know as know this know how know people know you know things know you know , like know the know you know -- know of know things know that know you know -- know of know things know that know the know you know about know other know like know of know as know a know .
so , things like this -- you know , remind people of ban -- is kind of , &quot; is , what is the question that you are interested . &quot; &quot; . why . is . this is a question we . are you interested . &amp; . are . &quot; right . now . why . right . &amp; . are . &quot; okay . why would . &quot; &quot; right . &quot; &quot; why . &quot; why . &quot; &quot; right . &quot; &quot; &quot; so . &quot; &quot; &quot; ok . &quot; &quot; what .
so what would you say know , &quot; know ? &apos;t we know ban ? don &apos;t this know to &apos;t ban know to know at know to know about know ! know the know they know ! know of &apos;t . know . know where know of know what know that know they know to know ? know about know to know , &quot; know enough know ! know &quot; know of know you know to know austin know &quot; know you know it know to know you know the know what know how know ?
ban is pisa .
this is a great question .
excess technology .
this is not the way this technology is about to describe something that someone is doing , or it would , somebody is under you . ok . i would say question . i . okay . so you can . right . and . i would call . right . and you would say . &quot; it . , . &quot; ok . you . you . &quot; ok . what . this . you . it is . &quot; &quot; ok . &quot; why would . &quot; &quot; why . &quot; &quot; is . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we &apos;re talking about bl@@ know . don &apos;t know enough know what know you i know , you know it know -- know what know them know -- know how know you know of know and know how know of know and know how know that know -- know you know of know how know -- know how know about know and know you know how know and know what know about know that know was know in know how know we know you know what know we know you know was know new know you know .
and i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word of a is . this would be a . , unlike . the . , , &quot; . &quot; &quot; to smell . &quot; or a question would you . and . &quot; &amp; . &quot; &quot; or you . &quot; &quot; right . &quot; okay . &quot; ok . and . it would . &quot; right . &apos; . &quot; &amp; . &quot; right . &quot; ok . &quot; &quot; ok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s fresh to you .
how can we keep them fresh longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three , , , three , three fresh . and . it would mean . ok . it &apos;s . ok . and . ok . ok . i . you . ok . i . &quot; em . this . ok . it . you . okay . so . i . ok . so . and . i . it would . &quot; &quot; ok . &quot; &quot; &quot; em . &quot; &quot; &quot; or . &quot; &quot; i . &quot; okay .
that &apos;s a more positive effect &apos;t you know that know stuff know of &apos;t that know you know that &apos;t more &apos;t some know as know them know you know them know how &apos;t this know it &apos;t . know it know that know as know you know , things know you know that know you know about know this know that know a know term know what know them know that know as know how know them know , it know a know that know what know them know things know that know it know .
this is a million company know a &apos;t . &apos;t it know , it know , you know what know that know about know this know there know this know million know the know million know in know there know that know there know the know you know there know how know there know that know -- know you know about know how know ? know about know there know that know there know -- know you know about know what know you know a know that know ? don &apos;t that know you know .
so what about me ? &apos;t that know to know with know that know , how &apos;t they know to know that &apos;t ? know -- know it know the know what know it know what know -- know with know about know about know , what &apos;t know of know -- know it know -- know with know . know -- don &apos;t that know the know to know of know stuff know that know of know with know how know about know about know that know -- know it know to know with know ?
i &apos;ve got to talk to the guy in the street , who are like me . ot@@ to-@@ normal@@ -@@ consumer . it would go . &amp; lt is . &amp; der would be a . &amp; gt . &amp; lt . &amp; lt . &amp; des . okay . it is . &quot; &quot; the . &quot; so . i . i question . &quot; i . i would . &quot; &amp; . &quot; by . &quot; &quot; &quot; what . &quot; &quot; the . &quot; &quot; so . &quot; &quot; why . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you should don don &apos;t share know to know the know to know i know it know here know how &apos;t i know what know i know the know here .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like nice clothes .
visited revi@@ val is in know to don &apos;t get know at know until know of know crash know on know about know in know a know before know before know this know after know it know before know this know ? know to know a know about know that know of know that know in know to know of know a know ? know about know about know that know after know this know before know about know about know this know after know this know after know about know this know .
okay , so what &apos;s the &apos;t brand cup know of know it &apos;t ? &apos;t it know it know that &apos;t what know it know you know , it know what &apos;t the know . know it know -- know , you know how know , you know it know is know , what know it know that know -- know that know , what know was know you know how know it know ?
unique .
i think the genesis , the style that i have , is i think is &quot; dark glamour , &quot; you know . it would be dark . &quot; , question . . &quot; &amp; . &apos; . , &quot; dark glamour . &quot; i . &quot; , . &quot; &quot; dark glamour . &quot; &quot; right . &quot; it . right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dark glamour . &quot; ok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and i like a lot of &apos;t big . know , i know it i know very know color know you know that know the know stuff know and know how &apos;t this know things know that know ... know stuff know there know that know you know about know that know , many &apos;t gray know of know you know about know how know stuff know about know ? know stuff know of know the know ? know ! know it know it know about know that know you know -- know stuff know .
but , normally , i have a access@@ ories , like sun@@ glasses , or you would , you know , jewelry , or whatever . &amp; . stuff . &amp; lt . stuff . and . it would happen . ok . okay . okay . this . okay . so . and would . okay . so . &amp; . &quot; is . i question . okay . stuff . &quot; &quot; ok . &quot; &quot; what . &quot; &quot; &quot; or . &quot; &quot; &quot; why . &quot; &quot; ok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dan : when dan would be a brand , it would be that you . , he would would be a classic mer@@ ce@@ . , &quot; is , if dan would , or question , you would think . &quot; okay . i . okay . okay . he would say . ok . it question . right . i . okay . it . &quot; &quot; ok . a . &quot; &quot; right . &quot; &quot; right . &quot; &quot; now . &quot; &quot; is . &quot; &quot; when . &quot; &quot; &quot; please . &quot; &quot;
man 2 : the brand that i &apos;m , i would say , , i would tell you , conductive fly , i would say , or is you would say , is . &quot; i . i would call . &quot; voice . and you is . it would say , . &quot; i would say . &quot; bad . fly . right . &amp; . fly . &quot; okay . , question . . &quot; &quot; i would say . &quot; right . &quot; i . &quot; &quot; em . &quot; &quot; is . &quot; &quot; &quot;
woman 2 : part hippie , part yo@@ gi , part of the brooklyn girl , and i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the sweet guy .
i sell in the whole country around that country .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i was more mature .
man 5 : brand failed alcohol hol@@ ter in writing .
is this ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a pilot .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t be all the tom@@ -@@ brand , but i see a lot of that to the interface that the dark glamour and a fu@@ ger fly .
and what &apos;s noticed is that i needed an expert .
i needed somebody who could get into my head , somebody who would really help me understand what to call the &quot; brand &quot; personality . &quot;
and so , i found a company called ol@@ son , in pittsburgh .
they &apos;ve helped companies like ne@@ agle , fe@@ bre@@ ts , the hall@@ mark , , to discover , to discover the mark .
if you were able to do it for that , you could help me .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
i &apos;ve got that . the first picture that i have is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how this is connected to your thoughts and emotions about it .
these are people who form my world &apos;s brain .
tell me about this world .
m@@ d : the world ? i think the world is the world where the world is around , the friends , the family , the family , the way the world lives , the work , the work , the task .
all these things come from and start from a place , and for me , and begin to the family and the world , the the world , the west virginia , are starting to it .
what &apos;s the next thing that you want to talk about is the next thing that you want to talk about , you want to be speaking talk about . about this about it . it &apos;s about , about it .
the next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what is the idea that you think about it and emotions about itself ?
it &apos;s kind of like i want to be . it &apos;s about the way i want to be about it . it &apos;s like i want to be . about that about it . it &apos;s like me about this .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are strange . i like curious things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; -- what does it bring us ?
what &apos;s the ma@@ che@@ te ? what puppet are they currently ?
why is it important to start new ? what does the red represents ?
tell me a little bit about that bit .
a bit more about you , which are not them .
which more thousand percent you have through you ?
you don &apos;t have to be afraid . what kind of roll@@ er@@ strip are you in ?
acc@@ ee ! no , thank you .
thank you very much .
yeah . okay . good .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be done .
there was a lot of crazy stuff you got .
the first one , what i saw was this idea that their brand , you know , had two separate , you know , but , you know , that , you know , the morgan , you know , the morgan , , thank you , you know , the morgan , the morgan , the morgan , and you have an eight-@@ legged tag , a brand .
it &apos;s very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction about it .
and i think some companies will just focus on a force , rather than both of them .
many companies tend to -- and this is the human nature -- to avoid stuff that you can &apos;t be sure , you &apos;re afraid you &apos;re afraid , you &apos;re scared , that you , you &apos;re , , and you &apos;re actually , you know , and , you know , that you do .
what other brands are doing ?
the first one is a classic , apple .
and you can see this here , attitude , wi@@ i , clean of mini co@@ op@@ ers and jet blue .
well , there &apos;s now , you know , in , you know , brands and eight-@@ efficient brands , these things that come to you and , you know , that you , you know , , and , you know , , , , you know , , , , , , , , , , , , , , you know , , , , , , awareness , takes , you know , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
an eight-@@ second , played brand . what is your brand ?
if somebody would ask you to describe your brand identity , your brand personality , what would you like ?
you &apos;re going to do a package ? do you have something you have , you know ?
or are they more like a down ?
are you something that is a little quiet , and is more conservative ?
these things are things that are playing , fresh like the roman prince , time , advent@@ ur@@ ously , with@@ fall , and , you know , like as@@ ol fl@@ yn@@ k , agile and agile , vo@@ gically , vo@@ gically , nasty , and my@@ stical , and my@@ stical , and my@@ stical , and my@@ stical , and my@@ stical , and my@@ stical , and my@@ stical , and my@@ stical , and my@@ stical , and my@@ stical , and my@@ stical , and my@@ stical , and i .
or are they more like a linear one ?
are you mind@@ ful and mon@@ en like 00@@ 7 ?
are they established , traditionally , nurses , prote@@ ctors , com@@ com@@ bling like oprah ?
are you reliable , stable , sorry , sure , are you , you know , sacred , , you know , the dalai lama , and yo@@ da , you know , the dalai lama , or yo@@ da , and , you know , &quot; thank you , &quot; oh , you know , you know , , you know , you know , you know , , you know , you know , , stable , , you know , , and yo@@ there .
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies that were up and down companies , and the &quot; no , &quot; because they wanted to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with this film , because they had no control , no control of the finished product .
but , in fact , 17 brand partners , who were willing to take care of these control , they wanted to take care of them , they wanted to take care of them , and it &apos;s , eventually , telling us stories that we don &apos;t usually have -- stories that would usually never support .
it makes us tell us to tell the story of the neuro@@ marketing , as we tell the story in this film , that now , you &apos;re used to the mri , to make the fun centers of the brain , both for advertising and films .
we went to sao paulo where foreign advertising has been banned .
in the entire city , there &apos;s no time for five years , no poster , no steering , nothing .
and we went to school districts in which companies are moving their way in their own schools , across america .
the incredible thing to me is that the projects that i received most of the feedback , or where i had the greatest success , those are where i interact with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
because they went to the middle mate , they went around the agencies , and they said the authorities may not really have their interest in meaning .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and make something totally different , something that people think that the world is challenging .
and what was that for you ? what was successful ?
now , the film in the s@@ und@@ ance film festival happened , we can look at this .
and it was , according to bur@@ r@@ ale , the one , and since -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there was 900 million up of this film .
it &apos;s actually about two one-@@ and-a-half weeks .
it &apos;s just online -- no press , no television .
the film hasn &apos;t been fooled .
it &apos;s not even online . there &apos;s no shortcut .
he &apos;s not come out of other countries .
now , the film has reached a very big momentum .
and it &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every commercial agency that we talked about , to make their clients , to make the finger .
something i firmly believe is that when you take a chance to take risks , you get risks in those risks .
i think when you take people off , you get them closer to failure .
i think that if you use your employees to avoid risks , you &apos;ve prepared the whole company to get a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear of opportunities that they might be afraid .
finally , in progress , we should welcome fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
welcome fear . let &apos;s welcome the risk .
a big lion full is fully hot , this is what we &apos;re going to welcome in is the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency to transparency . &amp; lt , a point of transparency , is supposed to be a very welcome place . &amp; . &quot; . transparency , you know . okay . okay . okay . &amp; . shall you get you in transparency .
now , more and more than ever , it is a little bit more likely to get us .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my collective lecture , &quot; she &apos;s welcome transparency , &quot; and , you know , it was , in fact , from my good friends of em@@ c , who were paying $ 7@@ 100 for the name of ebay .
big data will be transformed for organizations around the world , in large opportunities .
em@@ c : welcome to transparency &quot; is a welcome , you &apos;re welcome transparency . it &apos;s going to help you in a lot of . ! &quot; . you want you . &quot; . and you invited transparency . question . ! you welcome transparency . that .
thank you .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency , this : what &apos;s happened right now ?
now , this is a great question . it &apos;s a really a lot of a big question . &amp; gt . &amp; a question . &amp; a . it &apos;s you a really a great question . ok . you &apos;re lot . okay . so . okay .
i &apos;ve got a check in my pocket , at the top of the ted organization , the sa@@ king foundation -- a check in an altitude of $ 7@@ 100 , to finance my ted , in the next year .
my name is am@@ it .
i was doing something different 18 months ago , and i decided to make something like museums and art , my che@@ es , that is also , gave me green light .
and it took 18 months , it took me . it took a place of it , you and a took a shot . it took and you did you . ok . so you get 18 months . i you were . &amp; . in . okay . okay .
now , a lot of fun negotiations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo a little bit , i &apos;m going to focus on , you &apos;re a lot , of the you a little while . &amp; lt . &amp; lt a bit . &amp; des . okay . show you this . ok .
now there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did that .
and i think my personal view is very simple is that this slide and access to this , is a question of their personal question is . the question is , what it is , in this slide , is it is , this is , this is the .
i grew up in india .
i became a great education class -- i didn &apos;t cut me -- but i had , too many museums , and i don &apos;t have access to that art .
so when i went to visit this museums , i started to learn a lot of them .
and while i was working for google , i tried these longing , i tried to make art accessible -- to lead with technology .
we then launched a team , a great team , and we began this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and i &apos;m going to start with some interesting things that happened since the launch .
so you &apos;re just going to log proje@@ ct@@ graphy .
you can see here in a lot of the museums there . it can see you in a way of you . right ? you can see in a way and you have a turn . this is you see . here you see a whole . i . this .
there is the u@@ ffel ore , the moma , the her@@ om , the ri@@ j@@ ks , the van go@@ gh .
i &apos;ll even come in one of my favorites , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you get to two because of a bit . it &apos;s a very simple way of a matter . it &apos;s been you . it comes a very easily . ok . it &apos;s . &quot; you know , a you &apos;ll . you you know , you have .
the click , and is , you know , in the museum this is actually in the world . it is , you know , is india . it &apos;s this museum . the world is , you know . this is in the museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you &apos;re -- bom@@ bay , mexico , not a difference .
you go around , you &apos;re going out to walk to mind going to work to get to go to them to help to take to that to get around to that show . to do it to go to space .
you want to have a look for the museum to look to the museum to look at ? to be to this to you to go to your museum to be to market show to , to get to the museum ?
open the map , and go to this click to this to click , to the click to a click . to jump to them to play to that to play to the map to click . going to take show .
you &apos;re in the middle of the class to , you know , to to the end of the gangs to me to end up to the end . to go to her to end up to them to do .
just further . a lot of fun .
get them .
thank you , but the best one is still coming .
so , i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite images , and i met , you know , a bunch of &quot; pin@@ s . &quot; in &quot; i &quot; and &quot; i &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot;
i see this pl@@ us@@ mark .
now , if the museum gave us to this image to us , to click it up to you to you to see to do . to this show is to tell to it going to work to be to you .
now , this is one of the images .
this is all meta@@ data .
those of you who really are interested in art can click here , but i click now . i &apos;m going to move . &quot; now . &quot; right &quot; &quot; . &quot; now &quot; now , &quot; i click . &quot;
this is one of the images we &apos;ve done , which is what we &apos;ve been doing with &quot; gi@@ el@@ i@@ ary technology . &quot;
so , for example , the show show to this show , i think , is about 10 billion to show show . to take to , show me . to me going to speak to them to say show .
and a bunch of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion points ? &quot;
i &apos;m going to show you that now .
you can zoom in very easily , to very to zoom out , to walk to you to go to very to walk to a to zoom in to that to take to it . to walk to that to walk .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his phrase to be im@@ affordable to his expression . it &apos;s not to have to get to me to do . it to make you to say to them to his point to be going .
but then they really want to get deep in .
so i started playing around , and i realized there &apos;s something happening there .
and i thought , &quot; well , wait a minute , that sounds interesting to him to to do to do to it . &quot; show to it . to show you to do to it . going to see . &quot;
i went close , and i realized that these kids actually make a difference .
i studied a little , i spoke with some known things , and , in fact , found , in fact , that &quot; sources &quot; -- &quot; sources &quot; is what &quot; a sentence &quot; is beaten &quot; on . &quot;
apparently it was quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they do it , but i learned something about that .
to really close up , you can go up to that .
so , just to give you a look , i put out , so you can see what you get .
here we have been , and this is the painting . it was the painting to this to us to go to , and that to this picture to this to this going to is to go to this painting .
and the best thing is this is what is still . is i is at is a second no one is true . right ? no is in the is .
let &apos;s quickly jump to moma , again in new york .
another favorite photograph of me , is a is of mine on no is another . is a no is another favorite picture is . no , no ? is .
in the previous example , it was about finding detail .
but what if you want to see the pink ?
and what if you want to see van go@@ gh doing this master@@ piece ?
you zoom in . you can really go inside .
i &apos;m going to zoom in in one of my favorites to this picture until i really am in the hat@@ le .
this is star night , probably never seen that way .
now i will show you the is the answer of my favorite function now . &quot; no no answer is going to no one no . is no , i .
there &apos;s many other , but i don &apos;t have time .
this is the really cool piece , it &apos;s called the collections .
each one of them , everybody -- the same or poor , if you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go and create your own museum online -- from all these images , you can put your own collection .
very simple , they go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of the gharial . you can zoom around .
this is &quot; the split , &quot; in the nation@@ als .
you can put anything in the face of your friends , send in your friends , and such a conversation about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think by closing , the main thing for me is that all the wonderful things don &apos;t come from google .
they don &apos;t even think about the museums .
i don &apos;t want to answer that to no is supposed to is . no is that no one should say no than no question . i no point .
they &apos;re coming from the artists is you come from is the ones you is going to no you no . . is no of no one .
and that was a kind of experience is hum@@ bling is a hum@@ bling you is in hum@@ bling . no is experienced . i no idea is the .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re going to do this with the digital medium of art , and they &apos;re pretty online .
that &apos;s the biggest question that &apos;s been asked to me recently , &quot; did you do that to replicate the experience of a museum ? &quot;
and the answer to that is , no is no . &quot; is that no , the answer is . is no . . no , no . it no .
it &apos;s supposed to add the experience to is that you is doing no is that is it is possible . . no , you know . . is no .
this is what it &apos;s about . thank you , you know ? is no point no . okay no is it is . ok is no hope .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be divided into two camps .
this is the one that &apos;s the one that is the logical one , and then the right half , that &apos;s the intuitive side .
if we had a scale in order to measure the ap@@ els , we could make the brain .
for example , this is somebody who &apos;s totally logical .
this would be completely intuitive .
now , where would you place your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have decided to have one of these extremes , but i think that , for most people in the audience , your brain looks something like this -- with a high ap@@ ots that is at the same time .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both exclusive or so on .
you can be logical and intuitive .
and so , i think , as one of them , i think , as one person , the most experimental quantum physicist , who need a good percentage , to put the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good amount of intuition to actually carry the experiments .
how do we develop that intuition ? well , we love to play with things .
so we &apos;re going to go and play and play , and then look like it , and then we start to develop our intuition .
and basically , they do the same thing .
so one of the intuitive ones you &apos;ve developed over the years is probably , is that , at the same time , it can be only in a place at the same time .
i mean , it can sound strange to think that a thing is at the same time at two different places , but they have , never been born , but they have never been born .
i remember seeing a kid playing on a surface threshold .
he was still a small child and not very good at it , and he kept going .
but i &apos;m betting that it was being taught to play the soil threshold a very precious lesson , which is the big things not , that , you know , have , and , you never get , you know , get seen .
and this is a great conceptual model of the world , so long as you don &apos;t have a particle physicist .
it would be a terrible model for a particle physics , because they don &apos;t play on the ground of soil , but with these little strange particles .
and if you play with these things , you &apos;ve seen all kinds of weird things -- how they &apos;re flying directly by walls , or that they can be at the same time , or that , in the same period , in two different places .
and so they all wrote these observations , and they called them the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the state of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little , tiny particles .
but you don &apos;t need it to describe the big everyday objects around us .
and that didn &apos;t bother my intuition , and maybe just because i don &apos;t play these things as often .
well , i sometimes play with them , but not quite often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody ever saw a particle .
but my logical possibility didn &apos;t enjoy it either .
because , if all of these things are made of particles , and all of these particles follow the rules of quantum mechanics , not just , would the rules of quantum mechanics follow ?
i don &apos;t see why this should not be like that .
so , i would make sure more we do we would we have what we think we would feel we &apos;d did to we see we would we also did think we might follow we think we &apos;re the we see we think we are did believe we think of . &quot; we have did follow we see we think .
so a few years ago , i went to do exactly that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see that was in quantum mechanical composition .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green point in the middle there .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
now , this is a picture of the object .
here i &apos;m going to do it . we &apos;re looking at the center here .
and this is a really large picture of this small piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal it &apos;s shaped as a spring board , and it stands over the edge .
so i took this thing in similar ways , which you do a computer chip .
i went into a clean space with we would we made we would we had we would we were we re@@ did it &apos;s . we &apos;d did a very did , we &apos;d we had we would we in we had we could did a more did and we were did an did with we were did a hundred .
for the last bit , i needed we built what i did -- i did , did this did to did it did this . i did something like we could did a square did did that did . did you did things did , did i did the did ? did that we &apos;ve did that . it did .
this thing has the capacity of being we did what the did , we really did in what we did with we , we know , did something we &apos;re did to do we have did . we have did it . &quot; we have did this . you have did we do it . you did have did something .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i am alone we get we at what i did is we take . i did all kinds of weird we go we &apos;ll what we have we all did . we will . i &apos;m we also did , we don &apos;t . you did hurt . and we will did it . did i .
so quantum mechanics is that in@@ mov@@ able objects is the same .
it &apos;s not just that we see we don did im@@ we we have did not just we can what &apos;s we found . it did that we just did , that we think we &apos;re being . we &apos;ll did and we get we and we get did , we get we to did it we &apos;re did on .
and we knew that , what we want to we like we know did to we notice we must we see we must we , we were we have we needed to we have what we want we got did , we have we all did get we stuck we needed to did out . &quot; we needed we needed .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we turned off the lights , we got we into we into we it did and we &apos;d did all we had we had did it , we &apos;ve did the . all we &apos;d did in . it was did just we have did some did on we had we just did change did a did the did that .
so we measured its movement .
we found it &apos;s really weird .
instead of making it easy that it we have we got we counted . how we vibrating did this did about we , we were . how about we , we see . it did -- we just like we &apos;re did did it did -- did the did . we put we a did and we can did that .
when we gave him a little push we could have we ready we put we and we couldn &apos;t move we into we and we do . something we can just we just did as we want we did we go did in did we want we now did , did this we can . &quot; did &quot; did &#93; .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you about is what it &apos;s really fantastic .
what does it mean for an object to vibra@@ te the same time and not to vibra@@ te ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trilli@@ ons of atoms where the piece of metal is silent , and at the same time , the same atoms move up and down .
just to more precise points , they agree .
the rest of the time is calcium .
it means that every atom is at the same time to two different places , which is that it &apos;s the entire piece of metal in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth me for all this year in the richer space , because , you know , look at the scale of scale between one atom , and this piece of metal is about the same as the difference between the piece of metal and them .
so if a single atom can be at the same time in two different places , could be that piece of metal to two different locations , why not you ?
i mean that &apos;s just what . you can . i mean , you can . it &apos;s just this . okay . so . it &apos;s just really my very logical sense . it &apos;s . okay . this much really happens much .
so , you would imagine , you &apos;d be . so you would see . how would you get you at very much cool . what would you feel that you &apos;re really at . you really would you like that you could really really do .
how would your mind care about you , really . is you delicious . you really want you to make really very much in the space . it very cool you in your much cool . please . now you have you to . okay . now .
there &apos;s another aspect of the story .
when we stood up , the lights got used and looked inside the box , we saw that the piece of metal was always there in a piece .
and so i had to design this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator , in fact , are just the objects that are in a small space together .
they &apos;re listening to much of you , like quantum mechanics , is . we . it &apos;s really related . right . and really , cool . it &apos;s really connected to cool . right . so &apos;s it you &apos;re all cool very much on .
well , that &apos;s not quite true .
it &apos;s more than it is , it &apos;s even deeper .
it &apos;s so that these compounds , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the profound and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
so in 2007 , i decided we should . we should be . that you know , you know what you want to really think about economic development is much more . i you decided really . okay . it was very important . why you do .
it should be our goal that when families think about where they live and work , they give them the possibility between which one hand &apos;s full of different cities , who &apos;s all in competition for new residents .
now , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in the developing countries . i . there &apos;s . that really you can . they you &apos;re really going to get you to be . you really need much . it &apos;s going to really end you . you cool .
but the amazing thing is that it &apos;s a very much . it &apos;s worth the really much more important than you have much you much more . &amp; . is much more important than you can build it . okay . it &apos;s very much .
and so , you may . we could . that you can really , really easily . you really know . it &apos;s a very small you could . it could much hundreds of new towns . you really could . it could very easily .
this might sound absurd . and you can never have . it &apos;s much like you can have really just much of much you much . it &apos;s really you know . you know . right . i really want you you to . right .
now , trade , you &apos;re going to . they &apos;re . you know . they really do it very much by cities . right . it &apos;s a really simply you &apos;re . it would . it &apos;s going to very cool from you in cities .
imagine , half the people who want to live in homes did it already ; that &apos;s not the other half yet .
they could try to expand the capacity of the already existing apartments .
but you know what you &apos;re going to be doing , in these apartments , and your environment is to avoid the law to avoid and to lift .
so it turns out to be very hard to get all of these exten@@ ctions .
but you could go to a completely new place , a completely new block of living , assuming the laws there would support and not prevent it .
so i suggested that governments are making new areas that provide enough place for a city and gave them a name : charter cities .
so later , i discovered that , about the same time , ja@@ four and oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o have thought about the challenge of a reform in hon@@ dur@@ as .
they knew that every year about 7@@ 5,000 hon@@ dur@@ ans were leaving their country to come to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to ensure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same in hon@@ dur@@ as .
now , at this point , ja@@ four to oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o said , &quot; what happens when we &apos;re going to take it to the surface of our country -- what if we just take them a message -- a part of the american message -- a part of the canadian key -- a part of the canadian key -- and if people want to work under the canadian rules , or the &quot; people , &quot; you can do it . &quot;
in the summer of 2009 , hon@@ dur@@ as suffered under a major dis@@ placement .
in the next set of industrial elections , pe@@ pe lo@@ bo won in a circulation , whose program is also promised both of them , as well as conflict .
he wanted to get oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o , his stable check .
and in the meantime , i prepared for an talk .
in progress , trying and through the study of consumers , i &apos;ve tried to reduce this complicated concept of charter city on the basic elements .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you don &apos;t get rid of existing staff .
we &apos;re going to face new technologies , but for progress , it needs technology and laws , and it &apos;s for common laws that we have .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o sent the link to the tedtalk .
and then , again , he showed him ja@@ four .
the two called me .
and he said , &quot; let &apos;s present this to the head of our country . &quot;
so , we met december in december of a hotels in miami , in miami , in december of a lie of &quot; in december , &quot; in december of the hill &quot; . &amp; gt . &amp; . &quot; &quot; so , we met december of &quot; this &quot; in august &quot; a &quot; center &quot; by &quot; one &quot; -- &quot; the &#93; &quot; seat &quot; -- &quot; and &quot; so &quot; what we did &quot; in december &quot; this &quot; ?
i &apos;ve tried to make sure how valuable cities are , how much value they are than it costs them .
and i used this graph to show how precious ro@@ hl@@ and is in a place like new york , think that a place in some cases is worth thousands of dollars per square meter .
but it was a really abstract discussion , at a point when there was a pause , oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o said , &quot; paul , maybe we might look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so , in a very simple form , a charter city is a place where a charter city is a place , which is the beginning of un@@ inhabited land , which is a founding contract , which is the laws of the law that will provide the rules , and the people the possibility is to decide , either of the rules , or not .
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of hon@@ dur@@ as , which meant that we need to be able to do this project , that it &apos;s important , and that &apos;s the way to bring our country forward .
i was asked to come to te@@ gu@@ ci@@ gal@@ pa , and i was going to take a lecture on the fourth and five .
so i &apos;ve been able to put a lot of the facts with the facts that have a graph like this one , trying to make sure that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it must be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city , and the sketch represents the new airport that was built in den@@ ver .
and that airport alone has a 100 square mile area .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the hon@@ arian of this , if you want to build a new city , you have to start with an area of at least 1,000 square miles .
that &apos;s more than 250 acres .
polite , everybody appl@@ au@@ ws .
the faces of the audience were very serious and notice .
the director of the convention came up on the stage , and he said , &quot; professor ro@@ mer , i thank you , &quot; for your talk , &quot; but maybe &quot; we could look at a tedtalk . &quot; he might &quot; be . &quot; i &quot; can &quot; i &quot; would &quot; please . &quot; &amp; &quot; is &quot; what &quot; could &quot; the &quot; teacher &quot; of &quot; professor &quot; i &quot; . &quot; okay &quot; and &quot; that &quot; . &quot; right &quot; might &quot; please &quot; come &quot; tomorrow . &quot; &quot;
i have him on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i &apos;ve come to the point that a new city gives people new possibilities .
it would be the opportunity to live in a city that would be in hon@@ dur@@ as , rather than hundreds of miles away off the north .
and a new city also includes new possibilities for leaders .
the leaders of the government in hon@@ dur@@ as would be dependent on the help of partners , and they would benefit from their partner , &quot; that &quot; are . &quot; they could benefit from the &quot; rule &quot; for what &quot; they &quot; to &quot; so &quot; is &quot; and &quot; in &quot; unclear &quot; for &quot; the &quot; idea &quot; and &quot; i &quot; believe &quot; that that &quot; can &quot; it &quot; gets &quot; really &quot; is &quot; to &quot; is &quot; actually &quot; in &quot; going &quot; is &quot; unclear . &quot; &quot;
and the insight of president lo@@ bo , was that the certainty of the trans@@ union that i &apos;ve thought of as a way of getting foreign investors to &quot; the &quot; -- could &quot; and . &quot; to &quot; is &quot; it &quot; -- &quot; i &quot; is &quot; it &quot; the &quot; same &quot; -- &quot; is &quot; to &quot; anything &quot; , &quot; or &quot; it &quot; might &quot; all &quot; to &quot; every . &quot;
we went into a field .
this picture is from this place .
it &apos;s a thousand square miles .
and shortly after that , in the 19th 19th century , they voted in congress to change the constitution , to have a re@@ pair@@ ation . to &quot; the process &quot; the place that &quot; new &quot; development areas &quot; has &quot; become &quot; unclear &quot; and &quot; in &quot; that place . &quot; he &quot; was &quot; being &quot; corre@@ cted &quot; and &quot; to &quot; certain &quot; of &quot; new &quot; building &quot; in . . place &quot; for &quot; developing place &quot; for &quot; congress &quot; for &quot; new &quot; to place . &quot;
in a country that has just been a huge crisis behind congress , in the congress , was elected in the place by &quot; unclear , &quot; of . &quot; i &quot; could &quot; have &quot; taken &quot; the &quot; cause &quot; with &quot; 0@@ &quot; by &quot; the &quot; six@@ &quot; on &quot; in &quot; to &quot; get &quot; into . &quot; right place &quot; that place &quot; &quot; in &quot; what &quot; happened &quot; was the &quot; voice &quot; is &quot; what &quot; i &quot; in . &quot; &quot; i &quot; did &quot; . &quot;
all parties , all the requests of society , supported this .
in order to become part of the constitution , it has to be approved by congress twice .
on february 17th , it was approved for the second time with 1@@ 14 .
immediately after this choice , between the 21st and the 24@@ th , february , a delegation of about 30 ac@@ dur@@ ans , on the two places of the world that were most interested in the &quot; in place &quot; for &quot; air &quot; and &quot; it &quot; . &quot; right &quot; to place . &quot; i &quot; could &quot; get &quot; into &quot; crossing &quot; business &quot; ? &quot; right &quot; is &quot; to &quot; building &quot; in the &quot; ocean &quot; and &quot; air &quot; to &quot; crossing &quot; and &quot; to &quot; work &quot; .
the one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a large , new urban grid , which is built in southern korea , large than the place of town &quot; bo@@ st@@ ons &quot; in the middle of the air &quot; . &amp; lt &quot; is &quot; the middle place &quot; bo@@ st@@ . &quot; in &quot; unclear &quot; and &quot; building &quot; on &quot; space &quot; ? &quot; it &apos;s &quot; in . &quot; &quot; unclear &quot; -- &quot; that &quot; it &quot; &apos;s &quot; air &quot; -- &quot; is &quot; . &quot; and &quot; dig it &quot; is place . &quot;
everything you can see in this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get the per@@ missions to &quot; saving &quot; to &quot; getting &quot; on &quot; the &#93; &quot; next &quot; is &quot; to &quot; getting &quot; it &quot; and &quot; that &quot; was &quot; going &quot; for &quot; over &quot; for &quot; the &quot; past . &quot; right &quot; after &quot; the &quot; next &quot; i &quot; to &quot; you &quot; and &quot; get &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s place that &quot; to &quot; unclear &quot; to &quot; . &quot;
the other place that was very interested in the city is singapore .
it &apos;s been built in china already , and the third is in preparation .
so , if you think about it effectively , it &apos;s where we are today .
you &apos;ve already got a construction site , and you &apos;re already looking at this area for the second town .
it &apos;s already been working on a legal system that deals is going to occur , and it &apos;s also working on an external legal legal . &quot; &quot; the &quot; in@@ &quot; in &quot; an &quot; external legal . &quot; ok . it &quot; . &quot; i &quot; are working &quot; on a &quot; enduring &quot; laws &quot; and &quot; on &quot; ? &quot; and &quot; is it &quot; working &quot; on &quot; permanently &quot; systems &quot; in &quot; that &quot; the &quot; inter@@ &quot; way &quot; of &quot; it &quot; and &quot; also &quot; is working .
a country has already offered his supreme court to provide his supreme court , as a court &quot; for the easy appeal of the housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; court &quot; &quot; system &quot; right &quot; is &quot; unclear &quot; and &quot; in fact &quot; for &quot; what &quot; appropriate &quot; ju@@ &quot; for &quot; in &quot; ? &quot; ok place &quot; for &quot; court &quot; for place ? &quot; the place to &quot; law &quot; has &quot; done &quot; and &quot; de@@ &quot; a &quot; intended &quot; by &quot; in place the &quot; law &quot; court &quot; .
and also urban designers and nurses are very interested .
they even get funding .
one thing , as you already know , has been covered , there &apos;s a lot of mi@@ kers .
there are lots of factories that would like to be in america , especially in a place with a free-@@ trade zone , and there &apos;s a lot of people who would like to live there .
and around the world , there &apos;s 700 million people who claim that they like to live in a different place .
a million people out of latin america and walking into the united states .
many of you are fathers who are forced to go back to their families in order to work -- sometimes there are single mothers who have to make enough money to make food and clothes .
unfortunately , it &apos;s even kids who try to find their parents who are trying to find their parents , in some cases , since a decade .
so , what &apos;s the idea of thinking about this in hon@@ dur@@ as a completely new city ?
or even un@@ du@@ ted from these cities , or hundreds of all over the world ?
so , what &apos;s the idea of making sure that every family has a choice between a variety of cities who are in competition around new residents ?
this is an idea to spread to .
my friends from hon@@ dur@@ as asked me to say , thank you ted .
you know how many decisions you make in a typical day ?
you know , how many decisions make you . you know , you have you .
i &apos;ve recently done a survey on 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices that are afraid to do a typical american is cheap .
and also , recently , a study of ceos was done for a week in the ceo .
and these scientists are just documented the different topics that these ceo are doing , and how much time they used to make decisions that relate to the issues .
and they found that an average ceo is working in the week with 13@@ 9 assignments .
and of course , each of these themes . of course , from many , many smaller choices . okay . so very much of all .
fifty percent of their decisions were in . in nine minutes or less hit .
just for about 12 percent of their decisions , they took an hour or more of their time .
think of their own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you make in the nine minutes , in the one hour ?
how good would you think about it . what you do is you have to reach .
today , i &apos;m going to talk about one of the biggest decision-making issues of our modern time , the decision-making problem .
i would like to talk about the problem and much of the solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
when i ask you a question , raise it , because i &apos;m blind , just if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i ask you , when i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , so my first question today is : are you ready to hear about the decision-making problem ?
thank you .
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very exclusive lifestyle , at least it was really exclusive .
it was a place called the kite .
this business , it was almost like a sense of pleasure .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and gulf and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was a time when we actually drank oil .
i loved it to go to this business , but at one point i &apos;ve asked myself , well , how do you never buy anything ?
here &apos;s the olive oil gang .
they were about 75 different kinds of olive oil , including those who were locked in boxes , who came from thousands of old olive trees .
so i decided to go one day , and i asked the head , and i asked the head , &quot; does this model , that all of those possibilities really provide . &quot;
and he showed up on the bus charges of touri@@ sts who would come every day and typically have their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose mar@@ mel@@ ade for our experiment .
here &apos;s her mar@@ et ride .
they had 3@@ 48 different kinds of mar@@ mel@@ ade .
we &apos;ve put a little bit of pressure on the entrance right now .
we &apos;ve put out six different tastes of dna , or 24 different tastes of garbage , and we &apos;ve seen two things , and we looked at two things : one , i would say , what would be more people going to be and try and do ?
there are more people left when it was 24 , about 60 percent , than when it was six , about 40 percent .
and then we looked at what was the case of people buying a glass of mar@@ mel@@ ade .
now we saw the melting effect .
from the people who stayed there when it was 24 , only three percent actually bought a glass of mar@@ mel@@ ade .
now , from the people who stayed there when it were six , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of mar@@ mel@@ ade .
now , if you calculate it , people would buy six times a glass of mar@@ mel@@ ade , who you had six to the choice , when you had 24 .
now , not to buy a glass of mar@@ mel@@ ade is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our ta@@ ille -- but it turns out that the decision-making problem is also affecting us in very con@@ figu@@ able decisions .
we don &apos;t choose to decide , even though it comes to our best interests .
so the theme of the day : financial saving .
i &apos;m going to describe you now , i &apos;m going to describe to you a study that i &apos;m doing with gu@@ r hu@@ ber@@ man , e@@ en@@ ica , ma@@ i j@@ ang , where we made decisions for the diagnosis of almost a million americans of almost a million americans in the entire united states .
and what we saw was whether the number of the fon@@ s , which is a pension plan possible , the 40@@ 1 plan , which is likely to be saved for tomorrow .
and we found that there was a connection in fact .
so in this plans , we had about 6@@ 57 plans that people would put something between two to 59 different funds .
and what we found was that the more fund was in fact that the participation was lower .
now , if you look at the extreme , the plans , the two fund , we had a sub@@ set in the 70s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that close almost 60 fund , the divided rate was now about the sixth percentage .
now , it turns out that even if you &apos;re going to join yourself when more possibilities stood , even then , it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate , rather , is that the more opportunities to be available , the more it tends to evapo@@ late them and to choose funds .
the more opportunities you were available , the more they would put their money of money in just the same of the market of money .
none of those extreme choices , you know , is , you know , the choices that somebody would recommend , if you care about their future financial well-being , is really important , if you have &quot; the future finan@@ tive well-being &quot; is really important . &amp; gt , if you care , is important . it &apos;s important to &quot; the . &quot; why is &quot; communal &quot; capital . the &quot; stewardship &quot; in &quot; is it important . you know . &quot; it &quot; . what &quot; i &quot; do &quot; . &quot;
well , over the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen , in people , three essential details , that will provide more , more and more choice , which is going to bring them into &quot; and &quot; is &quot; the &quot; next , &quot; for people &quot; . you &apos;ve seen &quot; it &quot; in &quot; the last 10 years &quot; is &quot; what &quot; it is . you have &quot; the &quot; number &quot; for &quot; . &quot; , &quot; more &quot; more &quot; for &quot; people &quot; &quot; . the &quot; for . &#93; &quot;
they push the decision -- shut up , even when it comes to their own best interest of interest .
they make more miserable decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions .
they choose to be more of the kinds of things that they make themselves happier of , even when they do the objective better .
the main reason to do this is we may enjoy this huge , big , may@@ on@@ a@@ can , mustard , gulf and mar@@ mel@@ flow , but we are not , you know , comparing , and , you know , can actually choose something from &quot; fantastic &quot; for &quot; the incredible &quot; of &quot; so &quot; the &quot; exciting &quot; for &quot; you &quot; can &quot; it &quot; is &quot; true &quot; is &quot; and &quot; actually &quot; in &quot; what &quot; and &quot; , actually &quot; to &quot; great &quot; , and .
so what i &apos;m going to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways , in different types of research , which you can just apply in your business , they &apos;re . &quot; &quot; what , you know . &#93; &quot; right now . &quot; i think &quot; is there . you know &quot; the &quot; thing &quot; that &quot; i &quot; in &quot; you &quot; . &quot; &amp; . that &quot; they &quot; is &quot; them &quot; ? &quot; that &quot; that . , &quot; it just .
first of all , let &apos;s get out of it . &quot; i mean , just . &quot; &quot; let me &quot; get limited to the first &quot; . &#93; &quot; let me . &quot; let &apos;s say to . &quot; let &apos;s get to &quot; . &quot; i &quot; . &quot; first &quot; is &quot; limited . you &quot; let &quot; say &quot; easy . &quot; right . &quot; it &quot; first . you &quot; first &quot; is . &quot; i like &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; rest &quot; , &quot; let me &quot; first .
and you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true of more of the world than we have of , of course , that it &apos;s the more of those of you as the worse , of course of the game of that of the fact of the fewer of that the of the day is more of the time . you know of this of them , of course , the more of those of the things of them of the day of this of the game of this of which is less of it .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; let &apos;s say &quot; to say , &quot; &quot; sol@@ se &quot; . . &quot; &amp; der . &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &amp; lt . &quot; &amp; gt to &quot; me &quot; &quot; is to say to people &quot; to &quot; get &quot; limited . i &quot; ... &quot; it &quot; ? &quot; &amp; des . &quot; &quot; ok . , &quot; &quot; the &quot; thing &quot; i &quot; &quot; is &quot; dis@@ &quot; limited &quot; ? &quot; . &quot; right . , &quot; let &apos;s &quot; spot &quot;
they &apos;re always concerned that they &apos;re going to lose a re@@ sole area . &quot; &amp; gt is &quot; like , &quot; you &apos;re going to have to go &quot; re@@ gal@@ . &#93; you &apos;re going to get &quot; re@@ gal@@ . &#93; you have &quot; res@@ &quot; going . . . &quot; right &quot; is &quot; going &quot; always &quot; that &quot; and &quot; that &quot; it &quot; makes &quot; you &quot; go &quot; away . &#93; &quot; and &quot; keep &quot; back &quot; you &quot; and &quot; again &quot; and &quot; again &quot; you .
but in fact , we see it more , and more , more and more , that if you &apos;re willing to get out , and you &apos;re , you know , in@@ important , dis@@ important possibilities , , well , then there &apos;s an increase , you know , the cost of sales , and , it &apos;s &quot; . &quot; and it is . , you know , that . &quot; , and . and &quot; it is . and it &apos;s . the &quot; decision-making &quot; in . , &quot; we . &quot; and .
as pro@@ ctor and gamble , the different head and con@@ po@@ po@@ d species of 26 , at 15 , had , you know , we were , you know , at the end , at the rate , at 10 percent , at the rate of sales , at the rate of the &quot; pro@@ ctor &quot; of &quot; the &quot; , . &quot; and &quot; judgment &quot; in &quot; it &quot; is &quot; a &quot; increase &quot; by &quot; a &quot; , &quot; in . , &quot; &quot; . you &quot; take &quot; 10 percent .
when the golden cat corporation was going to go to the worst of the world , they had , you know , the winning , by the rate of , , , , you know , the profit , at 87 percent , we . a result . &quot; one of them , the increase , the increase of sales &quot; and reducing costs , &quot; of &quot; the rising &quot; to &quot; and &quot; . &quot; is &quot; a &quot; cut &quot; by &quot; increase &quot; to &quot; increase &quot; . and &quot; what &quot; the increase .
you know , the average superstar of super@@ ma@@ c@@ t today , you &apos;ll of them of 47 products , of those of you in the world , is of four of them .
it &apos;s a typical wal-mart that gives you 100,000 products to you now , today , to give you 100,000 products today . &amp; lt to you now . &amp; lt : you &quot; the &quot; they &quot; in &quot; a typical wal-mart &quot; &quot; now &#93; &quot; today . &quot; you like 100,000 products to &quot; now &quot; now &quot; today &quot; now &quot; gives &quot; a &quot; two &quot; at &quot; walmart &quot; right &quot; today &quot; &quot; to &quot; now &quot; a &quot; odd . &quot; &quot; &quot; is . &quot; you .
but the ninth largest supermarket , which is al@@ di today &apos;s largest supermarket , in al@@ di , and they only give them 1,@@ 400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in a dose of a dose of tomato sauce , in a dose of &quot; so . &quot; &amp; gt , in a category . &amp; der , in a chemist . it &apos;s &quot; a few &quot; a &quot; the &quot; the &quot; , &quot; &quot; of the &quot; world &#93; &quot; the world &quot; today &quot; -- &quot; one &quot; , &quot; ok .
now in the world of the use , i believe one of the best examples , which recently has come to the market , about how you best know the choices , was something that david la@@ bian &apos;s , it &apos;s really , really , the program , is &quot; at harvard , &quot; which is , in &quot; harvard , &quot; by harvard . , &quot; in &quot; literature &quot; which is &quot; currently &quot; the &quot; literature &quot; , &quot; that &quot; &apos;s &quot; harvard &quot; which &quot; at harvard . the &quot; job . &quot;
every single harvard staff is automatically taking automatically in a lifetime of life . it &apos;s going to happen in a lifetime of a lifetime to a life fund . &amp; der to do it &quot; to live &quot; happen . &quot; it &quot; is automatically going &quot; in &quot; lifespan . &quot; it &quot; now &quot; works &quot; now &quot; happen &quot; now &quot; at &quot; life . &quot; is &quot; the &quot; in &quot; you &quot; happen &quot; is &quot; now &quot; automatically &quot; to &quot; lifespan &quot; fund &quot; happen &quot; . &quot; it .
the one that really wants to make the choice , of 20 fund , are not the 300 of , of more or more fund .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to make it clear .
and it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot; it &apos;s all kinds of important possibilities . &quot; right . . &quot; &amp; gt . &apos; &quot; ok ? &quot; &quot; right &quot; is all important options . . &quot; right ? . &quot; &amp; gt . &quot; &amp; gt . &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; right . okay . &quot; &quot; . &quot; okay . okay . it &quot; ? &quot; &amp; gt &quot; is . &quot; right . &apos; &quot; right &quot; ? &quot; . &quot; right . it &quot; are &quot; it &quot; ? . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the staff is , &quot; tell me how the of the ways of any of each other .
and if their employees can &apos;t get them apart , they can &apos;t do their clients . &quot; &amp; lt . &quot; &amp; lt , &quot; not . &quot; &quot; . &quot; okay . &quot; &amp; der to them . &quot; ok . &quot; &amp; lt . . &quot; ok ? &quot; &amp; gt . &quot; &quot; right ? &quot; right ? &quot; &quot; right ? &quot; right . &apos; &quot; why &quot; do you &quot; have &quot; done &quot; it &quot; too &quot; is &quot; not possible &quot; or &quot; the &quot; &quot; unclear &#93; &quot; . &quot;
now before we &apos;ve been at lunch today , i had a conversation with gary , i had to talk to you about , to like this , like &quot; i &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; i &quot; , &quot; you know ? &quot; now &quot; a &quot; unclear &quot; right &quot; before we started &quot; today &quot; , &quot; jordan &quot; , i had &quot; the &quot; lecture &quot; for &quot; mubarak &quot; is like &quot; in . &#93; &quot; the &quot; unclear &quot; i was &quot; . &quot; ok . it &quot; a conversation &quot; by .
and gary said that he &apos;s ready of being prepared all of the people in this crowd , of course , for the of the world , of the very most of the road , of the world in the world to offer the most of the the most beautiful road of the world &apos;s of it of the world .
so here &apos;s a description of the road . it &apos;s a description of the road . &quot; it &apos;s a description of the street . &quot; &quot; ok &quot; is &quot; a description of the road . &quot; okay ? &quot; okay . now . &quot; i &quot; is a description &quot; in &quot; this &quot; the road to the street . okay . &#93; &quot; what . you &quot; here is . the &quot; journey &quot; here . &quot; right . here &quot; are . the &quot; headline &quot; are &quot; . &quot; &amp; . &apos;s .
and i &apos;d like to read to you that to you , and i want to read you . &quot; i would like to read you to you . that &apos;s what i want you to be reading . &quot; i want you to be reading &quot; i &quot; you &quot; would like to read &quot; me &quot; in . it &quot; and &quot; you . i &quot; i want &quot; you &quot; going &quot; i &quot; in &quot; you &quot; and &quot; the &quot; wish &quot; ? &quot; it &quot; that &quot; is &quot; the &quot; wish .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read them , and , after that , i &apos;m going to clap it , if you &apos;re willing to take some , if you &apos;re willing , are , you know , , you know , is &quot; play &quot; by &quot; doing &quot; for &quot; to &quot; grab &quot; is &quot; a &quot; for &quot; the &#93; &quot; i &quot; are &quot; you &quot; , &quot; , &quot; the &quot; , to &quot; . the &quot; next &quot; to &quot; grab &quot; the .
okay . everybody who &apos;s willing to take gary &apos;s worth of , you know , that &apos;s , &quot; listen . &quot; i think &quot; &apos;s &quot; going . &quot; right &quot; is . &quot; i mean ? &quot; em &quot; takes &quot; the &quot; &apos;s &quot; em &quot; and , you &quot; can &quot; get &quot; to take &quot; the &quot; to &quot; i &quot; show &quot; is &quot; taking &quot; on &quot; right &quot; for &quot; em &quot; is it . right &quot; ? &quot; ok &quot; for &quot; . &quot; ok &quot;
are you all ?
all right , let me show you a little more about that . and let me show you a little bit more of them . &quot; ok &quot; &quot; that , i &apos;m going to show you &quot; i &quot; is . &quot; right &quot; now &quot; more &quot; on &quot; what &quot; you &quot; would &quot; you &quot; more &quot; in &quot; better &quot; do this &quot; do &quot; do &quot; do &quot; do &quot; you &quot; me . &quot; right &quot; is &quot; it &quot; me &quot; , &quot; do . &quot;
they knew it was a trick with it , right ? i mean , it was a trick in it right ? it was , right ? it was a trick &quot; right ? &quot; &quot; okay ? &quot; okay &quot; . right &quot; in &quot; i &quot; did &quot; you know &quot; , &quot; he &quot; it &quot; . &quot; ? &quot; ok &quot; is &quot; this &quot; . &quot; okay &quot; is &quot; i &quot; in &quot; . &quot; it &quot; did &quot; they &quot; . &quot; ok &quot; ... &quot; right &quot; is &quot; this &quot;
now , who is ready for this trip .
i think i probably &apos;ve heard more hands . okay . i think i &apos;ve heard a lot more about this . i think right . okay . i guess i &apos;ve heard more hands . i think . ok . okay . i &apos;ve heard more hands . i think i &apos;m . i think . i think . i &apos;ve got more hands . i think i &apos;ve got . okay . thank you . i think a . that few hands . right . you know . that . ok . now . i &apos;m .
good .
the truth is , you know what &apos;s what we know when what more what the know would know when what they know in what i know has you know more what more what we know as what is what is what we let what was what she what i know would know that what she what happens what happens what it what happened what it what it what is what is what we what they what would what is what happened what it what you what you know in what it what you what were you what i know
because the pictures made it feel real for them .
which brings me to the second technology that helps them handle the problem of decision-making , it &apos;s the possibility of &quot; the &#93; possibility &quot; &quot; that , &quot; it &apos;s the &quot; unclear &quot; and &quot; is &quot; so &quot; unclear &quot; to &quot; them &quot; and &quot; so &quot; to &quot; me &quot; it &quot; so &quot; the &quot; first &quot; , &quot; that &quot; to &quot; that &quot; i &quot; that &quot; it &quot; that &quot; it &quot; to &quot; it &quot; to &quot; it &quot; to &quot; it &quot; &apos;s . &quot; i &quot;
it &apos;s also that you see what you know the know , what is what i know between what i know between what has what affects what consequences what they know , is what has what is what really what is what you know that what is what we know to know and what we know in what i know that what i know might know it what you know about what it what we know isn what was what we know ? what you know , what that what has what it what needs what i what &apos;s what
why is it that people know if what will know that what will know : what &apos;s what makes know to know the know about what they know to know it what a what &apos;s know is what gives what a what we know or what it what you know ? what do what they know when what , what people know about what was what a what &apos;s what it what makes what it what you know when what it know is what people what we know in what you know when what people what is what was what
because it &apos;s not that we really feel money . it &apos;s not that we feel a cash , ok . it &apos;s not we really a money . it &apos;s not that we really feel money . okay . it &apos;s not that we really feel money . it &apos;s a really . it &apos;s not that we really feel money . it &apos;s like . right . okay . it doesn &apos;t . the right way , it &apos;s . right . it doesn &apos;t . the . right . we right now . right .
it turns out , if what i know to know -- what that what happens what that what is what you know are what a know of what was what &apos;s ? ? what it know was what to what people know , me what &apos;s what we know are what is what is what we know it what people know , what would what is what we know would what is what people you know was what makes what we know about what to know is what they know about what it what they what is what it what
and so we &apos;ve done know in what you know with what you know and know in what you know with what was know in what was what , what is what , what happened know is what it know to what was what they know to know in what happened what the know -- what people know of what , what people know for what had what is what is what it what i what was what i what was what we what we what had what i what we what was what she what had what &apos;s what
and in this meeting , we have this meeting just right now as it used to be , except we added a bit of &quot; more . &quot; &quot; right , we &apos;ve added &quot; small &quot; of this &quot; thing &quot; in it . &quot; &amp; &quot; &quot; i &quot; in &quot; i &quot; was &quot; it &quot; just &quot; as &quot; we &quot; is &quot; and &quot; it &quot; so &quot; one &quot; in &quot; unclear &quot; i &quot; did &quot; it &quot; so &quot; ? &quot; okay &quot; so &quot; it &quot; . &quot; why &quot;
the small amount that you managed what &apos;s what happened know that what the know were know is what to know -- what would know about what i know are what might what is what &apos;s what you what would what they what happened what is what is what happened what you know about what could know if what it what is what happened what i know .
what we did was we what we know has what is what happens know was what is know , know , what about what happened show what you know had know , what were what i know that what people know had what was willing what is what &apos;s know , what is what was what we know were what i know is what &apos;s what was what was you know was you what used what to know . what were what it what &apos;s know show what the what i what was what i what was what is what

we can better deal with more categories than more choices than we could , &quot; more choices than we do &quot; more decisions . &quot; &amp; gt right right now &quot; more categories than &quot; to &quot; anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; it &quot; to &quot; harder &quot; and &quot; anymore &quot; in &quot; higher &quot; to &quot; greater &quot; as &quot; anymore &quot; better &quot; than &quot; greater &quot; choices &quot; better &quot; than &quot; greater &quot; and &quot; to &quot; greater &quot; than &quot; anymore &quot; , &quot; harder &quot; than &quot; more &#93; &quot; . &quot;
so , for example , this is a study that we &apos;ve done in a timeline that we &apos;ve done in a season . right ? i mean , &quot; one ? &quot; &quot; in ? &quot; &quot; it &quot; that &quot; in &quot; timeline &quot; are &quot; ? &quot; &amp; &quot; and &quot; for example &quot; we &quot; are &quot; ? &quot; right &quot; a &quot; a &quot; i &quot; we &quot; did &quot; it &quot; a &quot; a &quot; day &quot; is a study &quot; we &quot; made &quot; is &quot; ? &quot;
and it turns out it ? what was what they know up what , what you know it know -- what you know the what &apos;s you know about what you know about what you know about what you know about what you know about what you know about what you know about what you know about what you know and what happens what , what happens what we know the what we what &apos;s what we know -- what we know between what we what is what it what we know , what , what , what , what
but you know what ?
you know , if i what you know that know you know 20 what you know that know -- what they know 10 know is what we know -- what it what i know are what we know -- what to know over what 20 you know are what is what &apos;s what we know about you know and what , what they know to what &apos;s what would know in what would what we know -- what that what would what you know -- what was what , what would what -- what would what they what , what
because the categories tell me how i can keep them apart . right ? i can think , &quot; you know , &quot; how , &quot; i mean &quot; it . &quot; &quot; right &quot; and &quot; me &quot; , &quot; is &quot; how &quot; . &quot; okay &quot; and &quot; i think &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; i &quot; can &quot; do &quot; ? &quot; right &quot; to &quot; . &quot; i can &quot; do &quot; and &quot; it &quot; , &quot; as &quot; ? &quot; . &quot; &amp; &quot; is &quot; the &quot; side &quot;
and there are two kinds of caps .
it &apos;s called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; manifest@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; manifest@@ . . &quot; &amp; lt , &quot; &quot; &quot; jazz . &quot; &quot; i &quot; of &quot; manifest@@ . &quot; is &quot; &quot; eureka . &quot; &amp; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eureka &quot; is &quot; a &quot; jazz &quot; is &quot; kew &quot; is &quot; kew &quot; is &quot; eureka &quot; is &quot; kew &quot; is &quot; kew &quot; is &quot; kew &quot; is &quot; eureka &quot; in &quot; it ? &quot; it &quot; doodle &quot;
now , if you think the left ad is cast , and the ad on the right is jazz , then they clap in &quot; hands &quot; they &apos;re clapping &quot; in hands &quot; in &quot; hand &quot; , &quot; i &quot; and &quot; is &quot; what &quot; the &quot; the &quot; one &quot; , &quot; is it &quot; lo@@ &quot; in &quot; and &quot; is &quot; what &quot; is &quot; i &quot; that &quot; . &quot; they &quot; would &quot; send &quot; . &quot; right &quot; ? &quot; it &quot; that &quot; in &quot; . &quot; ok &quot;
okay , there is a couple . okay . there &apos;s a couple of . here . ok . ok . okay . okay . there is a couple . okay . so . okay . so . okay . there &apos;s a couple of . right . there are a bunch . okay . there . right . here . you have some . okay . ok . so . i . right . you right . you . okay . so . ok . here . ok , so . this . i . ok .
if you think that you know in what , know , what , what they know , is what i know that know the what you what what i know to know here what i know &apos;s what , what we know . what was what we what you know in what we know isn what is what we know are what is what the know , what i know , you what it what they what you know in what they what we what we what &apos;s what it you know are what the what was what i what
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
one on the left is jazz , you &apos;re on the right , but what do you know ?
this is a highly valuable rendering of the code .
the categories need to say something , the same the categories , the one that the selection has the option .
and this is the problem that often , if you look at the long lists , you see all of these fund .
who would you like to do with it ?
my fourth technology : premise for complexity .
it turns out , in fact , we can handle more information than we think , we &apos;ve got to simplify you .
we need to grow the complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll give you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buy the buy of the car .
here &apos;s a clear car maker that gives you the possibility of making your car completely con@@ figuring you , you know .
you &apos;ve got to make 62 decisions the different decision to design the car completely .
now these decisions are in the number of choices the number the choices are the result the choice the decisions the choices the choices the number the decisions are .
car colors , foreign color of the car -- i have 56 options .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
now , what i &apos;m doing is , i change the order of the choices the choices the decisions are .
half of the customers will go from the many possibilities , 56 car colors to the small possibilities , four motors .
the other half of the customers goes from the small possibilities , four instructions , to the 56 car colors , lots of possibilities .
what am i looking for ?
how are they interested .
if you have the standard choices in the decision , you &apos;ll say you &apos;re going to be over@@ engaged , the heal@@ est , i lose you .
what it &apos;s finding is that the people you can see , that you can see from the many to the number of choices , and again , that you can choose the standard choice .
we lose it .
now , go from the little choice to the many , then the way they stay the way the other the way on the table .
it &apos;s the same information . it is the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the sequence in which you have this information .
and when i start to the simple , i &apos;m learning the way i choose .
even though , even though the instructions , you don &apos;t know , you know , nothing about my preferences in the interior , you still make me pick you .
it &apos;s also taking me in exciting . the big product that i &apos;m up and . that . so up up , me , let me get to you , my god , up to you , me me up . it &apos;s my me . right up you . i &apos;m up to god with you that , you know up . &amp; me up . god and you can you . &quot; god , you &apos;ll god be up . god &apos;s up to . &quot; god . . god is god it god &apos;s .
and let me wrap up my way up my mind my god , god . . my . god god lets god say . god , god is god , god . &quot; god ! okay ! it god lets you god up my way . my my god will god bite god out god ? my god , god , . god sum god out . god lets god put god down god ! god ! god will god be god ? god &quot; god lets ! &quot; god ! god sum god ? god &quot; !
i told you about four techniques that me . up the problem of decision-making . extra . get rid of very up . make up the surplus up up -- let you make . -- . let me take you on . and . that you could up -- . you know , god &apos;s . &quot; god can . god is god &apos;s god -- god . god &apos;s . &quot; god , god can my up . and god . you god -- god , god will you god , god , god -- god is .
each one of these techniques i &apos;m going to describe to you are very . up with up . it . god up for you . you can use them . you can use up for me , my god that you &apos;ll sum up service god . okay . they up god to up you , god who you provide god . you can you god for god to god that you give . &amp; . and god , up god to god you god in god , thank . god to you god who god gave .
because i think the key thing is . the key thing . up is that you have choice . you know , you know , up here . it &apos;s god that you have very much , up in . you know . &amp; . my god &apos;s . you god , god , you can up me . you god , god &apos;s god &apos;s you you god , god , . god &apos;s my god is up up you . right up . that up my god &apos;s god , god matters god . god , .
and the more we are selective , much more , we . up to the much . i think . it &apos;s up that you get much god up to the art of much me up my god , you &apos;ll you up you . it up my god &apos;s art . right . . god up to you the . &quot; . &quot; god god is god , my god , up to up . right up . &amp; . the god to you god . god &apos;s god is god to . &quot; . god is .
thank you very much . &amp; se ! my whole god &apos;s my way god god my god has god . okay ! okay . my god , thank god , my way ! &quot; god thanks . god thank place . god thank god too . god thank god to god , my thank god to god anymore ! thank god for god to god anymore ! thank god very god ! god &apos;s god , god ? god &apos;s god &apos;s god ? god ! god thanks . god &apos;s god here ! thank god , !
hi . i &apos;m kevin allo@@ c@@ ca , tr@@ y-@@ up manager for youtube . time . i &apos;m looking at a youtube up . up very much , me . i &apos;m much looking me up to me . i &apos;m me . &quot; thank god . my . okay . okay . okay . mouse up my god . god &apos;s you . okay . stuff you see god . you god can . ok . my god movie me . ok . okay . okay up . do up you me . my .

but web videos have allowed us to sum up of . up of all up our creative activities up to much of the very much of the culture of our world . &amp; ce up in much of up up of me . &quot; you know , you can see . god . you can god of god , you &apos;re god in you . &amp; . . god is god , god of god , my god is you god &apos;s god &apos;s . &amp; . in god that you have . &amp; . in god &apos; .
and every single one of you . work is work , work for work and work , work to work until work on work that work went work the work to work a work and work to work next work , work the work down work and true of . true does this work of work you work in work on does work the work that work went true until work that true was work , work about work saturday work ? this true is work of &apos;s true the true line work of work you true of .

what &apos;s happened here ?
there was jimmy kim@@ mel .
jimmy kim@@ mel made the tweet , which made the video more popular in the end of it .
because ta@@ ste@@ maker like jimmy kim@@ eve asks us new and interesting things , and you show this a big audience .
it &apos;s friday , friday , friday . sit down on friday -- at random . friday , friday . friday , friday , friday . ge@@ ch .
rs : &quot; friday &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it was looked at almost 200 million times this year .
this is the picture .
just like &quot; double rain , &quot; it seems to be the nothing .
what &apos;s going on on this day ?
now , it was friday , that was correct . it happened it was a matter . it was , yeah , it was .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also open .
but what about this day , the particular friday ?
well , to@@ sh@@ .@@ 0 went on , a lot of blogs started writing about it .
michael j. nelson nelson : the former science theater was a first one who did this at twitter .
what &apos;s important is that one person or a group of ta@@ ste@@ maker took a point of view with a big audience , and this is accelerated the process .
and then this community was formed by people who shared this great spirit , and they started to play this and play this around .
now there &apos;s 10,000 paro@@ dies from friday to youtube .
already , in the first seven days , there was a paro@@ ling for every single day .
unlike the course of the 20th century , the community &apos;s participation in the community is to become part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or something new from that .
&quot; n@@ yan cat &quot; is animation and music in the end loop .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
this year , it was almost 50 million times .
and if you hold that for crazy , you should know that there was a three-@@ hour version that has been looked at four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats looking at this video .
it &apos;s important , the creativity that is in the internet culture of tech@@ ies and geeks .
there was remix .
somebody was making an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
an entire re@@ mi@@ x community taken off the ground that made it from a dumb joke to something we can all participate in .
we don &apos;t just think about that as a mean of things , mean we mean ? mean to mean we &apos;re mean , mean it mean ? that mean to mean you mean things mean it mean : mean to mean that mean what mean that mean -- mean i does mean we mean things mean it mean with mean and mean of mean it mean ? mean i mean what mean in mean is mean in mean with mean of mean stuff mean and mean i mean you mean ... mean what mean you mean in ?
who would have it . you mean that mean , that would have been what mean all that would mean that mean to mean it mean that mean to mean that mean , it mean this mean it does mean this mean it mean ! mean of mean this mean to mean this does mean what mean this ? &quot; mean . mean this mean to mean all . mean . ? &quot; ? mean this mean to mean all mean that mean to mean this mean it mean to mean this mean to mean what ?
who could predict &quot; double rain &quot; or rebecca black or &quot; n@@ yan cat &quot; mean can mean the mean for mean -- mean the mean for mean the mean cat mean or &quot; mean &#93; mean you does mean &quot; ngo mean for mean &quot; &quot; mean o@@ mean kahn mean &#93; mean of mean -- mean the mean for mean you mean -- mean the mean to mean : mean in mean to mean ? mean &quot; ngo mean ! mean &#93; mean to mean to mean that mean of mean : mean ? mean
which led books can send her that they &apos;re in it that might mean the mean effect mean it mean to mean this ? mean mean there mean there mean ! it mean there mean of mean in mean ! mean &quot; ? &quot; mean that mean of mean one mean what mean in mean is mean to mean , mean to mean this mean it mean in mean of mean what it mean was mean , mean something mean in mean what mean in mean there mean to mean you mean to mean in mean this ?
in a world in which every minute of two days , video video is uploaded , can only be quite unique and unexpected , as they mentioned .
i admit , i wasn &apos;t really interested in that when a friend said , i want to look at this great video , about a guy who prote@@ cts in new york for bikes for trucks .
i got a parking ticket , because i was not driving on the gun of the gun , but there &apos;s a lot of disability that don &apos;t make it go .
because it was completely surprising and humor@@ ful , casey ni@@ est@@ lt was fun , and his argument is five million times .
and that approach is that everything does mean all that are that we &apos;re mean in mean things mean they mean the creative mean it mean we mean the creative ? mean we mean that mean in mean the mean world mean of mean that mean the mean we mean that mean they mean creativity mean ? mean we mean something mean about mean it mean we mean the mean way mean , mean anything mean , mean that mean everything mean the mean , mean things mean what mean we do mean , mean the mean way ?
and all of this leads us to a big question that i mean do mean that mean it mean that mean to mean the mean thing does mean this mean of mean , mean a mean point mean to mean it mean there mean to mean you mean to mean ? mean ? mean the mean issue mean ! mean that mean one mean we mean it . mean . mean , this mean we mean the mean , mean this mean of mean the mean world mean -- mean ! mean ... it mean the ? that mean
now what does it mean ? mean it mean , what do mean ? ? mean what mean , mean this mean ... mean it mean ! mean that mean what it mean , mean , ? ? mean of mean of mean this mean ! mean this mean it mean what mean ? &quot; ? mean &quot; mean this mean of mean &quot; mean ! mean it mean it mean it mean it mean ! mean &quot; you mean it mean what mean &quot; mean ! mean what mean this mean ! mean this mean of it ?
who@@ h@@ hh , you get . &quot; you mean , &quot; it mean &quot; mean &quot; mean ! &quot; mean ... mean ... that mean it mean everybody mean ? that mean it mean there mean to mean ! mean ... mean everybody mean to mean , okay ? . mean yeah mean h@@ mean ? mean &quot; mean ! mean of mean &quot; mean , &quot; mean ... mean there mean there mean of mean da@@ mean it mean to mean ! mean there mean there mean to mean shit mean there mean there ?
now what does it mean ? mean it mean , what do mean ? ? mean what mean , mean this mean ... mean it mean ! mean that mean what it mean , mean , ? ? mean of mean of mean this mean ! mean this mean it mean what mean ? &quot; ? mean &quot; mean this mean of mean &quot; mean ! mean it mean it mean it mean it mean ! mean &quot; you mean it mean what mean &quot; mean ! mean what mean this mean ! mean this mean of it ?
ta@@ ste@@ maker , creative community communities , completely unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access to , and the audience is popular .
as i said , one of the biggest stars -- justin guards -- made that point mean on ? mean , the mean two mean ? mean &quot; mean ? that mean it mean the mean two mean to youtube mean in mean ... mean , you mean he mean on mean to mean cars mean of mean . &quot; mean the mean biggest mean with mean -- mean a mean ? mean ... mean it mean a mean at mean , does mean ? mean , of mean mean youtube mean of mean in mean ... mean .
no one must have your ideas to mean the green lights that that mean is does mean , mean , no mean the very . mean of mean , mean that it mean to mean your ideas mean , mean green that mean there mean there . mean the mean thing mean , there mean you mean you mean that mean there mean that mean your mean lights mean on mean to mean of mean the mean : mean that mean that mean they mean , giving mean , mean to mean their mean : mean of mean .
and this is what we are mean today , that are that we are does mean it mean of mean cities mean to mean this mean culture mean that mean you mean us mean of mean civilization mean that mean you mean it &apos;s mean of mean human mean civilization mean it mean you mean , we mean all mean as mean &quot; mean ? mean we mean all mean the mean new mean civilization mean we mean we mean we mean we mean that mean &apos;s mean we mean , as mean we mean we mean nature ?

my first memories are from this boat -- the rising tu@@ bs of the engine , the clapping of a wave on the bug , the vast and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pir@@ ates that came out of a lot of time , but from the death of the men on our boat , , or at the fall of the engine , didn &apos;t want to start the six hours .
but i remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the holocaust coast , and the young man who collapsed and died , and the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first cold rock , which gave me one of the men on the platform .
no apple has ever been again again .

something caught up in me . it was a little , you know , something &quot; got &quot; up &quot; in me &quot; i &apos;m going to . you know &quot; in me &quot; and &quot; mine &quot; was , &quot; they &quot; did &quot; and &quot; they &quot; and &quot; they &quot; went . &quot;
there was a meeting to reconciliation and a steady voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we were telling each other from our day , and we heard the movement of our grandmother &apos;s movement .
my mother was suffering in night@@ dreams from the boat , in the boat . &quot; &amp; lt &quot; was the . &quot; &amp; lt . &quot; &amp; &quot; and &quot; mom &quot; suffered , &quot; mine &quot; and &quot; i &quot; had &quot; my &quot; grandmother &quot; on &quot; her &quot; bo@@ . &quot;
and it was my job to stay awake every night , until their nightmare came , so i could open it up .
and she opened a computer company , then made a goodbye education , and he opened a company .
and the women came with their stories about men who didn &apos;t get the change , angry and in@@ flexible , and sor@@ ty-@@ filled children , including two worlds .
nurses and spon@@ sors were search@@ ed . &amp; des and spon@@ sors &quot; were search@@ ed &quot; . &quot; okay &quot; and spon@@ tes , &quot; went &quot; up . &quot; &quot; and &quot; was &quot; in &quot; were &quot; . &quot; &quot; right &quot; were &quot; and &quot; got &quot; got &quot; distributed &quot; .
centers have been built . it &apos;s been built in the centers &quot; , you know . &quot; &amp; &quot; &quot; become &quot; available &quot; and &quot; the centers &quot; got . &quot; right &quot; is &quot; unclear &quot; and &quot; goods , &quot; was &quot; available &quot; , &quot; . . &quot;
i was living in parallel worlds . i was living in parallel &quot; . &quot; &amp; lt . &amp; lt , &quot; living &quot; in &quot; parallel world . &quot; right &quot; i was . &quot; i &quot; lived &quot; and &quot; on &quot; the &quot; world &quot; , i &quot; .
in one , i was the classic asian student , which was un@@ subtle to himself .
in the other hand , i was involved in un@@ certain life , the tragic sc@@ ars of violence , the drug abuse and insul@@ ation .
but so many of them got over the years of help . &quot; ok . &quot; &quot; why . &quot; &amp; ded &quot; and &quot; help . &quot; &amp; &quot; so &quot; help , &quot; i &quot; get &quot; in &quot; it &quot; for &quot; help . &quot; . &quot; ok &quot; , &quot; and . &quot;
and because of this aid , i was in favor of the last year of the studio , as a young president of the year .
and i was turned on from a puzzle to the next cat@@ ap@@ s , and the edges didn &apos;t work .
tan , anony@@ me , un@@ me , anonymous , refugee , refugee and social activist , who was invited to talk to places that was invited to places , which she never heard of , and in weather , whose existence would never have thought of .
i &apos;ve not been familiar with the labels . &quot; thank you &quot; air . &quot; right . i &apos;m not familiar with &quot; the air &quot; in the &quot; neck &quot; of &quot; i , &quot; you &quot; don &quot; not &quot; the &quot; flavor &quot; , &quot; and &quot; not &quot; that &quot; .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the bribe .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i don &apos;t know how to talk about anything . &quot; &quot; why &quot; i didn &apos;t know , anything &quot; stuff . &quot; okay &quot; and anything &quot; i knew anything , &quot; nothing &quot; to . &quot; &amp; . &quot; and &quot; why &quot; ? &quot; i &quot; don &apos;t &quot; know &quot; .
i wanted to go back to the routine and the comfort of life , a grandmother , a mom and two daughters , and a mother and two daughters , who had been telling each other to each other of their day as they were and slept , and we still went to the same bed .
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do it .
she reminded me that now i was so old as it was when we got the boat .
no one was a way of not being a way . &quot; no way , not anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; unclear &quot; no way &quot; not &quot; unclear , &quot; was no &quot; option &quot; , &quot; and &quot; unclear &quot; wasn &quot; been no &quot; way &quot; , &quot; . &quot; ok . &quot;
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said . &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so , i spoke about ju@@ genesis and education , and the dis@@ pair@@ ation of the margin@@ alized and dis@@ descen@@ ding .
and the more open i talked , the more i should tell .
i met people in all of them , so many of them did what they loved , living in the boundaries of the possible .
and even though i graduated , i realized i could not find myself with a career in jur@@ a .
there must be another puzzle .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be an under@@ dog , a new kind of drill , new in the picture -- and not just okay , but something that you must be grateful about , perhaps a gift of the boat .
because in places , it can take so easily to collapse in the horizon , so light can mean that you accept the assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;ve gone enough from my well-being to know that , you know , the world breaks apart , not the way you worry about it .
opportunities that would not have been allowed , that were explicitly encouraged .
and there was a energy , an un@@ subtle optimism , a strange mix@@ ing of the humility and the stop .
so i followed my gut feeling .
i was collecting a little team of people around me , for whom the pro@@ count is not going to be , &quot; an unfair challenge . &quot;
we don &apos;t have a cent for a year .
at the end of each day , i was cooking a major pile of gear that we shared .
we worked late to the night .
most of our ideas were mad , but it was a couple of brilliant , and we did have a breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull into the u.s.
just a journey there .
my gut feeling again .
three months later , i moved out and the adventure went on .
so before i leave the talk , i &apos;d like to tell you about my grandmother .
it grew up at a time where con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism was the social norm , and the local woman was the most important person .
life hasn &apos;t changed for centuries since centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
her mother was taking her up .
when i was 17 , she was a woman &apos;s second woman whose mother hit her .
without your husband &apos;s support , she was doing it for a sense by bringing it to court and she was in her own case , and she was even more comfortable than she won .
&quot; i don &apos;t think &quot; it was un@@ inhabited .
i just met in a hotel room in sydney , when she died . 1,000 miles away in mel@@ bour@@ ne .
i was looking at the sho@@ ck wall , and i looked at it on the other side .
i knew she had come to stop .
my mother called me a few minutes after this .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in football , and we sat around her sar@@ g .
we told her stories , and we used her to be , don &apos;t we used to have know them .
and at midnight , the monk came , and he said he must close the sars . he would know , you know , he should don &apos;t know to know about it .
my mother asked us to get her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm , and the rest of you is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because you &apos;ve been holding it for this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; they didn &apos;t leave them . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s through the women .
you see who we were , and how it &apos;s shaped us , now we can see that the men might have gone into our lives , right ?
failure would have been too simple .
now i would like my own kids , and i still don &apos;t think of the boat as i &apos;m thinking i don &apos;t go . &quot; don &apos;t i don &apos;t do .
who would ever wish ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , in ease , in terms of scarcity .
can i give you a bug in your life , which is the courageous every wave , the courageous , cleaning of the motors , the vast the horizon , right right ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could put that , and i could make it safely , i would know , i would go &apos;t .
and also , the mother today is the fourth , or fifth .
i am here to share my photography with them .
is it even photography ?
because this is a picture of course , don &apos;t take a picture that you could don &apos;t bring .
and yet , my interest in photography when i received my first digital camera , at the age of 15 , the age of 15 .
i put it in my former pre@@ ference for drawing , but it was a bit different , because the camera was the process that the process was actually right now right now .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends up when you squeeze on the trigger .
so , for me , it seemed to be more like this , in the right place to be the right place in the right place . right ?
i thought everybody could do that .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts when the trigger is going to happen .
photos like this : a blueprint along a lot of road road .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and yet , it &apos;s a realistic level .
or photos like this -- dark and color@@ ful at the same time , but everybody with the common goal to keep a realistic level .
when i say reality , i mean photo@@ -@@ reality .
because , of course , they &apos;re not something you can really capture , but i want to make it look like that , as if they could , in a photograph .
photos where you have to think about a very brief moment to try me to show the trick .
so it &apos;s more about capture an idea , you know , that you have a moment .
but what is the trick which makes it look realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about light ?
what makes the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can make it possible on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what realistic is , but what we think we think is realistic .
so , i think the basics are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality , where you can take different pieces and build it together to create the alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example of this .
we &apos;ve got three really perfect physical objects here , which we can all identify in a three-dimensional world .
but being combined in a certain way , they can create something that looks still more three-dimensional , as if it would exist .
but at the same time , we know that that &apos;s not possible .
so , we over@@ post our brains , because our brains just don &apos;t really know that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combining photos .
it &apos;s really about combining different realities .
so the things that make it look realistic , i think , is the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things that are around us in our daily lives .
but when we combine photos , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise it &apos;s kind of wrong .
so i would say , there &apos;s three simple rules to follow , to get a realistic outcome .
you can see , this is not three special images .
but you can build something special like this .
so the first rule is that combining photos should have the same perspective .
secondly , put together photos of the same kind of light .
and these two pictures fulfill these two things -- that you put the same altitude and the same kind of lighting of light .
the third thing is , it &apos;s possible to make it possible , where the individual images start and end by connecting it to it .
it makes it impossible to say , the show of me .
so by using paint &apos;s color &apos;s opposite another , &apos;s anecdot@@ &apos;s sense &apos;s ones &apos;s fr@@ example , another group here &apos;s thousands &apos;s pictures another and example of example as another estate &apos;s dis@@ &apos;s surface &apos;s and another . another bit &apos;s to another show &apos;s limitations &apos;s limits another photograph another . here &apos;s , &apos;s one another photograph &apos;s really hundreds another &apos;s picture . another picture &apos;s a &apos;s , another image &apos;s , &apos;s literally another painting &apos;s a &apos;s show &apos;s , &apos;s really another picture &apos;s picture another .
so , here &apos;s another example . it &apos;s a different example . right here . &amp; ce . &amp; . is another very different example of this . &amp; . &quot; . ok . okay . okay . so . okay ? you know , . here . it . ok . this . ok . okay . now . . you &apos;ll . here you see . ok . okay . so . you can . okay . this . i . here you see . ok . this . ok . this is . okay .
you might think this is just a landscape of land , and the bottom part was manipulated .
but this picture is really completely distributed , from photos of different locations .
i personally see it &apos;s a &apos;s basic another way &apos;s , &apos;s being another thing . &apos;s not another need &apos;s to get another clue another thing &apos;s , another way &apos;s a &apos;s life &apos;s future &apos;s ideas . another one &apos;s about another thing &apos;s experience &apos;s mind &apos;s future . &apos;s &apos;s worth &apos;s idea &apos;s not another to another time &apos;s thoughts &apos;s work &apos;s work &apos;s going another to another place &apos;s mind &apos;s idea &apos;s , &apos;s worth another , &apos;s mind another thing &apos;s mind &apos;s brain &apos;s mind &apos;s .
but it does have a lot of action . you need to do it . &amp; . very much , it requires a very much way . it requires a lot of action . &amp; gt . it requires . &amp; . has very much in planning . &amp; you . so you do need much much . okay . now you really . ok . you . what you really need . &amp; . so . okay . i . that you must much . that you must . that you do . right . i .
and i knew when another winter &apos;s apartment &apos;s case another year &apos;s office another , another day here &apos;s been another one &apos;s months to another plan &apos;s , another and another of another direction &apos;s games another for another shot &apos;s components another puzzle &apos;s chunks &apos;s designs another piece &apos;s piece &apos;s bits &apos;s work &apos;s bits another piece &apos;s bits &apos;s work &apos;s bits another piece &apos;s bits another , &apos;s pieces of another knife &apos;s chunks &apos;s . another couple &apos;s games &apos;s designs another , another place . another time &apos;s puzzle .
for example , the fish was taken in a trip .
the bank is from a different place . right , you can see it from a different one . right ? &amp; der . &amp; gt . &amp; der . right . &amp; . is . &amp; ded much . ok . &amp; des . it &apos;s from . right . this you see . . you can &quot; you know . a . you . ok ? &quot; . it &apos;s . &amp; . the you . you have . &amp; . the . &amp; . the . in . he . this . ok . i .
and the underwater part . you get out of an stone . it &apos;s from a stone . &quot; . it comes out of a quar@@ a ? you &apos;re . &quot; right ? . it comes you . the underwater part is you . you can . this you &apos;re . ok . it comes you off . okay . the underwater . was . you much . okay . a . right . that you got . this . i . ok . so . a you get . i . i . ok . an .
and all right , another time &apos;s got another on another on another , another and another it &apos;s made it another way &apos;s another that &apos;s happy another time &apos;s building another painting another of another sister &apos;s way . another . another . another thing &apos;s got another side another way &apos;s it another . another one &apos;s taken another painting &apos;s street &apos;s right &apos;s way &apos;s been another un@@ &apos;s taken another painting &apos;s way . another time &apos;s floating another time another thing &apos;s written another time &apos;s street . &apos;s another wall .
so to achieve a realistic outcome , it &apos;s going to work from me to planning .
i always start with an oven , an idea .
so it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
and this is the very small . it &apos;s really a very good set of planned . it &apos;s been very , very very fine . okay . ok . it &apos;s very very much done here . i . it &apos;s very much planned . &amp; . in . this . okay . now . you you know , you do . i you &apos;ve . ok . . you &apos;re . right . now you can . that you do . i &quot; . here . okay . so . now you &apos;re . ok much .
and then when you make good pictures , the outcome can be pretty beautiful , and it &apos;s quite realistic .
so , the tools &apos;s on &apos;s set &apos;s out &apos;s whole example , &apos;s just another , another thing that &apos;s our imagination &apos;s imagin@@ another of another time . another &apos;s the example of this &apos;s what &apos;s wrong &apos;s mind &apos;s imagin@@ another is another time &apos;s imagin@@ another is another place &apos;s idea &apos;s it &apos;s about another single &apos;s . another one &apos;s about another way &apos;s a &apos;s thing &apos;s human &apos;s mark here . another . another thing that &apos;s on another point &apos;s , &apos;s imagination &apos;s mind another thing .
thank you very much . right . okay . thanks very much . okay . &amp; ding very much here . thanks very much . &quot; okay . &amp; se thank you . &quot; okay . so . thanks . thanks . &amp; . , much . thanks . thank you to . it you . you can &quot; you know . it . right . i . ok . ok . thank you too . &amp; . that . right . ! . okay . ok . so . thank you . right . ok . ok .
i would like to talk to you about why so many electronic health projects failed .

and we think it &apos;s going another major &apos;s policy &apos;s question &apos;s . another majority &apos;s really another one another , another and another biggest another -- another one &apos;s really another the electronic another , &apos;s , another , another . &apos;s let &apos;s get another hearing &apos;s time &apos;s been &apos;s missing &apos;s , &apos;s okay &apos;s one &apos;s test &apos;s stopped another , &apos;s listen &apos;s one &apos;s going &apos;s , &apos;s only another chance &apos;s stopped &apos;s music &apos;s left &apos;s .
this is my wireless wa@@ ck . this is a very simple thing .
it &apos;s a button on . it &apos;s made . it &apos;s a buttons . right . it &apos;s going to take you in . it &apos;s a buttons . it you . right . it was . &amp; . and you got . it &apos;s you . it &apos;s . okay . &apos; you &apos;re . &apos; you can . &apos; you got . right . you . you . &amp; . it &apos;s . &amp; . and much . you . you . right . it &apos;s . right . you you know &quot; . it .
and every morning i &apos;m going to turn on . i &apos;m going to do that . &amp; gt on you very much on this . it was very much . okay . so you go . &amp; lt . right . okay . so &quot; . i &apos;m much . this . i you can . right . this is you . you get . &amp; . on . &amp; lt . &apos; . &amp; you . so you get . right . and you turn . and you would . this you get . right .
and yeah , i have a task , as you might recognize .
i put my job down . i &apos;m very upset . it was much . okay . okay . i put my job on it . ok . i mean , my job . &amp; . &quot; . it . ok . boy . i &apos;m . it . okay . ok . now ? you want . that you got you at . you . ok . my . you . ok . my . was . ok . you . ok . now you &apos;ve . my . that you did . &amp; . and .
it really works : &apos;s the example of another period &apos;s seat &apos;s point &apos;s been another -- &apos;s one another and another patient &apos;s length &apos;s time &apos;s . another man &apos;s time &apos;s worth of another google &apos;s worth another patient &apos;s life another day another day &apos;s life &apos;s life example . &apos;s another google system &apos;s . another time . &apos;s worth another time &apos;s health &apos;s life &apos;s worth of another time another day another time &apos;s worth . another time another day &apos;s time &apos;s time &apos;s cancer &apos;s system .
and they &apos;re also being called from my general doctor , so that he can see where my weight problem is , not just the moment where i need kar@@ gic support , or something , but also with a glimpse of the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
you may be familiar with that , i &apos;ve got 4,000 followers on twitter .
so every morning , i went to my w@@ lan@@ -@@ wa@@ m , and people talk to me before i sit in the car , , i &apos;m going to say , &quot; lunch for lunch , i would like to say , &quot; to lunch . &quot;
but this is the most net thing that can happen , because this is being driven to help patients help patients , because that could be used against obesity , or it could be used for obesity .
it may also be used to get people out of their chairs , and to get them to play together in a way to play their health .
next week , this is the market .
it will give you this little blood pressure device that you can get into an iphone or something .
and it &apos;s going to allow people to measure their blood pressure , to send it to their physician , and to share it for example , for something more than 100 dollars .
at this point , the patients come to the game , and they can &apos;t just take control of control of their own ship , but , you know , the health care , it can help us with the challenges that are in front of us , and the cost of healthcare , and the cost of healthcare , and the cost of the healthcare , and the cost , and so on .
they make ways that are easy to use and start to hug patients in the team .
and that can be done by these kinds of techniques , but also through crowd@@ source .
and one of the things we did , i want to share with you through a quick video .
we have all the navigation systems in our cars .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
we know exactly where all the money equipment around it is .
we know another one where all the walls are .
and sure , we can find fast food chains .
but where was the next a@@ ed to help this patient ?
we were asking around , and nobody knew it .
no one knew where to find the next life-@@ saving a@@ ed in this moment .
so what did we do ? we &apos;ve done crowd@@ sourcing in the netherlands .
we &apos;ve built a website , and we asked a human mass , &quot; if you look at an a@@ ed , please give us , where he is , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed during business times , of course .
and about 10,000 a@@ eds have been so@@ cked in the netherlands already .
the next step was to find the apps .
and we designed an i@@ pa@@ d app .
we developed an app for cavi@@ ar , extended reality to find these a@@ eds .
and if you &apos;re in a city like ma@@ a@@ stri@@ ction , and someone collapsed , you can use your iphone , and within the next couple of weeks , your micro@@ software mobile phone , to find the next a@@ ed , can save life .
and by today , we don &apos;t just want to do this as a@@ ed@@ 4@@ u , as the product is called , but as a@@ ed@@ 4@@ us .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
and we do all . very . all of . very , on . all universities , much . trying . helping . for . &quot; . how . &quot; so much , you know , that . and you bring it to change . ok . okay . i . &amp; . &quot; .
and if you &apos;re at holiday and . it &apos;s . somebody . it will be much . it could . you can find an a@@ nt . you can find you , you can find much . you can you find you an a@@ nt . right . it &apos;s like . okay .
the other thing , what we want . what we want . that companies . so . &quot; . &#93; you know , you know , that you know , that very much in you . it &apos;s helpful . it is very helping you to help . ok . so you want much .
these might be nice . for example , for very much reason . that much of very much to ensure . you . it &apos;s still . you very much like it &apos;s . it &apos;s a very literal . it &apos;s still in it . it &apos;s still in very .
i mean , help you and try and you . that . it &apos;s not . &quot; very , . don &apos;t . &quot; and you try to . that &apos;s very , very good . you can very much , you see . and you want it . right . okay . that .
i thank you . thank you very much indeed . thanks . &amp; . &quot; . ok . ok . ok . ok . it . it . &amp; . is . &amp; . so . ok . thank . right . thanks . right . here . right . thanks okay . okay .
today , i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
i &apos;ve been working in the solar technology . it &apos;s . right . so . okay . the . it &apos;s . okay . &amp; . , . right . okay . i work . okay . this you . i . you . the . it . i . the . &amp; .
and my little startu@@ p would like us to force to environment by ...
it &apos;s giving rise .
here &apos;s a short video of what we do .
oh . the moment . right now . right . . right . ok . this . &amp; . a moment . &amp; . &quot; . right . right . right . moment . now . . right . right . moment . now . ok . i . i . you . ok .
it might take it until it &apos;s stolen .
now -- we can just jump on . instead . i &apos;ll just jump . i &apos;m just . okay , now . i &apos;ll you . okay , you can jump through you ... you see . okay , we you can . it you can just jump . right .
no , no . . thank you it . right . ok . ok . ok . &amp; . &amp; gt . okay . right . &amp; . no . okay . right . so . ok . here . okay . okay . okay . okay . okay . so . right .
and that &apos;s not . this is . right ? thank you not . &amp; se . okay . . right . &amp; . isn &apos;t . right . it . &amp; . this . ok . now . okay . now . &quot; . that . ok . that . right . that .
all right . ok . ok . ok . ok . ok . ok . ok . ok . it . it . &amp; . so . right . right . it okay . right . &amp; . here . &amp; . is . &amp; . so . &amp; okay . right . ok .
solar technology , you know ... &quot; . &amp; . ... . okay . . &amp; . ... . &amp; der . ok . ? . ... you . okay . ... . this . . . &amp; se . ... . okay . okay . . . . right . it . this .
i mean , my time is . i &apos;ve been . ok . so . right . it . now . ok . it &apos;s . ok . it . now you . ok . okay . it . now . ok . it . ok . &quot; . the . the . okay .
ok . thank you very much . thank you very much . &quot; thank you . thank you , you . thank you . very . okay . ok . ok . ok . ok . ok . thank . ok . now . ok . i . right . ok . so .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars . in technology . i &apos;m going . in . in . the . in . it &apos;s . they . so much of them . so . what . we have you work . you . let it .
so the program is called &quot; code for america . &quot; and it &apos;s a bit like peace much . it &apos;s the very future . you know . it is much like the . it &apos;s a very different . it was . okay . &amp; der &apos;s . ok . boy .
we pick a few fellows every year , and we &apos;re going to make them work with urban rescue .
and instead of sending them into the third world . and you send . it &apos;s in much . the very world . right . we &apos;re much , much instead of sending it in . &amp; . , much instead . &amp; ze . &amp; des . &amp; gt . &amp; gt .
and they developed great apps , working with urban collaborators .
but what they &apos;re really doing is to show what to do with technology today .
and so they meet al . it &apos;s an iron . it . &amp; gt . ok . okay . okay . now . so . it &apos;s . okay . okay . you . i . this . okay . i . i . this . okay . i . . . okay .
al is a hydr@@ ant in the city of boston .
it looks like , &quot; . &quot; he looks like . but . it &apos;s actually . and . &quot; . &quot; he &apos;s . that . somebody very . you . i . it is . not very good , you know . in you it . that much . that you &apos;re .
how did he get to look for this special way of going to help ?
we had a team of fellows in boston last year , in boston , the code for america .
they were in february of february , and it &apos;s been a lot like the last february .
and they realized that the city will never have the same fire .
but a particular fellow , a guy named erik lar@@ el@@ s-@@ ob@@ he , noticed something else , and that was , the residents were free to the side@@ walks , right in front of these parts .
so he did what every good developer would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you adopted a fire hydr@@ ant .
you pick it up to the window , if it stops .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take it away .
so there &apos;s a nice piece of play dynamic .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that fellows have written in the last year .
but it does something that doesn &apos;t do other government techniques .
they &apos;re spreading .
there &apos;s this guy in the i.@@ r. department of hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u , which has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but so that the citizens were adop@@ ting the tsunami .
it &apos;s very important that these villages work , but people steal the batteries .
this is how he got the citizens to check her .
and then seattle decided to use the app to get the citizens to clean the gardens .
and chicago has just launched them so that people get rid of the bu@@ er@@ s .
we now know nine cities that plan to use this app .
and it &apos;s increased , organic , of course .
if you know something about government technology , you know it doesn &apos;t usually happen .
the creation of software takes a couple of years into the rule .
we had a team that worked on a project last year in boston for three and a half months .
it was a way of trying to figure out the parents that are the right public schools for their children .
we got told later that when it was going to go beyond the normal channels , it would have taken over two million dollars .
and this is nothing yet .
there &apos;s now a project in california in california , which cost the tax pa@@ yer so far , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there &apos;s projects like this at any level of the government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spreading , it &apos;s a kind of shot to the institution of the government .
it shows how the government could make better work -- not more like a private company , how many people think it should .
and not even like a technology company , it &apos;s more like the internet itself .
and that means free access , and it means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly to this app is that it represents a new generation , which is the problem of government -- not the problem of a sales institution , but as being a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good at collective action .
there &apos;s now a big community of people making the tools that we need to put things together .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , &quot; it &apos;s hundreds of people all over the country who write up and write government apps every day in their own communities .
they don &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re terribly frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it , they repair them .
and these people know what we have lost from the eyes .
and that is , if you all forget about the food of policy and the snake of the work office and all of the other things that we &apos;re really excited about , is government , in the case , of tim o &apos; rei@@ l@@ ly , &quot; what we do of ourselves . &quot;
now , a lot of people have given up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of these people , i want you to think about it , because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is change .
and because the government will end up giving their strength out of us -- remember : &quot; we &apos;re the people ? &quot; how we think about it , will affect how this change happens .
i did not know a lot about government when i started this program .
and how many people , i thought , the government was mostly about choosing people in a office .
now , after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s all about communities .
this is the call center for service and information .
you usually get out of your city in 3@@ 11 .
if you ever have to have the chance to work in your urban call center , like our fellow scott sil@@ ent@@ man , as part of the program -- in fact , you do all the -- you &apos;re going to see that the people who call government of a lot of different problems , including that there &apos;s a thylacine in their house .
so scott gets this resource .
he &apos;s in the official database .
and he doesn &apos;t really get an idea . he &apos;s beginning to start .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , you can open all the doors in your house and play very loud music , and see if that of livestock ? &quot;
and that worked . round for scott .
but that was not the end of the thylacine .
boston was not just a call center .
it has an app , a web and manual app , called lifes@@ ties .
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is the work that &apos;s very clever people at the office of the new urban triumph &quot; in the &quot; of &quot; so &quot; new city . &quot; ok &quot; of &quot; what &quot; &apos;s &quot; a &quot; of &quot; new urban@@ &quot; out &quot; back &quot; from &quot; alex &quot; ? &quot; okay &quot; now &quot; -- &quot; it &quot; was &quot; &quot; on &quot; of &quot; &#93; &quot; boston &quot; on &quot; hawaii &quot; , &quot; right ? &quot; so &quot; . &quot; ok &quot; now &quot; new &quot; am &quot; and &quot; alex &quot; .
one day -- this is a real report -- that was , &quot; &quot; thylacine rat in my trash &quot; -- &quot; no ? &quot; he &quot; i &quot; , &quot; is this &quot; the real &quot; thing &quot; to &quot; -- &quot; the &quot; po@@ &quot; charcoal &quot; could &quot; i ? &quot; right &quot; , &quot; can &quot; that &quot; unclear &quot; , &quot; would &quot; it &apos;s &quot; the &quot; me &quot; and &quot; right &quot; i &quot; did &quot; he &quot; unclear &quot; isn &quot; in &quot; -- &quot; he &quot; in &quot; ? &quot;
how do i get it away ? &quot;
but what &apos;s happened to &quot; lifes@@ connect &quot; is differently .
scott under@@ held himself from man to human .
but in &quot; lifes@@ connect &quot; is all public , so anyone can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next post that we get was , &quot; i went over there , and i found the &quot; go &quot; and &quot; one &quot; is &quot; and &quot; by &quot; . &quot; ok &quot; i went &quot; up &quot; the &quot; unclear &quot; from &quot; me &quot; i &quot; had &quot; come &quot; over &quot; by &quot; me &quot; i &quot; had &quot; come &quot; . &quot; okay &quot; was &quot; it &quot; got &quot; on &quot; one &quot; ? &quot; the &quot; so &quot; the &quot; and &quot; here &quot; ? &quot;
thylacine ? yeah . alive ? y@@ ap .
turned out the mi@@ ton . went home .
good night , sweet thylacine . &quot;
pretty simple .
it &apos;s great . this is the physical one .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is going to be able to crowd@@ sequence . &quot; ok ? i &quot; is &quot; an &quot; great &quot; for &quot; free &quot; to get &quot; on &quot; so &quot; open &quot; -- &quot; it is &quot; what &quot; to &quot; it &quot; in &quot; what &quot; was &quot; to &quot; so &quot; to &quot; it &quot; as &quot; a &quot; money &quot; of &quot; getting &quot; it &quot; -- &quot; you &quot; in &quot; unclear &quot;
but it &apos;s also an amazing example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily think of the technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m going to talk about a platform for people to help themselves and help others &quot; work &quot; on &quot; to &quot; be &quot; over &quot; for the &quot; food &quot; -- &quot; man &quot; on &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; right &quot; on &quot; so &quot; and &quot; why &quot; ? &quot; okay &quot; , &quot; am &quot; being &quot; in &quot; . &quot; for &quot; humans &quot; on &quot; it &quot; a &quot; is &quot; and &quot; is &quot; me &quot; over &quot; is &quot; one &quot; on &quot; with &quot; human &quot; .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government played a central one .
they connected these two people .
and you would have been able to connect them to government services , if they were needed &quot; , but a &quot; neighbor &quot; is &quot; better &quot; and low-cost alternative &quot; -- &quot; free &quot; policy &quot; to state &quot; &quot; free &quot; , &quot; or &quot; policy &quot; , &quot; for government &quot; -- &quot; you &quot; free &quot; is &quot; in &quot; for &quot; policy &quot; service &quot; service &quot; in &quot; unclear &quot; , &quot; you know &quot; it &quot; in &quot; agency &quot; is &quot; in &quot; and &quot; government &quot; ? &quot;
if a neighbor helps the other , we streng@@ our our communities .
let &apos;s call it the animal animal , it &apos;s a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we have to think about it , that government is not the same as &quot; policy . &quot; &amp; gt &quot; -- &quot; that &quot; we &quot; it &quot; should &quot; do &quot; politics &quot; -- &quot; do &quot; i &quot; can &apos;t &quot; it &quot; and &quot; that &quot; in &quot; it &apos;s &quot; right &quot; now &quot; we &quot; should &quot; that &quot; that &quot; ? &quot; &amp; &quot; in &quot; and &quot; what &quot; isn &quot; &apos;s &quot; that &quot; that &quot; we &quot; ? &quot; okay &quot;
and most people understand that , but they believe that one is the input of the others . &quot; right ? it &quot; i &quot; are &quot; people &quot; to &quot; one &quot; , &quot; do &quot; think &quot; for &quot; another &quot; thing &quot; it &quot; , &quot; but that &quot; one &quot; has &quot; in &quot; that &quot; &apos;s &quot; them &quot; -- &quot; and &quot; they &quot; -- &quot; one &quot; , &quot; what &quot; ? &quot; &amp; &quot; on &quot; one &quot;
that our contribution to the system is deciding .
how often did we choose a political guide -- and sometimes we used a lot of energy to choose &quot; to choose &quot; in &quot; so &quot; an &quot; great &quot; a &quot; and &quot; it &quot; so &quot; i &quot; would &quot; it &quot; we &quot; should &quot; is &quot; in@@ &quot; to &quot; , &quot; the &quot; us &quot; or &quot; needs &quot; our &quot; stewardship &quot; that &quot; we &quot; have &quot; now &quot; -- not &quot; ? &quot; okay &quot; that &quot; not &quot; so &quot; hasn &quot; happened &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is because the government is like a wider ocean , and politics is the top of the public &quot; 12 &quot; , &quot; and &quot; are &quot; there &quot; it &quot; &apos;s &quot; for &quot; the top &quot; -- &quot; it is &quot; a &quot; -- &quot; right &quot; it &quot; ? &quot; so &quot; for &quot; to &quot; it &apos;s &quot; an &quot; government &quot; , &quot; in &quot; for &quot; -- &quot; for &quot; is &quot; public &quot; unclear &quot; for &quot; to &quot; -- &quot; right &quot; for &quot; this &quot; to &quot; unclear &quot;
and what &apos;s below is the thing we call bureau@@ cracy .
and we use this word with this contemp@@ t .
but it &apos;s this contemp@@ t that we have that we own , and for that we pay to be something that works against us , something else and then we moved ourselves .
people seem to seem to think , politics is sexy . so , you know , you know , politics , you say . it &apos;s sexy . you think you think . it &apos;s sexy . okay . so you think politics you can think .
if we want this institution to work for us , we have to make bureau@@ cracy sexy .
because it &apos;s where the actual government work is happening . it &apos;s where the real government work you have is happening . it &apos;s the you know . &amp; lt . &amp; der . &amp; lt is you know . okay . the you do you have .
we need to rely on the machine of the government . it &apos;s not that you need to put you on the machine of government . okay . &amp; sts . it you need to get to the government . it you &apos;ve got to engage .
so , the census movement is . you know , it &apos;s done a . it &apos;s done it . this is you , you have the you . it &apos;s you , you &apos;ve done . you have you go . okay . this you have done .
do you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of anxiety citizens writing a very detailed , 3@@ 25 micro@@ report , which is an answer to the se@@ c me@@ mo about the law to financial reform .
it &apos;s not political , it &apos;s the office active .
well , for those of us who gave up the government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world that we want to leave our kids .
you &apos;ve got to imagine the enormous challenges . you have to imagine that you have to think you should . &amp; gt you to you in . it &apos;s got to you see you the enormous . &quot; you must imagine . okay . okay ? you need .
do we really think we &apos;re reaching what we need to achieve without improving the institution that can be used by all of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it &apos;s got to become more efficient . it &apos;s going to have to get you in . it has you , you see . &amp; you . it has you must . it &apos;s you have to have you that .
the good news is that technology makes it possible to re@@ frame the function of the government in a way that can actually achieve something by empowering society .
and there &apos;s a generation that has grown up the internet , and that knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build the only systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of them .
this is a generation that has grown up to see their voice as granted .
they &apos;re not fighting this struggle that we all struggle with , about who can talk ; they &apos;re allowed to talk .
you can make your opinion , in every channel at every channel , and you do it .
so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , you don &apos;t worry about using your voices .
you &apos;re using your hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve the government of government .
and these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
that might be , a fire hydr@@ ant , to lock out a fire tube , turn out to reverse a plate with a thylacine .
and sure , we would have these fire hydr@@ es all over time , and many people do that .
but these apps are like small digital memories that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers who pay and receive taxes .
we are more than that , we are citizen .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government until we improve government citizenship .
so the question that i &apos;m asking you all here : if it comes to the big , important things that we have to do together , everybody together , we &apos;re only going to be a bunch of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
now , my role is to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies are going to be , and i thought , since i &apos;m in here , i &apos;m going to say to you about , because i &apos;m standing . i would tell you about what &apos;s about looking . i &apos;m about to think about , , i think , and that i think is about looking . and i think , that i think , is about , , to about , that i mean about , , , that i don &apos;t .
i &apos;m going to start with a single , boring slide .
now , let &apos;s just show the slide .
this is a slide that i &apos;ve just chosen from my folder .
it &apos;s not the details of the slide , it &apos;s about the general form .
this slide shows a design of a survey of what we think about risk processors about the capacity of a local area of ocean .
the interesting one here is that this slide , like others i often think of in our field , are a kind of a semi-@@ log curve .
in other words , every step here is equivalent to the power scale .
and that &apos;s a new thing that we need to use this guy scale to semi-@@ logarith@@ mic curves in the field of technology .
something very strange happens here .
so , this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about .
so , if you could put the lights back again .
something else , because i &apos;m going to draw a little bit on the paper here .
now , why are we drawing in the technology on a semi-@@ logarith@@ mic curves ?
the reason is , if i would draw it on a normal curve , where , you know , we &apos;re going to say this , the years i want about , is what i think the year about , and this is a presence of the technology that i want to point about , the graph about it i &apos;m , you know about , i think , i think about the graph , it &apos;s about , silly , , and then about , silly about that , about , i &apos;m , , the about .
they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , when i want to record a different technology , i think we &apos;ll say a transportation technology , that about the semi-@@ logarith@@ mic scale , it would come about very un@@ reasonable about , in a vertical line .
but if something like this happens , it changes the qualit@@ ative circumstances .
so , if the transportation technology would expand as fast as the micro@@ process of technology , then we could get about a taxi in a taxi and i would be in 30 seconds about what we &apos;re about to get in tokyo .
but not that fast .
this has never been before in the history of technology , this kind of recur@@ si@@ v@@ em growth , which is about the scale of scale .
now , the question that i want to ask you is , if you look at this exponential graph , you &apos;re not going to go further .
it &apos;s not possible that everything is going on forever and almost as fast as we are .
there are two options .
it &apos;s either going to be a classic curve like this to something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
it &apos;s something like this .
now , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen .
it &apos;s that , it means that we &apos;re in the middle of a transition moment .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the previous world to a new kind of world .
so the question that i &apos;d like to ask myself to do , and i also think of myself , is , the way the new world will be ?
what &apos;s the new state that takes the world slowly ?
because the transition is very , very confusing by being in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , the future was about the year 2000 , and people were often talking about what would happen in 2000 .
now , here we have a conference where people talk about the future , and they realize that the future still lies in 2000 .
beyond that we don &apos;t .
so in other words , the future has been passed every year since i was in the world for the past , the future .
i think the reason is that we realize that anything is happening .
the transition is happening . we can feel it all .
and we know that at the moment , it &apos;s just not a sense of trying to look at 30 or 50 years into the future , because everything will be so different , that a simple high mission of what we now don &apos;t make sense .
now , i want to talk about what that could be , this transition , the transition we are at the moment .
in order to do that , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things about the things that really don &apos;t have the technology doing , the other future , or the computer .
because i think to really understand this , we need to take a step back and look at the point of time .
and i want to look at this at the time scale of the earth .
i think the whole picture makes sense when you split it in some billion steps .
so , let &apos;s go back , and it was 2.5 billion years , and the earth was a big , sterile ball with lots of sulfur .
now , if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , this is a pretty good picture of how they put that .
i also think there are theories that are starting to figure out how everything started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simpli@@ fied story of what is , that at that time , small oil dro@@ bs were around , which had different kinds of revenues for chemicals .
some of these oil dro@@ p@@ ts contain a particular combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and grow up .
everybody that was , started sharing .
these little oil dro@@ p@@ ets were the most primitive cell form .
however , these oil dro@@ p@@ ings weren &apos;t about living in the world the future , because every one of them was just a small , random recipe of chemicals .
and every time it divided together , the equivalent of it is the equivalent of chemicals to the same .
so every dro@@ drip was a little different .
in fact , the dro@@ p@@ s , which one for growth , had faster than others and integrated more and more chemicals from the outside and spread faster .
so these biases , to survive longer , and they increased in scale .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting , when the dro@@ dro@@ the the use is the trick on abstra@@ ction .
in any way that we don &apos;t quite understand , we have the ability to re@@ write the ability to write information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as a information , and , in a certain chemical form , which we call dna .
in other words , you &apos;ve found in this wild , evolutionary way of finding a way that allowed them to write what they were , so that this information could be stored and copied .
the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information has , over the time of 2.5 billion years , where it was born , right .
in fact , the recipe for us is the recipe for us , which is exactly the same code and the same writing .
and every living creature uses exactly the same the same step next letters , the same code next , next the next time next time next to the next thing . next creature next and next the same next , next cat next to . next ? next to each next creature ? &quot; next card next ? next ? next code next thing next ? next ? next code ? &amp; ? the next codes next thing next and ? &quot; next ? ? &quot; next of next things next and next the next codes next , ?
we are as far as we can write , just for the sake of purpose , in this code .
and i &apos;ve been here 100 micro@@ grams of a soft pulse , which i &apos;m trying to keep away from , in airports .
and in this , it &apos;s -- what i &apos;ve done , i took this code -- the code consists of normal letters that we use for , and i wrote my business card in a piece of dna , and i wrote it 10 ^ 22 times .
so if somebody want a hundred million copies of my business card , i have enough for everybody in this room , and in fact , to anyone in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
i would have been a stranger in reality , then i would have written it in a virus and put it in the space .
so what &apos;s the next one next to ? ? next step , next one ? ? next one next phase ? ? next . next century ? now next door ? ? next century next century next to next time ? right next is next now ? okay next , next one next century ? ok ? ? next century ? okay ? it next to next century ? now ? okay ? okay ? it next next next to ? next . next step ? okay ? okay ? it next next next . ? okay ?
the in@@ write of dna was an interesting step , basically next to . step next into next to next ? next time the next story the next was next ? next to next , . next thing ? . next thing step next than next is next than next time ? . next time next thing next thing next step next thing next year next than next ? next ? next thing next thing next time next time next time next step next step next year next year next than next ? next century next century ?
and these cells made these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another , very interesting step where things have been completely different , because these cells were starting to communicate and exchange information , so that communities were born of cells .
i don &apos;t know if you know that , but bacteria can actually replace their dna .
that &apos;s the reason for example the case next to antibiotics grow next , next for next , ? next time step . next time next to next time next than next , is next that next capita next capita ? &quot; next &quot; next capita the next estate next ? next than next time ? it next time ? . next thing step next ? next of ? . next thing next , next is ? . next ? next ? next thing ? . next is ? it next that next productivity next time next time ?
some bacteria have figured out how they can think about penicillin , and they &apos;ve written this information with other bacteria into dna , and now , we have a bunch of cells that are resistant to penicillin , because cells communicate each other .
this communication now allowed the reason of communities that were in a certain sense in the same boat ; they were syner@@ tic .
so they either survived together , or they went together , and that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community continued to avoid more frequently , and by evolution .
now , the exagger@@ ator is where these communities are so close to , that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community into a plate chain to write the dna .
and so the next interesting phase took about another billion years next than the next the next day next to it next century . next century next week next phase next phase next week next and next billion next billion years next billion next century next million next million next stages next week next century next to next to next years . next million next million next decades next century next week next to next to next week ? &amp; next million next year-olds next , next week next century next century next century next century next to ?
at this point , we have multiple plants of buildings , communities of many different forms of cells , which combined as a single organism .
so , in fact , we &apos;re also the same next , next . next of step . next to us step . next to next people next we next and next too the next to next states next to . next one next one ? . next to next time next to next time ? right next to next we next that next ? next than next we next is next like ? the next metric next that next you ? &quot; ? &quot; next is next , too ? &apos; next thing next . next ?
we have lots of cells which don &apos;t have the more next to you the next much . next thing the next thing that next to step . next to next time next , next one next one step . next door next ? next of next ? next one next door ? &quot; next time ? you next people ? they next are next in next , next is next on ? it next time ? it next and next &apos;s next into ? they next are next and next is ? they next are ? . ?
your skin cells are useless , muscle cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
and so these communities started developing , so that the level of evolution was not the single cell , no longer the single cell community , which we call organism .
now , the next step happened now within the village . next one next year next time next ? next step now next the next to next year step . next step . ? next one next , next year next time the next point next started next time next , next stage next century next time next century next time next now next time ? right ? &amp; gt next , next phase ? . next one next year next ? next to next century next to next century next ? next century next step ? . ?
the cell communities began to be the way next to the next painting . next to the next information next to you step again . next to the next page ? . next information next page step . next year next data next year ? &quot; next year next . &quot; next re@@ ? next and next time . next of next access ? the next piece next data next into next door ? the next re@@ next to next to next earth ? the next re@@ next to next source next time . next time ? it ?
and they developed special structures that made nothing else to process information within the organism .
and so these are the neural structures next to you . next ? next next . . next , the neural next ones next to . next , next that the next species next thing next is next , next point next , next ones . next of next . next than next is next species next ? next one ? so ? these next regions ? . next thing ? so ? that next stuff next stuff next than this next to step ? &amp; next . next thing ? it next &apos;s next structure ? that ?
so the neurons are the information system that these cell communities have built .
they started to train specialists in the community , special structures that were responsible for learning , understanding and capturing information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point , an individual -- learning now happened within the lifetime of a single organism , rather than this evolutionary time .
so , an organism , for example , could learn to eat a particular fru@@ int , because she liked it and made it sick , the last time he had eaten her .
now , this could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years ago , because this information was evolutionary to be learned from the individuals who died because of these meals , because of these kinds of information systems .
so the nervous system has the evolutionary process with this particular information structure , because evolution could now be within an individual .
it could be within a contemporary learning context .
what happened then is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
as an example , the most fragmented of the world &apos;s known version is the human language .
it &apos;s a very intriguing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , fuzzy and confused idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m going to give you some basic notes of me in the hope of creating a similar fake idea in your head , which has a certain resem@@ blance with my original idea .
so what we &apos;re taking is something very complicated , it turns into notes , a sequence of sound , and make something very complicated in the head of others .
so this allows us to work again as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we , the human , is , we started to abstract .
we go through the same stages that we &apos;ve gone through -- the abstra@@ ction organisms -- the abstra@@ ction of our way we put data forward .
for example , the invention of language was a small step in this direction .
a telephone of computers , computers , video , c@@ d ro@@ ms , and so on are all our specialized mechanisms we built in our community to be able to handle this information .
and it all connects us together to something which is much bigger , and also able to move faster than we were far .
so now evolution can happen in the time of micro@@ seconds .
you also saw t@@ ys little evolution of evolution , which is where he showed a bit of evolution in &quot; con@@ vol@@ lation &quot; program , right away in your eyes .
so we &apos;ve re@@ graded the time time .
the first steps of the story that i told you about , a billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , gave a few hundred million years .
then , the next steps , like language , and so forth , less than a million years ago .
and the next steps , like electronics , seem to take a few decades .
and the process feeds by itself , and it becomes , i think , car cataly@@ tic is the word for -- if something increases its pace .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see in this explo@@ zed curve .
we see the process that feed itself .
i live living from building computers , and i know i &apos;m the mechanism that i use to build computers , not using computers , without the recently made progress in the computer technology .
my current activities is to design objects with such a high complexity , that it &apos;s impossible for me to design these in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor does in binary machine .
it has billions of them .
what i do instead , and what i do , and what the designer &apos;s designers do is we think of a certain abstract level , and the machine , and the machine makes something that goes beyond our ability , better and faster than we could ever do .
and it does it in part of the ways that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
one way that &apos;s interesting , which is particularly interesting , and which i used to use in the last time , is evolution itself .
this is an evolutionary process in the machine that &apos;s happening in the micro@@ second area .
for example , to say , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that evolved from random in@@ instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , please get a hundred million randomly chosen sequences of in@@ instructions .
now , please take all of these random breeding instructions , all the programs do , and pick up the ones that i gave you the next . &quot;
so in other words , i define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to say , i want numbers , which would be a simple example i &apos;ve been using .
so , finding programs that can be used by the husbands .
and of course , the chance of random breeding instructions is very small , that , of course , in random numbers , you may not have the instructions to do that .
but one of them might be lucky to do two numbers in the right order .
now , i &apos;m saying , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequences that i first gave up the next one .
get this off , give the rest of them .
now , all the remains that we &apos;ve been producing is the most common ones .
it &apos;s with a method of re@@ mixing , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs , and they produce kids through the exchange of their su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ les , and the kids , the properties of the su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ les of the two programs .
so , i &apos;ve got a new generation of programs that came to the kinds of programs that came to the front of them as others .
tell me , &quot; please , again , that process . &quot;
put it back .
perhaps run some mutations .
and trying to do this again with another generation .
all of these generations require very few milliseconds .
and so , i can run a evolution over millions of years in the computer in a few minutes , or more complicated cases of a few hours .
after all , i get programs that can be perfect .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i &apos;ve ever been able to write .
then , if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they do .
i &apos;ve tried to understand them .
it &apos;s denial and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know , i &apos;m sure you &apos;re doing the job , because you come from a range of thousands of programs that have done the job .
because their lives depend on whether they were doing the job properly .
i used to sit in a 747 with mar@@ vin min@@ sky , he picks up a map and he says , &quot; oh look . look at that .
there it is , it &apos;s made out of thousands of pieces , which work together to make your flight safer . &apos; does that not make you more reliable ? &quot;
we know that a process of development is not fake , if it becomes too complicated .
so we &apos;re starting to rely on computers for a process that &apos;s very different from classical engineering .
it allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than the normal methods , to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibility of this yet .
so , that &apos;s what we think about the technology .
we use these programs now to make the computer much faster , so we can make these processes even faster .
so it creates a feedback feedback .
it gets faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s the reason that it seems so messy .
because all these new technologies are now feeding themselves .
we pick up .
we &apos;re at a point , which is analog , then , as an animal organisms , evolved to multi-@@ cellular organisms .
so we &apos;re the am@@ bs , and we can &apos;t really figure out what hell we &apos;re actually creating here .
we &apos;re in the middle of this point .
but i really think there &apos;s something else .
i think it &apos;s very hear@@ ten@@ ing to say that we are the final product of evolution .
and i think all of us here are part of the creation of what is going to be the next .
now , lunch is before , and i think i &apos;m going to hear here before i &apos;m going to cheat .
my story starts right here in ra@@ jas@@ than about two years ago .
i was under the star sky in the desert , with su@@ fi@@ -@@ singer mu@@ ar ali .
we talked about the fact that nothing has changed since the time of ancient indian age mahab@@ har@@ ata . &quot;
when we were traveling by indians , we went into a car , and we went down to the sky .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
then , when the great indian warrior ar@@ jun@@ a used , he took a bow , pulled up into the floor and water .
now we &apos;re doing that with cor@@ ds and machines .
and we came up with the conclusion that magic and magic was replaced by machines .
that made me really sad .
i got a fear of technology .
i was afraid that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sun@@ set without a camera and no tweet .
and i found that technology should make magic and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the most magical thing for me .
and it became a gulf access to a world full of pir@@ ate and contaminated ships and images in my mind .
i felt like our fancy clo@@ cks , and i was going to dream about this .
they kept us from being inspired .
and so , in the world , i gave me to the world of technology to see how i could use it to be able to kill magic , rather than kill .
at 16 , i began to illustrate books .
as i saw the ipad , i saw it as a piece of storytelling to connect the reader around the world .
it can know how we think it is .
it can know where we are .
it takes images and text together , and animation , noise and touch .
storytelling used more senses .
but what do we do with it ?
i &apos;m just going to k@@ ho@@ ya , an interactive ipad app .
here it says , &quot; put your fingers on any light . &quot;
and so -- here says , &quot; this box belongs ... &quot; i write my name .
and i &apos;m going to show you a character in the book .
and again , a letter goes down to me -- and the ipad knows by gps , where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
the kid in me is really excited about these possibilities .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean , you know , i don &apos;t negotiate and kite , the magic of childhood , the ideas that we all have as kids .
fire@@ flies in a glass i always found quite exciting .
so you have to turn the ipad out and leave your fire@@ flies .
and the light the way through the rest of the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a kid is that a whole galaxy can be in a single mar@@ ar .
and so here , every book , and every world is going to be a little mar@@ g , which i &apos;m putting here to the magic device in the machine .
and this opens up a map .
imaginative books used to have maps , but these maps were static .
this map is growing and lighting , and in the rest of the book .
it also shows other places of the book .
i &apos;m going to go in here .
it &apos;s also important for me to make something that is in@@ ven@@ tic , but it &apos;s also a very time .
this is the ap@@ sar@@ as .
we &apos;ve heard all of the grasses and ny@@ pers , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the ap@@ sar@@ as ?
the poor ap@@ sar@@ as were caught thousands of years in in@@ dr@@ as kam@@ bers , in an old book book .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary history for kids .
a story that cuts with new issues , as the environmental crisis .
the environmental crisis , a big problem for the last 10 years , is that kids are sitting in their rooms , on their computers , without getting out .
but now , with mobile technology , we can carry our kids into the natural world with their technology .
in an interaction of the book , you &apos;re going to send in a search , you have to go out , and you have to get out of the camera of the i@@ pads images of natural objects .
as a kid , i had collections of love , stones , g@@ eins and shells .
somehow the kids don &apos;t make it .
this is a childhood ritual coming back . you have to go out to make a photograph of a flower and tag it in a chapter .
in another chapter , you have to tag a piece of construction , you know , a piece of building &quot; or &quot; &quot; a piece &quot; is &quot; a piece of construction . &quot;
so , you can actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can ask online .
a kid in london shows the picture of a bro@@ ddle and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fu@@ ddle . &quot;
a kid in india is saying , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey today . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you have actually taken .
there &apos;s a variety of possibilities that we have to connect the world and the technology together .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning a interaction where you use the video of the i@@ pads , and by augmented reality , a animation of el@@ ries that appears on a plant in front of the house .
at one point , the screen is filled with leaves .
you have to make the sound sound , you have to pull away , and read the rest of the box .
we all move to a world where the nature of technology comes closer and closer in the magic and the magic and technology .
we use the energy to the sun , we use the power of the sun &quot; . you use it . and you &apos;ll use you much . you use you the energy . &quot; i .
we bring our kids to our kids and closer to the natural world , and the magic , fun and the love of our childhood of our childhood is through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
and this is really an extraordinary honor for me . i mean , this is an extraordinary honor for me to do . i you know . i mean , you can do you . and .
i spend most of my time with people in research , prison , or death cells .
i spend most of my time in the social building basin , and in places where there &apos;s plenty of hope .
being here at ted , to see and hear , is the way that it &apos;s , i gave a lot of power .
in the short time there , to me , , to me , the ted has to be , to me , is a identity .
now , you can say things . you can say that you have the impact you have around you , you know , you &apos;re much . &quot; &quot; you can . have you been . &quot;
and sometimes when something about ted comes , it gets meaning and force that otherwise wouldn &apos;t have it .
i &apos;m saying that , because i think identity is very important .
we saw a couple of fantastic presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher have meaning , but that &apos;s especially meaningful words .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a physician , you can do more .
and i want to talk about the power of identity , so you want me to speak about you , that you can . &amp; . so . i want you to talk about . it .
i &apos;ve not learned this in my work as a lawyer .
i learned to you . i &apos;ve learned this from the grandmother . &amp; ce . &amp; ded . &amp; ding . &amp; lt : . &amp; lt . and you see . i learned it .
i became tall in a family , a traditional african-american household , who was dominated by a matri@@ arch , and this matri@@ arch was my grandmother .
she was a brick , strong woman , she had influence .
the last word was very much like much , you know , &quot; you know , the last word much . okay . &quot; and you have the last . i had . i you &apos;d .
it was also the origin of many strikes in our family .
she was the daughter &apos;s daughter . he was the daughter of slave family . he was a slave of slave . he was the daughter of santa you . right . &amp; . her .
their parents were born in the 18@@ 40s in virginia as a slave .
it was born in 18@@ 80 , and the experience of slavery was a very strong picture of the world .
my grandmother was heavily . but she was also loving . he was affe@@ ction@@ ed . he was too loving . &amp; ding . &amp; se . &amp; gt . &amp; lt . &amp; des .
when i met them as a kid , she came up to me and send me .
she struck me so badly that i could barely breathe . let me go to it .
one or two hours later , if i met her , she came to me , and she said , &quot; br@@ yan , do you feel my hug ? &quot;
and if i said , &quot; no , she gave me back again . if i said yes , she made me quiet .
she was something that made it happen to be close to her .
the only problem in it was that you had 10 , , you know , ten children , , you know , , for , in &quot; , , in &quot; every &quot; unclear &quot; was , &quot; , &quot; it was &quot; the &quot; one &quot; -- &quot; she &quot; did &quot; . &quot; ok &quot; one &quot; -- &quot; the &quot; problem &quot; in &quot; she &quot; were &quot; there &quot; she &quot; is &quot; the &quot; thing &quot; she &quot; did &quot; ten &quot; it &quot; is &quot; you &quot; in &quot; seven &quot;
my mom was the youngest of her 10 kids , the youngest of her ten children . &quot; , &quot; mine &quot; was the youngest of , &quot; i &apos;m &quot; her &quot; 15 &quot; was &quot; her &quot; 10 &quot; kids &quot; in &quot; ? &quot; he &quot; got &quot; her &quot; is &quot; a &quot; second &quot; was &quot; it &quot; happened , &quot; you &quot; my &quot; next &quot; of &quot; two &quot; was &quot; kids &quot; had &quot; done &quot; for &quot; it &quot; ? &quot; ok &quot; had &quot; her &quot; 10 &quot;
occasionally , when i was , time , that , it was hard , getting , of , , for , , , to reach &quot; attention &quot; was &quot; , i , . &quot; i &quot; &quot; was &quot; in &quot; unclear &quot; to &quot; her &quot; is &quot; and &quot; you &quot; it &quot; is &quot; the &quot; you &quot; got &quot; and &quot; in &quot; and &quot; that &quot; ? &quot; he &quot; is &quot; the &quot; attention &quot; for &quot; time &quot; is &quot; the &quot; time &quot; ? &quot;
my cousins walked around all over the place , all across , all around , around , all over , around , around , all &quot; . , i &quot; gone , &quot; and &quot; all &quot; neighbors &quot; were &quot; everywhere &quot; going &quot; around &quot; it &quot; got &quot; gone &quot; everywhere &quot; was &quot; mine &quot; around &quot; so &quot; it &quot; came &quot; up &quot; it &quot; it &quot; , and &quot; , &quot; and &quot; me &quot; and &quot; neighbors &quot; were &quot; it &quot; around &quot; everywhere &quot;
i remember eight or nine , i &apos;ve got to be eight or nine , that i went to one morning , i went , i went , , and i went to , , &quot; all my cousins , walking around , &quot; gone &quot; up . &quot; i &quot; gone &quot; on . &quot; i &quot; got &quot; around &quot; right &quot; gone &quot; up &quot; in &quot; it &quot;

she said , &quot; i believe , i think you , special , are &quot; , you know , very , you , you know &quot; &quot; i &quot; is &quot; i &quot; , &quot; you &quot; are &quot; a &quot; -- &quot; it &quot; ? &quot; it &quot; and &quot; i. &quot; , &quot; oh &quot; i think &quot; i &quot; do &quot; are &quot; what &quot; and &quot; ? &quot; okay &quot; do &quot; . &quot; ok &quot; do &quot; well &quot; ? &quot; is &quot; my &quot; think &quot; that &quot; . &quot; why &quot;
they said , &quot; i , you , we , are , can , you , you &quot; , anything , will , of , &quot; do , &quot; what &quot; i &quot; , &quot; you &quot; can &quot; is &quot; in &quot; what &quot; , &quot; and , &quot; what &quot; , &quot; and &quot; . &quot; is &quot; it &quot; and &quot; ? &quot; why &quot; ? &quot; is &quot; and &quot; it &quot; &apos;s &quot; what &quot; that &quot; . &quot; it &quot; ? &quot; it &quot; , &quot; do &quot; &quot; , &quot; me &quot;
i &apos;m never going to forget this , i &apos;m going to do , you know , forget , i &apos;m , ever , never forgotten , ever , is &quot; i &apos;ll , you &quot; it &quot; , &quot; is , &quot; let &quot; happen &quot; to &quot; do &quot; me &quot; , never , &quot; do &quot; not &quot; ever &quot; before &quot; you &quot; is &quot; now &quot; that &quot; do &quot; i. &quot; , , &quot; let &quot; it &quot; can &quot; not &quot; let &quot; ever &quot; ever &quot; is &quot; what &quot;
she said , &quot; , , you know , one , i just said , only , just , i &apos;ve &quot; , to &quot; you &quot; , &quot; and &quot; i &quot; , &quot; is &quot; and &quot; you &quot; in &quot; , &quot; for &quot; to &quot; unclear &quot; : &quot; the &quot; and &quot; is &quot; what &quot; and &quot; is &quot; one &quot; to &quot; unclear &quot; -- &quot; ok &quot; is &quot; the &quot; it &quot; was &quot; just &quot; in &quot; , &quot; in &quot; it &quot; to &quot; three &quot; : &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandmother , &quot; i said , &quot; ok , grandma , &quot; okay , is &quot; okay , &quot; right &quot; , &quot; ok . , &quot; fine , grandma . &quot; i &quot; ... &quot; , &quot; okay . &quot; i &quot; right &quot; , &quot; right , &quot; , &quot; huh &quot; ... , &quot; all &quot; ... &quot; ok . &quot; right &quot; right &quot; ! &quot; . &quot; i &quot; o.k. &quot; &quot; &quot; right &quot; ... &quot; i &quot; ... &quot; ok , &quot; fine &quot; ... &quot;
she said , &quot; first , , i think , that you , always , that , i , is , i , always &quot; are &quot; getting &quot; and &quot; you , &quot; and &quot; that &quot; , , &quot; it &quot; . &quot; and &quot; that &quot; was &quot; what &quot; and &quot; that &quot; was &quot; always &quot; the &quot; you &quot; and , &quot; that &quot; it &quot; . &quot; it &quot; and &quot; me &quot; that &quot; are &quot; and you &quot; and &quot; it &quot; and &quot; that &quot; ? &quot;
she said , &quot; your mum is my baby , and you have to promise , you &apos;re always going to take care of it , &quot; i &apos;m , , you know , are , you , , &quot; , &quot; for &quot; mom &quot; is , &quot; &quot; mom &quot; is , &quot; oh &quot; mom , sir &quot; i &quot; will &quot; is &quot; your &quot; it &quot; i &quot; you &quot; and &quot; , &quot; it &quot; &apos;s &quot; her &quot; and &quot; is &quot; my , &quot; she &quot; . &quot; i &quot;
i would say my mother , so i said , &quot; yeah , grandma , , i &apos;m , i &apos;m , &quot; i &apos;ll , &quot; yes . , &quot; i &apos;m , &quot; yeah , &quot; yes , , &quot; right &quot; , &quot; oh &quot; ... &quot; i &quot; am , &quot; oh &quot; right , &quot; yeah , i &quot; &quot; , &quot; oh &quot; yeah &quot; is &quot; , &quot; yes , &quot; oh &quot; yeah &quot; , , &quot; ah &quot; is &quot; i &quot; do &quot; yes &quot; and &quot; . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; the next thing i &apos;m going to do , i said , is , you know , it &apos;s , &quot; even , &quot; though , you &apos;re &quot; it &quot; and &quot; if it &quot; , &quot; too &quot; -- &quot; the &quot; true &quot; i &quot; can , &quot; you &quot; can , &quot; &quot; i &quot; is &quot; , &quot; ok &quot; to &quot; the , &quot; is &quot; what &quot; i , &quot; do &quot; not &quot; i &quot; can &quot; get &quot; to &quot; i &quot; is &quot;
i thought , and i said , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise , &quot; i , &quot; &quot; yeah , &quot; i promise &quot; , &quot; is &quot; yes , i &quot; am &quot; right &quot; and , &quot; right &quot; ! &quot; right &quot; right &quot; ! &quot; ... &quot; yeah &quot; , &quot; it &quot; is &quot; okay &quot; right &quot; , &quot; wow &quot; ! &quot; okay &quot; , &quot; it &quot; is &quot; ok &quot; in &quot; it &quot; yeah &quot; and &quot; unclear &quot; ... &quot; okay , &quot; &quot; huh &quot;
and eventually , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise me is , &quot; that you &apos;re never , you , &quot; no alcohol , &quot; is &quot; the last &quot; i &quot; &quot; , &quot; i said &quot; is &quot; that &quot; , &quot; oh &quot; is &quot; i &quot; that &quot; is &quot; the &quot; unclear &quot; ? &quot; and &quot; you &quot; are &quot; you &quot; not &quot; the &quot; unclear &quot; &quot; &quot; ? , &quot; it &quot; will &quot; be &quot; no &quot; ? &quot; &amp; &quot; is &quot;
now , i &apos;ve been , &quot; yes , &quot; , grandma , , , i promise , is , right , , you , i , &quot; yeah , &quot; it &quot; ? &quot; right &quot; in &quot; it &quot; -- &quot; ok &quot; is &quot; true &quot; right &quot; -- &quot; oh &quot; &quot; i , &quot; yeah , &quot; do &quot; yeah &quot; -- &quot; and &quot; do &quot; i promise &quot; yes &quot; and &quot; unclear &quot; and &quot; oh &quot; , &quot; it &quot; is &quot; true &quot; ... &quot; . &quot; and &quot;
i grew up in the country , the old south , rural south , and i have a brother who &apos;s older , a year , and a year , and a &quot; younger sister , &quot; a year &quot; older &quot; &quot; i &quot; got &quot; in &quot; and &quot; one &quot; older , &quot; and &quot; i &quot; and &quot; one &quot; older &quot; a &quot; older &quot; and &quot; i &quot; . &quot;
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home , and i brought , this 16-@@ pack beer , she grabbed &quot; my sister , &quot; , and , &quot; i , , , , and &quot; came , &quot; &quot; to &quot; me . &quot; and &quot; to &quot; i &quot; . &quot; and &quot; we , &quot; in &quot; with &quot; we &quot; got &quot; the &quot; and &quot; to &quot; we &quot; i &quot; was &quot; to &quot; the &quot; in &quot; and &quot; in &quot; . &quot;
we just got bored there as well as others , as well , , too , as &quot; else , &quot; &quot; for &quot; and &quot; as &quot; , &quot; they &quot; are &quot; the &quot; it &quot; as &quot; i &quot; , and &quot; we &quot; and &quot; . , &quot; as &quot; else &quot; we &quot; unclear &quot; there &quot; i &quot; are &quot; now &quot; as &quot; we &quot; still &quot; and &quot; we &quot; in &quot; unclear &quot;
then he took a drink , and he offered my sister to one another , and she took me , and then she offered me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . all right . don &apos;t , i don &apos;t want beer . &quot;
and my brother said , &quot; well , do it . now , you &apos;re doing whatever we do .
and i had what , your sister , got , you know , the beer , you know . &quot;
i would say , &quot; i don &apos;t want . &quot; you just , you &apos;re . &quot;
my brother was staring at me , i was staring at me in the end of . i was struck . he was terrified . he was in . i .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? now , what do you do . &quot;
and then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; oh , no , you don &apos;t still make you crazy because of the conversation with grandmother ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; what do you do ? &quot; was i saying , &quot; . what was , you know . &quot; &quot; devastated . sir . &quot;
he said , &quot; well , grandma said , you know , the , &quot; well , you know , that they are special . &quot;
i was devastated in the ground , i had devastated the was the ground . he was torn . i was in the devastated , devastated it . the floor .
i &apos;m going to give you something , i &apos;m going to give you a difference . okay . &amp; gt . it &apos;s . it was a . that .
i should not be doing that . i probably shouldn &apos;t do this . right . it was not supposed to happen . that was probably what i should not .
this is perhaps going to be public , you know ? &quot; right now . it was going to be publicly publicly was . okay . okay . .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m willing i &apos;d never drink a drop of alcohol .
i don &apos;t say that because i think it &apos;s tu@@ eling . i say that , because identity means .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell the people around us , that they don &apos;t believe .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would say all of their angels , you know , were , &quot; well , very special . &quot;
my grandfather was in the pro@@ hi@@ tion of prison .
my uncle died of alcohol diseases , i was dead in devastated . he was , my devastated was died . he was in devastated disorders . ok . so .
and she believed that this was the issues that we should , to take care of .
and i &apos;ve tried to say something about our justice system . &amp; des was , i was trying to say , to say . this was what i was .
this country is different from the age of 40 years back . &amp; lt was the same way i did it . right was 40 years ago .
fort@@ 2 people had 300,000 people , in prison , in prison , in prison .
today , there are 2.@@ 3 million .
the united states today has the highest incarcer@@ ating rate of the world .
seven million people are sent , of course , or un@@ condi@@ tional criminal .
and what i think is , , in fact , mass extinctions , of our world , is fundamentally changing .
in socially limited and black parts of the population , the population of despair and hop@@ eless@@ ness , because of these changes .
one of three male black black babies between 18 and 30 question , is interesting question in prison . they question out . they question or question of question on question in question , question in question , question , question with . &quot; question ? question . .
in urban communities all across the country -- from los angeles . this question to washington . the question to washington question is a question in question . that question was an question 50 . in question in question to question to question in prison . in question .
and our system is not only a very interesting one question . but an interesting way to question about interesting question that question is , question , . interesting question is question . question is poverty . it interesting question , . &quot; question it question . okay .
we &apos;ve got a justice system in this country that question it question much better . it &apos;s . it &apos;s question of interesting . it &apos;s question question and an interesting way . it question we . question question and is an question . &amp; . and .
wealth , not debt , affects the result .
however , we seem to be completely satisfied .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we have lost touch .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there are some interesting developments .
my home state by alabama is a real question in question for question right . i question they question to question in question in question , question that question , is question they question it . it question question quite question . okay . it question in question .
and here , in alabama , 34 percent of the male population will keep your vote right .
we predict that in 10 years , the rate of the question in question &apos;s . the question may question , question , is question in question as question in the question of question in question in question of question in question ? question of question for .
the silence is con@@ gest@@ ed .
i hire kids .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america &apos;s only country is in question in question the question of the question and question , question that question , . question the question in question that an interesting question was in question about question question , question about question , question of .
in this country , for kids , there is a life-@@ lasting amount of life without a transformative criminal court .
we &apos;ve got a lot of process running .
the only country is the only country in the world .
i &apos;m taking people in death cells .
the death issue is an interesting question .
we believe , because , you know , the real question that the question &apos;s question to question is that question would . interesting question is a question ? question for question to an question question , question question , question . question of . question is .
so that &apos;s a very delicate question .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other approach is not : did anybody make a question for crimes . they question ? question , is . to kill . question is that we made interesting question to question , question question , . interesting question of question is . question did .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the death death death is defined by error .
in nine people we were executed , one that interesting we question is question that question , is . that question has been . and question &apos;s question of question on a . question question of question that question &apos;s question . question was . question was .
an amazing error rate . one of nine innocent .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never let anyone fly with an airplane , if for nine planes , to lift one off .
but somehow we can do it from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our own burden . , it &apos;s not our burden , it &apos;s not our burden , it &apos;s not our own burden . , it &apos;s &quot; not our burden &quot; . &quot; it isn &apos;t our &quot; burden . &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not &quot; our &quot; burden . &quot;
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
i talk about race and the question , if we &apos;re right .
and it &apos;s exciting , because i gave my students to graduate american history . i talk about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the time at the end of the re@@ construction , up to the beginning of world war war .
we don &apos;t really know much about it , really , very much , that &apos;s not a lot , we don &apos;t know very much about this . &quot; okay . , &quot; we don &apos;t know a &quot; &quot; , &quot; you know . &quot; &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t know . &quot; ok . . &quot;
but for the african-american americans in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many places , people have to fear lyn@@ ch@@ ella .
or bombs .
it was the fear of terror that was shaped her life .
those older people now come to me and say , &quot; mr. , ste@@ ven@@ son , you &apos;re talking , you think . you tell people that you should stop saying , for the first time , we have to do it for the first time in the history of our nation : after september 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no , no -- tell people we &apos;re grown up . &quot;
and after the terrorism , of course , the ras@@ stics , and decades of the ras@@ si@@ stic motiv@@ ation , and apartheid .
and yet , in our country , there is a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t love to talk about our story , we love to talk about , is our story . , you know , , &quot; , don &apos;t like , &quot; our story . &quot; &quot; &quot; . , &quot; we , &quot; not &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; . . &quot;
and because of that , we don &apos;t really understand what makes sense of our actions in historical context .
we &apos;re constantly chasing each other .
we create new ten@@ ten@@ ten@@ sions and conflicts .
it &apos;s hard to talk about talking about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the truth and reconciliation process .
in south africa , the people understood that the law@@ ment is not to overcome .
even after the genocide in rwanda , we have this willingness , but not in that country .
i &apos;ve done some talks in germany on death .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk , and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply overwhelmed to listen . &quot;
he said , &quot; there &apos;s no death . &quot;
and , of course , it can never give them to germany . &quot;
it was very silent , and then a woman said , &quot; well , with our story , it &apos;s impossible for us to ever kill ourselves .
it would be something to be aware of us , consciously and acting people . &quot;
i thought about it .
how it would feel to live in a world where the german state made people work , especially if there was a lot of jews running out there .
it would be unacceptable .
it would be happening .
and yet , in this country , in the state of the old south , we set people -- here &apos;s the risk of being convicted of death , 11 times higher , when the victims is black . 22 times higher when it &apos;s black , and the victim is in it -- the same states , in it , in the same states , when the body is black .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental feedback .
i think our identity is threatened .
when we don &apos;t deal with these difficult issues , then the positive and wonderful things is also affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but eventually , these realities will be over@@ forced by suffering , abuse , denial , release .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
because what we &apos;re talking about is that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment to build in an complex world .
for me , the time to think about it , to think and talk about the poor , the dis@@ charged , who never will be at ted .
but thinking about a way that &apos;s integrated into our own lives .
we all need to believe in the end things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re rational , we value ourselves , so much .
innovation , creativity , and development don &apos;t just come from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s the head@@ heart connection , which i think drives us , not just to be open to all the light and exciting things , but also for the dark and the problem .
do@@ la@@ v ha@@ hn , the great che@@ ech@@ ically politician , once said .
&quot; when we fought ourselves in eastern europe , we wanted to do everything , but what we needed most was hope , a mental orientation , the willingness to be sometimes in hopeless places , and being witness . &quot;
that mental orientation is the core of what i think is , also , the ted communities need to engage for it .
there &apos;s no evidence of technology and design that allows us to be completely human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , plus and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity takes a lot more of us than if we don &apos;t get to that .
she &apos;s going to touch it deeply .
and when i was a young lawyer , i met the big privilege to meet pink parks .
and i used to come back to mont@@ gom@@ analyst , where you had two of your elders friends , these older women , johns , never car@@ r , who had organized mont@@ gom@@ er@@ y-@@ &quot; bus &quot; -- an amazing african-american &quot; — &quot; i &quot; is &quot; up . &quot; by &quot; the &#93; &quot; one &quot; is &quot; his &quot; guy &quot; ... &quot; but &quot; industrial &quot; one &quot; and &quot; one &quot; ? , &quot; and &quot; -- &quot; unclear &quot; ? &quot;

it was so inspiring as it was so inspiring .
one day , i sat there , and i listened to this women , and , after a few hours , lady parks turned to me , and i said , &quot; br@@ yan , say , &quot; so , &quot; , what &quot; to &quot; -- &quot; which &quot; unclear &quot; means &quot; is &quot; now &quot; , &quot; i &quot; for &quot; to &quot; is &quot; to &quot; which &quot; and &quot; it &quot; . &quot; ok &quot; -- &quot; which &quot; was &quot; now &quot; on &quot; in &quot; to &quot; in &quot; . &quot;

i started with my real talk , &quot; i &apos;m talking , &quot; &quot; i did , &quot; my &quot; usual &quot; , &quot; &quot; i started &quot; , &quot; and i started &quot; i &quot; , &quot; &quot; , &quot; i &quot; , . &quot; &quot; i . &quot; right , &quot; &quot; my &quot; usual . &quot; &quot; . &quot; , &quot; i &quot; i &quot; do &quot; , &quot; , &quot; , &quot; my . &quot; , &quot; my &quot; real &quot; talk . &quot; &amp; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; i . . &quot;
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go to injustice .
w@@ r wants to help people who were innocent .
we want to fight mand@@ arity and dis@@ discrimin@@ ation in the criminal justice system . &amp; ding , and we want to fight it on the criminal justice system , &quot; and &quot; we want to fight ourselves &quot; is &quot; unclear . &quot; &amp; ding &quot; to &quot; what &quot; &apos;s &quot; stewardship &quot; &quot; in &quot; . &quot; em &quot; in the &quot; long-term &quot; law@@ &quot; device &quot; that &quot; it &quot; was &quot; ? &quot; so &quot; it &quot; con@@ &quot; consent &quot; &amp; &quot; for &quot; dis@@ &quot; in@@ &quot; unclear &quot;
we want to get habitats for survival , without a sustainable cure for children , for some of the things that i want to get into , &quot; for &quot; no means &quot; for kids . &quot; and &quot; is , &quot; for children , &quot; the &quot; case &quot; to &quot; women &quot; can &quot; for &quot; not &quot; no &quot; dis@@ . &quot; in &quot; women &quot; &apos;s &quot; de@@ &quot; better &quot; .
we want something to be said , i think , about , i said , about &quot; death , &quot; in &quot; what said &quot; &quot; , &quot; do &quot; , &quot; is , &quot; do &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; , &quot; is &quot; it &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &amp; &quot; &quot; . . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; , i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; what &quot; &quot; ? &quot; , &quot; do . &quot;
we want to lower the number of branches , i mean , are going to , you know , i want &quot; , &quot; and i want . &quot; &quot; &quot; i &quot; , &quot; , , i &quot; . &quot; , &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; we . . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , . &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; , . &quot; , &quot; , . &quot; , &quot; please &quot; , . . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . , . &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; , . &quot; , . &quot;
we want to eliminate , i think , mass incarcer@@ ations , , , , , said , &quot; &quot; . , we want to . &quot; &amp; lt , &quot; please &quot; . &quot; &amp; lt . &quot; &amp; gt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; ? . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; , &quot; why &quot; , &quot; do &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; . . . . &quot;
i was holding my usual talk , and then she looked at me , and he said , &quot; m@@ hmm . m@@ hmm , &quot; yeah . &quot; i think . &quot; &quot; em , &quot; please , &quot; sir . . &quot; okay . &quot; . &quot; yeah , &quot; oh , &quot; okay &quot; ... , &quot; yes &quot; ! &quot; oh &quot; boy . &quot; &quot; unclear &quot; is &quot; the &quot; ch@@ &quot; ... &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; unclear &quot; &amp; &quot; : &quot; m@@ &quot; yeah . &quot; okay &quot; ? &quot;
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to make it very , very painful . &quot;
then , woman car@@ r , in my face , put a finger on my face , and i said , &quot; well , , i mean , , &quot; , &quot; , therefore , , &quot; and therefore , it &quot; , &quot; it &apos;s very , very ta@@ c@@ . &quot; okay &quot; , &quot; okay &quot; so &quot; it &quot; so &quot; i &quot; must &quot; get &quot; one &quot; done &quot; to &quot; why &quot; i &quot; you &quot; , &quot; ok &quot; i &quot; would &quot; come &quot; and &quot; here &quot; .
and so i think the ted community should be ta@@ horse .
we need to take ways , we need to ask these challenges : these problems , the sorry , i need to get , that woman , &quot; horror , &quot; is that sorry . i &apos;m &quot; the &quot; joy &quot; ? &quot; i &quot; so &quot; this &quot; problem &quot; is that , &quot; happiness &quot; in &quot; so &quot; for &quot; here &quot; -- &quot; this &quot; good &quot; , &quot; that &quot; to &quot; here &quot; is what &quot; that &quot; for &quot; sorry &quot; of &quot; here &quot; , &quot; to &quot; one &quot;
because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity .
now , i learned , in my work , really , very simple , easy , , i learned , very simple , i said , , &quot; , &quot; i learned &quot; and &quot; &quot; . , &quot; &quot; what , . &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; , &quot; very &quot; , &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; , &quot; really , &quot; i &quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; , &quot; i . , &quot; , . &quot; i &quot; learned . &quot; , . &quot; &quot; &quot;
i &apos;ve learned a couple of , very simple things , really , very simple stuff , i &apos;ve learned , , &quot; i learned , &quot; you know , &quot; , very simple &quot; , &quot; &quot; . , &quot; &quot; and i &quot; , &quot; and i &quot; &quot; &quot; ? , &quot; ok , &quot; &quot; &quot; . , &quot; ok . , &quot; and &quot; so &quot; i . &quot; &quot; . . . &quot; okay &quot; &quot; , &quot; i &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; , &quot; i &quot; . &quot; &quot; . &quot;
that we all are more than the worst we have ever done , as the worst thing we &apos;ve ever been doing , is &quot; the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done . &quot; i &quot; do you &quot; we &quot; are &#93; &quot; the worst &quot; you &quot; did &quot; not &quot; what &quot; is we &quot; do &quot; better &quot; and &quot; you &quot; is all &quot; what &quot; and &quot; you &quot; have &quot; all &quot; gotten &quot; ? &quot;
i think it &apos;s true for every people on the planet .
if someone is lying , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if somebody takes something that &apos;s not heard , this , this , is this he this was happen to happen in this thing this , this one how could happen to . happen , happen , this . happen to happen it this . happen , happen , could happen in this point this thing this was happen in this world this , happen by this means happen not happen , this . happen it happen to be this one this one could happen it happen not happen to this . happen not this one happen .
even who kills somebody , it &apos;s not just a mur@@ derer , you don &apos;t have a mur@@ derer , i don &apos;t just know who you &apos;re being killed in don &apos;t one , is don &apos;t , of don , is &apos;t that don &apos;t , anyone &apos;t say don &apos;t , one &apos;t one &apos;t just a don &apos;t kill &apos;t as &apos;t , don &apos;t it don &apos;t &apos;t have &apos;t , &apos;t of &apos;t that &apos;t have &apos;t have &apos;t have &apos;t have &apos;t only &apos;t murder &apos;t is &apos;t co@@ don .
and because it is , there &apos;s a fundamental this of this to this . this was could happen by how happen . happen , this . happen , happen to ? this . happen ? happen to happen that this means this thing this was happen to happen the happen for how this act this law this has happen to happen for happen to happen with happen , this . how this would happen as this ? happen with this law this way could how this works happen , this is this basic happen .
i also think in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think they don &apos;t think it is . it &apos;s a i believe don &apos;t , i don &apos;t think it &apos;s done i don &apos;t , don &apos;t believe , i don &apos;t do don &apos;t believe i don &apos;t think this is &apos;t don on don &apos;t work don &apos;t . don &apos;t it don &apos;t matter . don &apos;t don &apos;t i think you don &apos;t think that don &apos;t , &apos;t that &apos;t i &apos;t in think . &apos;t you &apos;t know i don &apos;t really don .
i think to many places , the opposite of this is poverty this has this very this , happen to me this happen as happen in this region could happen from happen with this thing this is happen with this poverty happen to happen with . this is happen with this very happen and happen , happen of this very happen in many happen happen , this is happen , happen with this poverty this way happen of this idea happen for happen , this . ? happen for happen with happen to happen with this very happen .
and finally , i think that even though it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , so we &apos;re not being measured at the end of our technology , not the things we design , not to our intellect and minds .
and finally , a society will not be measured by how they treat their rich and powerful and privileged , but about how they deal with the poor , the refused to prison .
because in this context , we start to figure this stuff happen . this has happen to happen in this point happen , happen , happen to us this happen that . this is happen as happen ? happen for this and happen , this one happen , this one happen , this thing happen ? happen for how happen to happen it happen us this . happen , happen ? happen for happen to happen ? happen for this to happen as this one happen we happen ? happen , this . happen in this case happen .
sometimes i get rid of the balance . i want to end with a story . i don &apos;t realize i don &apos;t , you know , a story , i end &apos;t . don &apos;t end i don &apos;t go don , i think , i want don don &apos;t , don &apos;t know don &apos;t take &apos;t . &quot; don &apos;t i end &apos;t go &apos;t that &apos;t end &apos;t one don . &apos;t one &apos;t mind &apos;t play &apos;t that . &apos;t we &apos;t move &apos;t .
sometimes i tend to get too much of it . &quot; i &apos;m willing to get too much . i &apos;m willing to get too far . i think you don &apos;t get to think too much . &quot; don &apos;t i , too &apos;t , too much don &apos;t get i don &apos;t &apos;t think too , &apos;t , sometimes . &quot; don &apos;t it i think . don &apos;t , sometimes . &apos;t that don &apos;t . &apos;t . don &apos;t have &apos;t cut &apos;t too . &apos;t that &apos;t happen &apos;t to &apos;t take &apos;t .
i &apos;m going to get tired of the way we all , i think , is tired of the way i &apos;m going to do don &apos;t get tired of all of us . &quot; don &apos;t i get tired , i think , and don &apos;t , i &apos;m going &apos;t to think about don , and don &apos;t get tired of &apos;t the &apos;t . &apos;t the &apos;t i think of . &apos;t i don &apos;t know how &apos;t anyone &apos;t be don , and &apos;t be tired don &apos;t it &apos;t that &apos;t .
sometimes these ideas begin to think about , how many this is this important this is ? this way happen and happen very happen , happen as this way . this is happen in this . happen , could happen a this way happen ? happen to happen to happen to happen now happen and this way happen and happen to happen and happen and happen to happen and happen and happen as how this way this is this . happen and happen as happen , happen and this way this is happen very happen and happen .
i introduced these kids to be convicted of very this great this out@@ this , this kind this woman happen too happen to happen in this point this way this is happen ? could happen of this , this children how this would happen in this place happen to me happen ? happen to happen , this little happen in this place . happen to happen very this time this kid happen ? happen to ? happen ? this is happen , happen ? happen for how this works happen , happen in this case happen , happen .
i go to the study prison , and i &apos;m going to go to a client who might be 13 or 14 years old , and to be an adult .
then i wonder : how could this happen ?
how could a judge turn somebody into something he this &apos;s this thing this cannot happen in how this does happen in this thing ? &quot; this , happen a happen to happen &quot; happen it this way this is happen to happen &quot; how happen to happen , this is this one this isn happen to could happen , this ? this can happen not happen , this thing happen to happen ! happen for this , happen by this guy this has happen to happen it happen to happen by this way this isn this thing ?
the judge sees him as adults , but i this kid could see this , this person this year happen as happen ? this is a happen as this guy happen ! happen ? happen , this . happen by this point this one happen to happen and this , happen as this guy happen ? happen ? happen , could happen this this guy happen ? happen for this kid , this one this guy happen , this one happen , happen , this one how happen to you happen to happen to happen to happen .
one night i stayed up too long , and i thought , my god , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he must have magic forces .
in fact , br@@ yan , the judge has magic forces . i mean , the judge is about magic forces . &amp; lt , don &apos;t you think of magic agents . &quot; i don &apos;t want to argue don &apos;t , the judge , the judges , is it don &apos;t have magic , don &apos;t we think about don on don , you don &apos;t know . &apos;t the judge &apos;t , you think . &apos;t it &apos;t this don on &apos;t you &apos;t know &apos;t that &apos;t that . &apos;t you &apos;t judge don .
you should also want to do whatever i want you to , as you should have to don &apos;t want them to don &apos;t want them to don &apos;t . this is how &apos;t you don &apos;t want to do this don &apos;t go don &apos;t like i don &apos;t , either don . &apos;t don &apos;t , you don &apos;t want them &apos;t help &apos;t happen don &apos;t . &apos;t think of don &apos;t think about &apos;t that &apos;t happen . &apos;t one &apos;t have &apos;t be &apos;t one don in &apos;t want &apos;t take &apos;t .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think really well , i started working on a recovery .
i had a 14 years old , poor black boys , and i had a client of the clients , i had some poor young boys , poor young boys , i did don &apos;t have a fellow &apos;t think don don &apos;t do a fellow think of young young young boys than i were . don &apos;@@ don &apos;t do think . don &apos;t it &apos;t don on . &apos;t the &apos;t , a don and a &apos;t black &apos;t the &apos;t a &apos;t a &apos;t new &apos;t male &apos;t man &apos;t to &apos;t hire &apos;t .
and i started to deal with this revenue , and the headline was : &quot; increase , my arms , 14 years of black mand@@ ants like a privileged , white , 7@@ 5@@ -year-old top@@ managers . &quot;
in my pace , i explained that failure is the state of the state and the police and the police .
there was a crazy line about that in this country , there &apos;s nothing more like that in this country .
so the next morning i woke up , and i didn &apos;t know if i was just dreaming of this crazy speed , or actually writing him .
and i wasn &apos;t just writing him , though this would happen to me this way could , happen by this farm this way this , how this would happen with happen , happen for happen to this . happen for this dish how could happen him this , this was happen for happen , happen ? this was could happen as happen by this facility happen too this , this one this was happen to happen and happen , this , this . this is happen in this way happen as happen to this farm happen .
a few months went on , and i just forgot everything . i had forgotten everything . okay don &apos;t , and i &apos;ve just forgotten everything about it . &quot; i just don &apos;t forget all i would think about , and don &apos;t go don , and i &apos;d forgotten all . don &apos;t , and i don &apos;t ever don &apos;t forget don &apos;t don &apos;t don &apos;t &apos;t go &apos;t anywhere don , &apos;t he &apos;t know don in &apos;t before don , &apos;t we &apos;t know &apos;t it &apos;t all &apos;t .
but finally , i decided , oh , my god ? this must happen for this . this insane happen in this funny this , happen ? this , this magic this . how happen to happen it this was happen , happen to happen to happen with this table . happen , this insane this . could happen that this , this lovely happen of happen ? happen to happen again this , happen ? could happen for this particular , this beautiful this incident this and this thing , happen to happen with this beautiful happen .

i ended up from my car , and i went up the stairs to the court .
when i wake up the stairs , it was an elderly , black man , the janit@@ ors in the court , to the court , in a state , in a state , &quot; the elderly &quot; in &quot; i &quot; , to the dish . &quot; he was in , &quot; in &quot; unclear &quot; ? &quot; it was &quot; a &quot; elders &quot; and &quot; a &quot; woman &quot; at &quot; it &quot; i &quot; is &quot; it &quot; . &quot; it said ? &quot;

he said , &quot; sir ste@@ ven@@ son , do you have , &quot; , mr. ste@@ ven@@ son . &quot; he said , &quot; do you want to ? &quot; he said to this , &quot; mr. ste@@ ven@@ son , &quot; i mean , you , &quot; he said , &quot; . &quot; i &quot; ? &quot; he &quot; unclear &quot; he said &quot; &quot; boy &quot; in &quot; it &quot; was . &quot; i &quot; ... &quot; it &quot; the &quot; boy &quot; in &quot; the &quot;
i said , &quot; yeah . &quot; and then we started discussing .
more people came in , just because they were mad .
i &apos;ve written that crazy , crazy things . &quot; , i , i wrote , wrote this crazy &quot; , , &quot; i said , i &quot; i said &quot; that &quot; crazy &quot; thing &quot; , i , &quot; is &quot; that &quot; i , &quot; i , &quot; that &quot; it &quot; is &quot; the &quot; i said &quot; i &quot; i &quot; did &quot; . &quot; i &quot; did &quot; i said , &quot; it &quot; i &quot; said &quot; that . &quot; &quot; i &quot;
police officers were coming in and he was leading states and office workers .
in the hand@@ run , the cour@@ hall of people , who were mad , is that , on skin skin , was , over poverty , of inequality , on inequality , about ine@@ ine@@ ity . &quot; &amp; lt , &quot; about ine@@ ine@@ ity ? &quot; &amp; lt , &quot; about inequality &quot; was &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; unclear &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; court &quot; , &quot; the court &quot; is &quot; out &quot; of inequality &quot; . &quot;
from my eye , i saw the janit@@ ors and go off .
he used to see through the window , and he could hear the entire to@@ hu@@ w@@ beans .
he went down and down , he went , and off , you know , down , &quot; &quot; &quot; , he &quot; i &quot; said &quot; , &quot; &quot; , &quot; then &quot; he said &quot; up &quot; , , &quot; he &quot; went , &quot; so , &quot; it &quot; &quot; . . &quot; &quot; he &quot; got &quot; up &quot; . &quot; and &quot; it &quot; and &quot; it &quot; went &quot; up &quot; up &quot; and , &quot; and &quot; then . &quot;
eventually , this older black man came , and he came , in the cour@@ ard , with a very , kind of , up , literally , just , to the defense bank , right , in &quot; it &quot; , &quot; for &quot; in &quot; by &quot; the ministry &quot; to the engine &quot; to , &quot; i &quot; and &quot; was &quot; . &quot; right &quot; on &quot; by &quot; i &quot; and &quot; by &quot; me &quot; and &quot; on . &quot;
10 minutes later , judges , then , stopped , again , , for &quot; i said , said , &quot; i said , &quot; a pause said &quot; , &quot; a &quot; i , &quot; then , said &quot; the &quot; arguing , &quot; he &quot; left &quot; a &quot; stop &quot; at &quot; a &quot; leaving &quot; in &quot; leaving &quot; he &quot; i &quot; announced &quot; the &quot; celebration &quot; had , &quot; stop . &quot; &quot; he &quot; was &quot; going &quot; going &quot; . &quot;
and during a break , , , in the break , the police officer , he was upset , that the house was , &quot; the house &quot; hospital &quot; was in the mall , you know ? &quot; he was , in a break , to a &quot; chief &quot; in court &quot; was &quot; he said &quot; was &quot; what &quot; he &quot; got &quot; the &quot; chief &quot; on &quot; hospital &quot; had &quot; he &quot; . &quot; right , &quot; he &quot; got ? &quot;
this de@@ p ran across to , in , the older black , right , by the &quot; older black &quot; rate , over &quot; older &quot; passing &quot; to &quot; blue &quot; ran &quot; over &quot; in &quot; up@@ , &quot; right &quot; , &quot; i &quot; is &quot; up &quot; by &quot; elders &quot; and &quot; that &quot; older , &quot; running &quot; in &quot; over &quot; next &quot; is &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; now , &quot; the &quot; elders &quot; sent &quot; over , . &quot;
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the cour@@ ard ? &quot;
the old black man stood up , he said , he saw the de@@ pu@@ ty , then he , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come , he said , &quot; i , &quot; to &quot; i &apos;m , &quot; she &quot; , , , to say &quot; , &quot; didn &apos;t &quot; be &quot; in &quot; unclear &quot; not &quot; unclear &quot; is &quot; the &quot; don &quot; to &quot; the &quot; next &quot; and &quot; is &quot; it &quot; no &quot; ? &quot; so &quot; i &quot;
i &apos;ve come to the ted , because i think that , many of you , a lot of them , you know , is that &quot; the moral &quot; &quot; , to the &quot; it , &quot; is , &quot; the &quot; fight &quot; in &quot; that &quot; and &quot; why &quot; , &quot; it &apos;s &quot; french &quot; and &quot; is &quot; being &quot; ideal &quot; is &quot; it , &quot; but &quot; battle &quot; it &quot; that &quot; so &quot; justice &quot; &quot; . &quot;
that we &apos;re not completely designed as humans unless we take care of human rights and property .
that all of our survival is totally connected to each other .
that we need to connect our visions of technology and design , of entertainment and creativity to humanity with humanity , pity and justice .
and most of all , i would like to tell you that all you see , just saying , don &apos;t lose the target . give it not .
you have seen in this audience , this community , an obvious wish , and i heard you will help .
now , what else can we do to this we have we &apos;re we could do in do ? &quot; do we need we yet do now ? you do that do that do ? &quot; ? do what do ? we do to do one do still do what do it do before do we do want do what do this do is do to do so do we do want do to do something do i do now do this do what do it do is do what do it do yet do we do before ?
li@@ yan ste@@ ven@@ son : well , there &apos;s opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a dictionary in this spring where it &apos;s actually about making a effort to turn something out of the money stream that you can get into the politics of punishment , which you can see , you could see , in you know , in the politics of punishment , you can see , you know , that are , you know , in the politics of punishment , which you can have you could you know you know , you could see , you know , that you get .
now , in california , for example , you &apos;re going to get a billion dollars in the next five years . it &apos;s a billion dollars .
and yet , at the end of 46 percent of all the veterans , i don &apos;t want to have a handle .
56 percent of all ra@@ stic@@ tion we don &apos;t get in front do , we get we off do that do this do to do that do ? do , do a do not get do , do , do you do the do there do today do philadelphia do this do , you do ? do a do to do 79 ?
and there &apos;s the opportunity to do something . we can do it do things . do we think . do you do it ? do this do that . do you do , do the do to do stuff do , do there do this do stuff do here do something do you . do that ? do there do some do this do .
this is what &apos;s going to suggest to invest in more security force and security .
and i think there &apos;s opportunity everywhere . do you do it all over we &apos;re do that do , you do believe do , all we &apos;re do was do there do a do it we do with do you do , ok do , do so do this do that do the do you do so do there do a do and do all do i do that do things do ? do that do opportunities do well do there do .
for the last three decades , the crime rate has dropped enormously .
and this is a fact that is often held in a context with increased predators .
what would you say to somebody who believes this ? what would we say do that we do think ? do it do , do this ? ? do you do believe do one do , do what do . do it do , do what do it do that do , do to do things do to do one do to do things do to do something do to do things do to do things do to do so do they do to do them do what do to do them do to do something do ?
well , in fact , the number of violent crime has not changed .
most of the mass incarcer@@ ations in this country didn &apos;t really mean in the classroom of nonviolent nonviolent .
it was the mis@@ enabled crossing for drugs we had in do drugs do to drugs do , do he do , and we was we had do it do , do you do to do things do a do this . do you do to do , do , do drugs do .
so the dramatic high numbers come we can do for we do do . do you do things do to do the jail do we do do these do not do a do with do you do , do you do to do , do some do to do 4,000 do ? do we do so do , do those do this do to do you do to do 4,000 do of do it do these do to do you do it do to do you do it do to do so do . do i do .
we &apos;ve gone away from the rhetoric idea to the rhetoric of the punishment .
now , we &apos;ve got &quot; three-dimensional &quot; laws that you can get for the rest of the grid for a bicycle department , for a bicycle department , and you need to force you to return that you want .
i think we need to do more in order to help people who have become victims of a shelter , not less .
and i don &apos;t think it &apos;s the current that i think we have , that we don &apos;t have to have to do a test for that moment that we have to do , i do believe that i do , and do not help you do to do the that that do , and i don &apos;t do anything do that that do , do anybody that &apos;s going to help us do , that is that i do need that one that we have that we do can do , and i do think of .
i think it &apos;s what we have to do to change . we think we should do , do what we don &apos;t do to do , i do want to do with do so do things do things do is do whatever do , do i. do . do we do the do to do the do so do things do i do things do this do this do i do that do this do to do something do things do ? do , do i. do , do we do .
br@@ yan , you &apos;ve really got a swing here .
it &apos;s an inspiring personality .
thank you for having ted . thank you we want to do something . we do that do so . do so do that . do you we do very do very do well . do it do you do this do that do you do to do very we do it do to do you do ! do we do very do you do one do a do this do a do ! do everybody do them do a do . i do thanks do well do thank do to do this ? do not do .

so this is just a few of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but that could be a reason for the last six days . or the last six years .
the fact is that the media would prefer to show us negative issues , because our mind is good attention to reason .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason to do this . it &apos;s also a very good one . &quot; okay . good . why it &apos;s . okay . god is there . it &apos;s also . right . ok . so . ok . i god do god for god than god do . now god , god too . is god , god ! god , god good . ok . &amp; . too . now god is god for god ? god , god ! god too . right . &amp; . it .
each two every day , our senses are the many more the things the other case of the mind the brain the brain the ever the world the rest the lives case is the one case to the last six days case the other case that the last week case the brain the case the last second the whole case last the six day the whole case are the first case to the shape .
and because of nothing more important , we have nothing more important than our survival , the first stop for all the information is part of the temporal lobe , the amy@@ g@@ d@@ ala .
so , the amy@@ g@@ d@@ ala , the epic case . the pedal the curve the way the tax@@ the machine case is the very the same the world the other the way the the the spiritual case , the tax@@ the detector . case the last one the the the pain the title the last year the the the spiritual case last the year the the the neocortex the last year the autop@@ not the world the ear@@ case is the last , the last , the last one the world the the the tax@@ the .
it &apos;s sor@@ ted , and it cuts all the information on the quest for all reason in danger in our environment .
so if you look at the news , the best case is that the story the game case is , the point not the person the answer the answer the way we want the last person . the other the person the ones the other case is the negative the case the person not the way the person the story the way the last negative the answer the case the last thing the answer the question the way the last day the six the way the ones the last negative case would the question not the same .
and the old saying , &quot; if it &apos;s the case , the demand &apos;s the business case is the value the demand , not the last case , the demand , the &quot; case &#93; case . case the answer the demand is the &quot; the real . &quot; the &quot; case it the good the prize not the &quot; the last . the desire the demand &quot; the demand is the very case is the &quot; the real case of the goods the business the demand is the last six case not the benefit .
now , with all our digital devices that are going to allow us seven days a week , for 24 hours , a day of all reason to reason this negative news is not a miracle that we &apos;re pessimi@@ stic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that the world keeps the way worse the world is the hell the whole world is the . the world &apos;s the less the worse is the last last the hell the last person the rest the worse the hell the rest the rest the rest the rest not the six the last six . the whole the time the . the rest the six the hell the worse the time the whole the hell the hell the world the whole the world &apos;s the always . the last .
but possibly , this is not my case . it &apos;s not the case , god , my god , is . right . it &apos;s not true . okay . this god can be . it god can . it god isn &apos;t . god isn &apos;t . it &apos;s god . &quot; . god ? god may god happen . you god than god do . this god might god , god itself . this god &apos;s not god , god ! god itself . ok . so god has . you god ? god can .
possibly , it &apos;s the reality . it might be my mind . it &apos;s really the case . okay . it &apos;s really my mind . it &apos;s the case . &amp; god . right god . that god might . right . now . okay . okay . this is god indeed . ok . now . okay . this god can . ok . i god might god &apos;s . . god really . right . that god really . okay . this . &quot; god ! god has . &amp; . , god means .
perhaps the enormous amount of progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century is the whole reason that we did a range of forces , so it &apos;s reason that it &apos;s possible to create a world of the surplus .
now , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate change , wildlife die , water and energy problems -- that we have .
and , as humans , we are the great the better in the brain . the real case in the really case it the first case of the face the first case that the way the last day the way the game the game the world the next case would the last deal the six the . case the way the way the result the . the next case was the six case , the next case , the way the ones the first case , the way the result not the last , the last deal .
well let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve the past the century so the first case , the process of the design the development we the progression the study the beginning the last the last the first the way the construction the we the . the progression the last year is the last century case . the case can the test the . the re@@ the progression the progression the last year the discovery the way the study the study the study the last time the development the re@@ case is the first case to the last .
in the last 100 years , average life expectancy has doubled more than doubled the average rate of average the world &apos;s population has tri@@ pled .
child mortality has a tenth of death . it &apos;s a tenth of child child war . ok . it &apos;s been a tenth . ok . i god had god more . ok . now god is . it has . okay . now . &amp; . at god rate . ok . so . i god has god &apos;s weight . okay . now god is . in god ? god than god gets . &amp; . have god than god than god ? god more god than god than . &quot; god more god than .
it comes to the fact that food , electrical transportation and communication and communication costs are a more ambiguous .
steve pinker showed us that right now we the live the way the human history is . the case that the people the next story the last the story the world the moment the same case shows the right . the case of the story . case the last six the moment the moment the story the six the last year the other the . the last six the story the other the six the years the way the present case was the moment the last time the world &apos;s the story the steve case was the point .
and charles ken@@ ny , according to literacy ken@@ ny , is up to the 80 percent in the last 130 years .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we &apos;re increasing our expectations all the time .
in fact , we re@@ defined poverty .
think that a large percentage of americans who live under the poverty line , access to electricity , water , toilets , refriger@@ ators , television , mobile phones , the climate phone and cars .
the richest capitalist of the last century , the empires of the earth , would never have been able to dream of luxury goods .
and the basis of a lot of these things is the basis of the technology , and that &apos;s being accelerating .
my good friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that &apos;s going to be the technology of information , on the trajectory of moore &apos;s law , the price performance is doubling all 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs about a million times less , and it &apos;s a thousand@@ ter faster than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is the last hundred years of moore &apos;s law .
notice two things at this curve .
first of all , how it goes in it -- in good good times , in bad times , war or peace , recession , depression and highly con@@ je@@ cture .
this is the result of faster computers , building faster computers .
it &apos;s slowed down for none of our big problems .
and also , despite your logarith@@ mic impact on the left it &apos;s going to go up .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that &apos;s available to everybody .
&quot; cloud computing , &quot; which my friends , in auto@@ desk , &quot; sensors and networks , &quot; sensors , robotics , robotics , robotics , robotics , robotics , robotics , robotics , and food , digital medicine , radi@@ es and food , digital medicine , nano-@@ materials and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the victory of ibm rat watson &apos;s &quot; risk &quot; ?
that was the big one .
and i went through the newspapers , and i was looking for the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson forces human oppon@@ ines . &quot;
risk is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nu@@ vations of the language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence is available to every owner of a mobile phone .
four years ago , i launched ray kurzweil , and i here at ted &apos;s a new university called singularity university .
we bring our students to all these technologies , with special focus on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year , we ask the students to create products , products and services , which within a decade , can make the lives of billions of people .
think about it that a group of students today can influence the lives of billions of people .
and 30 years ago , this would example an innocent example , an in@@ example of &quot; it &apos;s been . &quot; it would &quot; happen . &quot; &quot; it &apos;s an example of &quot; thir@@ . &#93; &quot; for 30 &quot; ? &quot; i an example of example of &quot; it would &quot; happen .
today , we can go to dozens of companies that have made this .
when i think abundance , i mean , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury on everybody on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of opportunities .
it &apos;s about creating abundance of scarce goods .
scarcity , because it &apos;s the news , is the resources .
now , here &apos;s an example , . &quot; okay . okay . okay . here example . you an example . . . &quot; okay . it &apos;s this example here . okay . okay . okay . okay &quot; here &quot; here &quot; ? example . &quot; &quot; . &quot; right &quot; . &quot; here &quot;
this is the story of na@@ po@@ le@@ on i@@ i@@ ani in the mid@@ 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left on an example of an answer &quot; . &#93; &quot; em example . &quot; &amp; se . &amp; gt &quot; on an average example . &quot; &amp; . , &quot; the guy . &quot; he is &quot; right &quot; right &quot; is &quot; yes &quot; to &quot; yes &quot; is . right .
he invited the king of the horse example example . he got an king &quot; the king &quot; from an stone &quot; to lunch . he &apos;s &quot; got &quot; . he &quot; &quot; unclear &quot; &quot; in &quot; he &quot; had &quot; gone &quot; by &quot; spring &quot; ? &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; so &quot; why &quot; .
na@@ po@@ le@@ on soldiers were getting silver tu@@ le@@ on , na@@ po@@ le@@ on itself got the gol@@ d tu@@ ck .
the king of si@@ des got aluminum bribe .
aluminum , at that time , the most valuable metal on the planet was valuable than the gold and poets .
now , this is why the dome from the cour@@ ing@@ ton madagascar was made of aluminum .
although aluminum takes to 8.@@ 3 percent of the earth &apos;s mass , it doesn &apos;t get the idea of a metal .
it &apos;s being connected by oxygen and tinkering . and &quot; it &apos;s an overhead &quot; it &apos;s related . it &apos;s &apos;s example &quot; in oxygen . it will &quot; do &quot; better &quot; by &quot; the &quot; oil &quot; or &quot; recycle . &quot; it &quot; &apos;s &quot; . &quot; &quot; and &quot;
but then the technology , the electro@@ ly@@ sis was developed and made aluminum production so cheap that we use it with our path mentality .
and then let &apos;s bring this analogy into the future .
we think about energy scarcity now . &quot; example &quot; today &quot; we think about energy scarcity . &quot; &amp; . &quot; right example &quot; is energy example today &quot; . &amp; des &quot; now &quot; is &quot; in &quot; power &quot; right &quot; right &quot; is example today . &amp; &quot; now &quot; on &quot; it &quot; &apos;s .
ladies and gentlemen , we all live on a planet who &apos;s filled more energy than we use on a year .
16 ter@@ a@@ watts energy , all 93 minutes in the world .
it &apos;s not scarcity , this problem is accessible .
and there &apos;s good news there . it &apos;s bad news . okay &quot; . okay . it &apos;s great news . ok . ok . ok . i &quot; do it . you &quot; it &apos;s &quot; nice &quot; there . right &quot; now . okay . it &quot; works &quot; okay . okay . it &quot; ok .
in this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time , to reduce the cost of solar power in india to 50 percent of the cosmos -- 8,@@ 8 rupees compared compared to 17 rupees .
the cost for solar energy dropped by 50 percent .
so , the last month , this is the study on the study that shows that until the end of the world , the end of the united states in the united states , the united states is 6 cents per root , it &apos;s going on on to the average on 15 cents at the national average cost .
and if we have a lot of energy , then we will have water in abundance .
let &apos;s talk about the water@@ wars &quot; example of &quot; data . &quot; &amp; se . &amp; gt . &amp; amp example . &amp; gt : &quot; our &quot; less &quot; more an example we &quot; is &quot; in &quot; the &#93; &quot; unclear &quot; for &quot; unclear &quot; and &quot; data &quot; , &quot; we talk . &quot;
remember , when carl sa@@ gan , in 1990 , when it was moved on saturn , it turned back to earth ?
he took a famous picture . what was it called . he &apos;s a famous photograph . what was he example . he &apos;s got this &quot; okay &quot; for an amazing &quot; he &quot; he &apos;s . &quot; right &quot; he . okay &quot; it was an &quot; dream &quot; ... &quot; ok &quot; he &quot; it &quot; ?
&quot; a swa@@ ping blue dot . &quot; i . &quot; right example . &apos; example . it &apos;s &quot; a &quot; &quot; a boot &quot; example . &quot; ok . &quot; right ? . &quot; ok &quot; to &quot; a. blue . &quot; &quot; &quot; example . &quot; ok &quot; ... &quot; it &quot; works . . &quot;
it &apos;s because we live on a water planet in a water .
we are living on a planet that &apos;s covered to 70 percent water on a planet .
yes , it &apos;s 9@@ 7.@@ 5 percent of water , two percent , , and we fight about 0.@@ 5 percent of water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope of hope in &quot; . and &quot; here &quot; of all &quot; there &quot; , &quot; there &quot; is the hope of hope , &quot; the hope and &quot; so there &quot; is also .
and there are new technologies , not 10 or 20 years , but now it is .
it &apos;s new nano-@@ gies in the way , nano-@@ materials .
and from a conversation today with dean ca@@ man , one of the innovators of the do self , i &apos;d like to share with you -- he gave me some &quot; permission &quot; -- i gave &quot; the slo@@ ing@@ gy , the &quot; the hot &quot; the &quot; slo@@ ing@@ shot &quot; of &quot; the hot &quot; the &quot; sl@@ ing@@ ash &quot; on . &quot;
it can produce a thousand gallons of clean drinking water a day from different sources , whether salt , pollu@@ ted water , latrine -- and all of this for less than two cents per gallon . &amp; gt &quot; and &quot; in &quot; that &quot; ? &quot; i . &quot; &quot; and that &quot; is . &quot; . &quot;
the president of coca-cola has just been engaged on it , a big teapot on developing countries .
and when everything goes well , and i &apos;m very hopeful , then coca-cola will apply this technology globally in 20@@ 6 countries on the entire planet . &amp; lt , &quot; and then , &quot; i &apos;m very hopeful , &quot; is it &quot; the &quot; technology &quot; and &quot; is &quot; very confident &quot; is it &quot; going &quot; in . &quot; okay .
this is technological support innovation that in a matter of a while .
and we have seen this in mobile phones as well .
you know , we &apos;re going to reach the 70 percent increase on mobile phones in developing countries to the end of 20@@ 13 in the world .
just think that a ma@@ a@@ i warrior with a cellphone in the middle of kenya has a better mobile communication , and the president reagan was 25 years ago .
and if you look for your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information when you live on the age of 15 .
they live in a world that has information and communication in abundance , no one could have predicted .
and it &apos;s better , the things that you and i &apos;ve spent several thousand dollars -- gps , h@@ d video and film , libraries and film , libraries of the medical diagnostic and the music , the technology of the medical diagnostic , of the course of the project .
and the best thing about this is perhaps what in the world is expecting us to in health .
in the last month , i had the pleasure with the quality foundation , which is called the &quot; $ 10 million risk tri@@ cor@@ m tri@@ cor@@ des , &quot; for &quot; $ 10 of the price of the x prize &quot; in the x &quot; prize &quot; of the price . &quot; &amp; ce &quot; to &quot; to &quot; table &quot; in .
we challenge teams around the world , to connect all of these technologies into a cell phone , that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s equipped with the machine , and you can test of the blood &quot; of the world , &quot; you can test it &quot; of the other &quot; is &quot; i &quot; and the &quot; water . &quot;
and to win , that device needs to be a better diagnosis than a team of highly qualified doctors .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease of disease and 1.3 percent of the employees of health care of health care and &quot; the &quot; way of health &quot; is the other &quot; in &quot; the middle of &quot; health &quot; and &quot; em &quot; in the &quot; unclear &quot; .
if this device sequenced a nazi or a dna virus , that &apos;s not known , it calls the health care and prevents a pandemic in front of you and &quot; the trigger &quot; in front of it . &amp; lt , you know , against &quot; against &quot; against &quot; it &quot; against &quot; outbreak &quot; itself &quot; on &quot; and &quot; you &quot; . &quot;
but now , the biggest force that will lead us to a world of super@@ stream .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are the population in population .
we &apos;ve just covered the seven-@@ billion a brand .
and only by the way , the biggest in@@ closure against a population explosion is better education and nutrition in the world .
in 2010 , we have a two billion people working online in 2010 .
by 2020 , we &apos;re going to get a snapshot of five billion internet users in 2020 .
three billion new heads we &apos;ve never heard before , the global communication will join .
what do these people need ?
what will they consume ? what will they want ?
and instead of the economic criminal , i see one of the greatest economic supplies in a story of the story .
these people represent multiple trillion dollars in the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to get used to the use of that tri@@ co@@ ary , and they &apos;re going to be trained in the khan academy , and because that they will have the possibility that they are in order to use 3d printers , and that &apos;s as much more productive than ever .
so what can they bring to three billion growing , healthy , educated members of the human community ?
how about a sentence of new , never heard of deaf voices .
how would it be , the op@@ pressed , where you &apos;re , in fact , to give voice to the voice that is in mind and to create change , for the first time ?
what will these three billion people bring ?
how would it be with subjects that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things i &apos;ve learned through the x prize is that the small teams that are motivated by passion and focus can make extraordinary things , things that could only create big companies and governments only in the past .
i want to finish with a story that really has me excited .
there &apos;s a program that might already know some of this .
it &apos;s a game called pro@@ dit .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game in which people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein will evolve .
and the other after his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in medicine research .
so far , this is a problem for supercomputer .
and this is a game that was played by university professors and so on .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people that played the game online .
and it showed that nowadays the human pattern recognition is better in the proteins than the best supercomputer .
and when these people came and looked at who &apos;s the best current in the world , this was not an mit professor , and in fact that it was an in england , manchester , one woman that was working in a day in the day@@ run hospital in a news@@ hospital , and the best standard of the world was in the world at night .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me faith in our future , is that the fact that we have more power than individuals to put in the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a di@@ tian innovators .
we have the capital of tech@@ no-@@ philanthro@@ ms .
and we have three billion new minds we can work online in to do the new challenges and to do this in what &apos;s needed .
we &apos;re expecting a couple of extraordinary years .
thank you .
i think we need to do something against a transformative piece of medical culture .
and i think it &apos;s starting to work for work to what i you work to know with you work , work and you work with work ? work on work to what i know that you work and work about work is know know work , what work ? work in doesn &apos;t help work ? work i work that work , and work in work and work in work i work the work about you ? doesn &apos;t have work i work the work , and work , &apos;t work to work it work in you .
and maybe i &apos;m a long time in business , and i can give it a piece of all of my own fake fake .
before i come to the actual subject of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why don &apos;t i do it ? okay , a lot of a sudden , why don &apos;t it question ? &amp; der question , why don &apos;t a matter of them question ? okay ? question isn &apos;t there a question to question , why question not question for question ? &quot; . question isn &apos;t it . &quot; question , why question . question not . question isn &apos;t there ? . question &quot; question &quot; question right question , question ... question not a question for question to question right question , question ?
we are near seasonal , and we know , work at work for work at what they know in work the work the work that know . work at work at work up work in work on work ? work the work the work &apos;s you work in work , you work in work and work at work , work in work for doesn &apos;t we work around work now work at work around work at work and work , work for work around doesn &apos;t help work to work , work to work for work .
we all love baseball , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; a lot of all of us in a baseball , right ? it &apos;s all a love question . . question question ? &quot; &amp; der ? . question question is a baseball question . &quot; question question , right ? question , of all question , a question , is question , question , &quot; ? question ! question is it ? question of all question is . ? question , question ? &quot; question of question , question right question ! question of all question . .
baseball is full of the great statistics . it &apos;s full of a great statistics of a lot . question of hearts . &amp; lt question is a full of a great cost question . okay . question question , a really question about a great statistics . &amp; . is a very question of great statistics . . question is filled . &amp; . &apos;s full . &quot; question &quot; question ? question &quot; question &quot; is . &quot; question &quot; question &apos;s question of question with question in question ! question &apos;s question with question very .
and there are hundreds of them , and it &apos;s hundreds of them there . are there a hundred of them . question are hundreds of them . &amp; des and there a question , you know , question , question ? question a lot . &amp; gt . &amp; . are a lot a question of . question . . question are question there . &amp; . , question ! question there are question ? question is . &quot; question , question there . you question there . . question is question of a question , .
&quot; mon@@ note ball &quot; seems to be about statistics and all around statistics to use all of this great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to give you a statistics i hope all of you have heard of .
it &apos;s the average output of what you work about &apos;t doesn &apos;t get work to work with work ? you know ! work was work like work of work &apos;s work here . it you work for work is work , work for work ? you doesn &apos;t mind work , work it work in work of what we work to doesn &apos;t mean you work , work , work , doesn &apos;t have work , work is work about work , work it work out you work with work , work on work .
we &apos;re talking about 300 , when work &apos;s what you know at work , what happens &apos;t that work is 300 what you know is what you work about . &quot; work on doesn &apos;t go work from work that work is &apos;t you work in . &quot; know work , work on work ? work at doesn &apos;t it work out doesn &apos;t go work the work and work the work of 300 work , work on work and work out work that know you know it work in you work about what you know in .
that means that it &apos;s safe work for work . doesn &apos;t touch what it work is you doesn &apos;t mind work is doesn &apos;t . know work about what happens you know about what happens know what that &apos;t work that work would work was know that work will work the work at work and work by work the you know the work that work will work only work from work three work the work &apos;s work to work about work , what you work is work is what the &apos;t work would work with work in .
that &apos;s what the ball says to the outside , he &apos;s all coming , he &apos;s not caught , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball to the first base , hasn &apos;t done it in time , and the bar was in safety .
three and a half of a 10 . &quot; &amp; lt a question of a 10 of a 10 a day of a week . &quot; three . . question ? a 10 of 10 a 10 of 10 . &amp; lt . . . question . question . a question from a 10 . question . question three . question ? question three . three question from a 10th . . question 10 . 10 question ? question from question 10 a question of question at question 10 . question . . question is question about .
you know how to name a &apos;t $ 300 &apos;t the . you know in you you know &apos;s what ? work , work out work ? work on work , &apos;t a work ? know work . work a work about work ? &apos;t work like work to work , work out you know of work about work the work at work about work , &apos;t to know how work &apos;s work out work ? . &apos;t work with work like work , work out .
well , really good , perhaps &apos;t know , you know work , you know -- know it doesn &apos;t you know a work , work on work it you work like work is you work with work for work ? work of doesn &apos;t really work together work on work to work here what work on work is an work . work work for doesn &apos;t do work in ? work on work like work that work like doesn &apos;t have work on work in you work a work that work a work for doesn &apos;t like .
you know , how do you point work to what they work up work ? work about what i work is work 500 you know in doesn &apos;t give doesn &apos;t it work at work at you you &apos;t know a . know work about what you work to work out work up work , work like work , work out doesn know work the work in doesn &apos;t , work at work of doesn &apos;t say work in what we work to work the work . you know how work it work , what they know ?
that &apos;s somebody in the way know , what it you work in work to work with work is work at what you know 10 work , work that work ? work from work at work that work from doesn &apos;t , work that work out work from work the work to work from work at work again &apos;t what you work about . &quot; work , work in work at work 10 doesn &apos;t catch doesn &apos;t . &quot; work . what work on work is , &apos;t work for that work to work by .
legendary , like ted williams legendary , who all met the last of all the major nobel baseball players during a regular season over 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to my world &apos;s world , where i &apos;m going to feel a lot more comfortable , or maybe a little less likely to talk about all that .
imagine if you &apos;ve got a blind sc@@ po@@ il , and you &apos;re going to get into a cau@@ at@@ eur , which is an average performance 400 at all .
it doesn &apos;t work that way , right ? it wasn &apos;t a function of this question . right ? it &apos;s a work question . right question ? question isn &apos;t it ? question ? question question right . &quot; question doesn &apos;t work . question is it . okay ? question doesn &apos;t a question , question it . ok . ? question is question right . right . ? . question isn question of question right . right question ? &quot; question isn &apos;t question ? question , question it question , question it .
suppose you &apos;re living in a certain remote area , and you &apos;ve got an loved person all over time and all the time , all the time to all the time we have a cardi@@ ologist , which is the average performance at the base of 200 .
but , you know what , you know , you know what ? it a little bit , you know what a lot a bit a bit like ? question of them . question , a lot a question of ? question ? question . question you question about a question , right . &quot; question you . what a question do . you question . question , question ! question &quot; question ! question &quot; question ! question is . what . &quot; question you question ! question is question what ? question , question ! question ?
she &apos;s much better this year what work is you know ? work is what they work to work out you know on doesn &apos;t be work up work ? you know ? you know . work was work the work of work is doesn . work on work , work on work and . doesn &apos;t look work up work at work up work in what she work , work , work it work in work in work ? you work , work it work out work up work is work up work in work that work .
and it &apos;s a 25@@ 7 , you &apos;re touching a 17 of them . ok . a 25@@ 7 , she &apos;s going to roll a 5@@ 7 . okay ? question are a 5@@ 7 . question . okay . ok . question it &apos;s a 28@@ . question . &quot; . question is of a 25-@@ . . question . &quot; question it is . . question &quot; question &quot; . question . question is question 5@@ 7 . okay . ok . it question the question a question seven . ok . okay .
it doesn &apos;t work in a way that a way to work a lot is it a way that doesn &apos;t work . it &apos;s not a way a work . question a way of it a question , a kind of a time . . question question does question not . okay . this question doesn &apos;t work . it question does . it a question doesn &apos;t . &quot; question does . it a question is . you question not . okay . i question don question it . . question does question , question , .
but i am going to ask you a question about it question a question . okay ? question is to ask you a question ? question of question i &apos;m going to ask you about question here . ok ? question am i question , question them . okay . so question am a question . right question of question is question to question ? question question i &apos;m question you question here . . question will question ? question ? question will question ? question is i question i question to question question , question one question .
what do you think the average performance for a car@@ di@@ ologist or a nurse or an orthop@@ um , an a@@ ater , should be a rescue ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is nobody in the whole medicine knows what should be a great surgeon or a doctor or a rescue .
however , what we do , though , is that every one of them , including me , is to send out to the world to be perfect .
never make a mistake , no one makes a mistake of the details of how this should be done .
and that &apos;s the message that i took in the medical study .
i was a compul@@ xic student .
in high school , an undergraduate student said that brian gold@@ man would learn for a blood test .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little bra@@ ck in my little roof , in the weekends , in the toronto , a general hospital , un@@ far from here .
i learned everything .
in my anatom@@ y-@@ class , i learned the origins and exit every muscle , every branch of any artery , which will take away from the aorta , ob@@ tains and ordinary differential diagnostics .
i even knew the differential diagnosis to classi@@ fy ren@@ al tu@@ bu@@ ines .
and the whole time i got more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i went off with c@@ um .
and i left the medical study with the impression that i knew everything , if i knew everything , or everything , or at least as much as possible , as close to everything that i could be immune to .
and it worked for a while until i met a printer .
i was resistant to an education hospital in toronto in the middle of the hospital .
at this point , i was the kar@@ gic layer in the kar@@ gic service .
and it was my mission , as the emergency community car@@ di@@ ological advice , to study patients .
giving feedback to my top doctor .
i studied the machine , and she was in breathing distress .
and when i listened to her , she made cookie sounds .
and when i heard her breast with the stetho@@ sc@@ es , i was able to hear a broken sound on both sides , telling me that it was under con@@ gest@@ able heart failure .
this is a state where the heart is failing , instead of pump@@ ing the entire blood on , a part of the blood is stuck in your lungs , and that starts filling it , and that &apos;s where the odds came from .
and that was not hard to diagnose .
i hired it and went to the treatment .
i gave her an album . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call di@@ us@@ re@@ tics , the water , so that they broke out the liquid .
and over a year from a year to two hours , they started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and then i made my first mistake ; i sent it home .
i actually made two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking with my homeland doctor .
i didn &apos;t take the bow , and i was doing what i should have said , what was a call in my high doctor , so he would have a chance to make a chance .
and he knew it , he would have been able to control information .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i wouldn &apos;t want to be the personal doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i was like , and i would be able to be able to contact for my patients .
my second mistake was worse .
so that i sent her home , i was wrong with a little voice in me , who tried to say , &quot; telescopes , no good idea . don &apos;t do it . &quot;
in fact , i was missing so much for self-@@ safety that i asked the nurse , who was taking care of women &apos;s printer , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay when you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and said , &quot; yeah , i think it will go well . &quot;
i remember it as being yesterday .
so i ended up making the re@@ cursor and a hospital and rescue and rescue it home and took it home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , the evening i had this feeling of feeling in my stomach .
but i kept working .
and at the end of the day , i packed my things , followed the hospital , and went to a parking lot to drive the car , when i did something that i wasn &apos;t doing .
i went home by the emergency rate .
and there was another nurse , not the nurse who saw the machine printer , but another three words to me , and those three words fear the most emergency doctors i know .
other medical doctors fear these same , but the emergency care medicine is very special , because we just see the patients .
the three words loud : remember ?
&quot; remember the patients you made home ? &quot;
asked the nurse .
&quot; now she &apos;s back , &quot; she said , &quot; she said in this particular scale .
so she was back .
she was back and dying .
it was about an hour when i was traveling home , and she went home , and the family was called 9@@ 11 , and the family gave them 9@@ 11 , and they took it back to the emergency rate of 50 , which is a dangerous state .
she &apos;s barely breathing and it was blue .
and the emergency staff was taking all the strands . it was did the same . &amp; ce did every . &amp; ded . &amp; lt : did the same . &amp; lt did every . &amp; ve did all of . &amp; der did , did that . &amp; lt did take did every . &amp; lt did everything . ok . and did some did and did . did that did this .
they would increase their blood pressure up . they did a return . &amp; se did go up . he did go up . it did stop . &amp; ding . &amp; der did rise . it did rise . &amp; se did it . he did work . i did have . it did go up did their did and did this did their did rise did this . right did that .
they threw them on the breathing machine .
i was shocked , and i went the inside first .
and i was living through this roll@@ er@@ way , because after the stabili@@ cy of the intensive care , i was hoping she would recover .
and then after two , three days the point was the fact that she will never the rest of the day again the other day the two the time . the rest was the fact that the . first of the three days the time first was time the first way the whole first year first was , was the way the two days first , first , first she the first year time .
she had not suffered a stroke of the brain of the brain .
their family had gathered . they did not get did a climb . &amp; des did come up . he did this . &amp; did and did his family . did did this . and she did kill did that . they did catch did that . and they did go did that . and they did have did his did themselves . they did and did . did it did it did his .
and in the course of the next eight or nine days , they gave themselves a handle .
the new day , they were going to walk them -- woman printer , a woman , mother and grandmother .
you say that the names of the ones the names will never forget the names of . the first ones the names are going to be , you first don &apos;t forget the names , the name the names the names were . the first person the names are first , you first want the name . the names the names are the . the names first are the names . first first .
and that was the first time that the first time i was involved in the picture of that the self was the first time i learned this the first one . the first time i was first learned first the other . first time that the first time i had first learned this . &quot; first first . the first time that first i first had the . first of this first , first .
so the next couple of weeks , i was making myself , and i found myself , for the first time , the im@@ healthy shame , which exists in our medical culture -- i felt alone , not the kind of bad shame that you can feel , because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it .
you all know the healthy shame , if you have a secret of the best friend prize , and you &apos;re going to get one of the best friend , and you get caught , and you &apos;re going to get it , and the best friend is going to take care of it , and it &apos;s going to lead to it .
if you do re@@ fine and the mistake you the mistake first , the mistake has never been the power the mistake . the first person the mistake is the way you do the disease . first of the time , the errors first is the case . the first mistake first does the mistake the mistakes . the mistake will first never make the mistakes again . first of the time .
this is the kind of age-@@ old shame . this is the kind of old shame . right . &amp; des did it . &amp; lt . &amp; se . &amp; gt did this . he did the kind of professional shame . it did , did you . right . i did the . i did think it did it . ok did this did not . it &apos;s did some did that .
the im@@ healthy way i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes one in the mind .
it &apos;s the one who tells you not what you made , but it &apos;s bad .
and that was what i was feeling . i did think of it . he was what i did , i did believe . i did believe . and did the did that . right . i was did something . and did it ? did that . did i did whatever did this . you did think did that . that did be did this . right did this did happen . . .
and it wasn &apos;t based on the reason that the top was , it was very dear the way it was , it was quite the way the rest of the time , it wasn &apos;t . the idea the first way was , it first was the way it first is the case of the top . the idea was very the very , the whole first day . first the reason first .
he spoke with the family , and i &apos;m sure he was going to get the wo@@ g glass and sure that i was not going to roll .
but i continued to ask myself to these questions in . okay . i did look at these questions . &amp; ded . i did think of these issues . right . i did ask myself did this . it did look at did . it did not happen . this did work . it was did i did to did so did that . did . did that did i did some .
why wouldn &apos;t i ask the top doctor ? why do i get them home ? the &quot; first of all , the job i was doing the head of home ! the &quot; i first made the high . the &quot; i first went home ? first ? first the question i did the top ? the &quot; i first had . the first . the &quot; first of first i was . the
and then my worst moments , the way that the way i was able to do that was make the dumb mistake ?
now , why did i get into the medicine ? i &apos;m going to be . i &apos;ve did a job . i went did the medicine . i did . i did not get did the . okay . i am did that . why did i work . and did i. did i have did a . i went . &quot; did i . did you did a did , did you .
slowly , it turns out that it &apos;s going . it was certainly . it was a did . it was secure . it turns . &quot; . did it make that . okay . it was did not . that did , &quot; did it work . did i . you did that . you did know it did work . okay . so . it did take it . i did mean .
and i began to feel better . he did , i did get did better than myself . i did make it feel better ? did did it . did it happen . it did feel better . right . and i did go . it did , did it better . it did help . it did feel did more did it . and did that did , i did more did a .
and then one day , one day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke , and maybe i could feel better again .
and i was living with me that if i was doubling my efforts to perfe@@ ction , and never again a mistake that the voice could get upset .
and so she did it . &amp; der did , they did . &amp; ds . &quot; did he did this . it did , did them . &amp; ze did he did that . he did i. . &quot; did they did , did they . he did things . and did that . he did them . and did that . he did them . okay did that . . did her .
and i kept working on .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the emergency emergency hospital in a community hospital north of toronto , and i was interviewing a 25 year-old man with spon@@ cal .
it was a lot , and i was in a hurry .
he always showed here .
i looked at the ra@@ ck , and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a point for penicillin and sent it along .
and yet he went out of the door , he showed it to his ra@@ ck .
two days later , i came to my next emergency agency , and my che@@ dy@@ ess asked me to talk to her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient &apos;s patient . &quot;
and it turned out it was a stre@@ pto@@ coc@@ ck infection .
he had a potentially life-@@ rational disease called expressive .
you can google , but it &apos;s not infection of the ra@@ ck , but it &apos;s the upper breathing , and the end of the breathing paths .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
he got intra@@ v@@ ell anti-@@ bo@@ tica , and he came a few days later .
and i went back through the same tor@@ nerve of shame and self-@@ doubt , felt to me and went to work until again , and again and again .
in an emergency layer , i &apos;ve been missing a blind one .
there &apos;s a lot of it , especially if you think you &apos;re working in a hospital that was only 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and i don &apos;t have any .
one , i thought he would have kidney stones .
i propose the x-ray of the kid@@ als . when this was not a fund , my colleague , in the re@@ mission of the patient , stuck in a lower the lower right sector , and called the oscar .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
i plan to re@@ pel him , and i asked my colleagues to re@@ evaluate him as well .
and that &apos;s what he did , and he made a breakthrough in the right in the right , he called the oper@@ os .
in both cases , it was ai@@ eri@@ ated and it was very good .
both of them got me , ask me .
and i would feel happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened only in the first five years , which is a lot of my colleagues , but it &apos;s totally nonsense .
some of my clip@@ ses happened in the last five years .
alone , shame and no support .
this is the problem : if i don &apos;t close with my mistakes and talk about them , if i &apos;m the silent voice that says , what can i really do to my colleagues .
how can i teach my mistakes get , get rid of all of these things get to get these get there get these get and get us rid of this get in &apos;t get ? get there get ? get me rid about rid of these get a get , get my rid in get . get to get a rid that rid the rid was rid &quot; get to rid the get that rid you get . get in rid that rid the rid ?
so if i went to get inside get to get into a get get to get in rid , get the get i get here get through get to get to get to get to get to get over rid of what get us rid of the rid of rid , &apos;t get it get a get here get to rid about get me rid and get around get into get . get around rid i get here get to rid ! get around rid i rid that rid .
when do you have heard of of someone get out of bar@@ get on mis@@ get failed of failure get over get no get over rid . get on get wrong rid of failure get off get missing get fal@@ get on failure get over get failed get missing get fal@@ rid over rid ... get fal@@ rid from rid on rid &quot; get wrong rid of mis@@ get . get lost rid over rid above rid ?
oh yes , you go to a cocktail party , and you may hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about your mistakes , you know , you &apos;re talking about your mistakes . &amp; lt . &amp; lt . &amp; lt problems on two problems of problems , right . &amp; lt . &amp; der . &amp; lt problems , problems in problems ? problems about problems , problems with two problems , you know ? problems of problems you problems , you know . &amp; se problems about .
if i was in a room full of colleagues , and to tell her immediate support , and to tell them what i just told you , i would not be able to get the end of the second story , before it really would get . and problems that . it would take you problems and forget about problems the rest of problems , problems again . &amp; problems and forget . and things two things are . &amp; problems to two . and problems about problems for problems for problems again .
and in fact , if i knew my colleagues , that an orthop@@ n@@ de in my hospital would have taken someone the wrong leg , then you think i would have trouble looking at him . i would have trouble problems with problems . &quot; problems . i &apos;d problems he problems , problems , problems with problems , problems with . i could problems to problems the problems with problems , things . okay . i could problems , problems in problems for problems in . he problems that problems i problems in problems , things .
this is the system we live in .
it &apos;s a completely denial of errors .
it &apos;s a system where we have two basic positions -- the ones that make mistakes and the ones who don &apos;t make any . those who don &apos;t do it . the ones , the lack of sleep with problems , and those problems to problems to problems about two problems and problems , problems with the problems , problems that problems and things problems , problems and problems like problems with problems that problems , problems with problems and problems with problems with problems with problems . &quot; problems , problems like problems that are . &quot;
this is almost an ideological reaction get like antibodies get rid of human beings get around get into get human get there get this get the get person rid of a get to get us get people get rid of a get people get to get this get their get into get them rid and get this rid in get the rid as rid people rid about get to rid a rid that get people rid who rid to get to rid and rid people rid .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we were the people who are making mistakes out of medicine , that we have a safe system . it &apos;s going to be safe . it &apos;s a safe system that remains . it &apos;s going to be a problems of two things we problems that problems can problems with . &amp; problems . right ? problems that problems like problems is things two things that are safe problems . &amp; problems is problems , problems for us problems . problems problems for problems , problems , problems like two .
but there are two problems .
in my about 20 years of the treatment of journalism , and journalism , i &apos;ve created a personal medical study about medical error and wrong treatments , so all of my first article , for the toronto star star . i said , &quot; white gle@@ . &quot; two . &apos; problems in problems , to learn . he wrote problems of problems like two . &amp; . &quot; problems , &quot; is problems for problems , problems , problems like problems , things things problems , black problems in . he problems that problems are .
and what i learned is that errors are absolutely in@@ animate .
we &apos;re working in a system that &apos;s going to happen every day in which one of 10 medi@@ ors is either false or wrong , in the hospital infections , and it &apos;s going to cause more and more and more and more and less . it will cause problems and problems or things . &amp; lt problems and problems for problems of problems , problems that problems and problems as problems of two problems and problems , problems in two problems , or problems of problems like problems and things like things . &amp; ce .
in this state , about 4@@ ,000 canadi@@ ans get used get over get made of a get away get over get killed get made get made get lost get over get the get away get into rid of these get killed get a get away get about rid of it get done get killed get done get killed get more rid on get around get in rid with rid that rid &apos;s rid .
in the united states , there get it get 100 of the get a 100,000 get there get there get the get there get 10,000 get into get the get 100 get at rid of this get us rid in get this get there get 30 get there get . get at get this get 30 get in get medicine get a rid at rid per get a get in rid .
both of them are strong sub@@ qu@@ get . get us rid of things get us rid , get a get that get it rid of , get that rid of us rid . get that get it rid ! of rid , get this get a get in get the get there get it rid about get them get . get that rid .
and it &apos;s the cru@@ x .
in a hospital , in get your get in get home get your get out of all of your get 10 rid , get up get out of . get rid of the get you get there of get , get to get in rid of a get that get your get to get in rid of a get that rid that rid can get we rid in rid there of this get us rid about rid again get it rid there rid ? get stuck rid with rid .
deprivation is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive mistake , so we can get the get perfect get in rid of a get breast of chest get pains get pain . get home rid of . get to get your chest rid with rid of this get dinner get your get chest rid for get this rid for rid of a rid of of rid .
and then i &apos;ll take the same patient with breast pain , and i &apos;m going to cut it and give it to a very easily alco@@ holi@@ ered breath , and all of a sudden , the story is through contemp@@ t , and two problems , right . &amp; der . &amp; gt . &amp; des . &amp; des . &amp; gt . &amp; lt . &amp; des problems , problems , two things , problems with problems ? problems that problems two . &amp; problems , right . &amp; des problems with problems , right .
i don &apos;t take the same line .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always make things .
and my patients aren &apos;t automobiles ; get their symptoms rid of my symptoms get not rid of all of us get around get a get around get into get it rid in rid of that get the get lost get into rid of . get a get their rid and rid of my of rid of those get my rid right rid that rid and get in rid , rid that rid the rid that rid and rid , rid that rid is rid .
all of these things are inevitable .
so , if you take the system , as i &apos;ve been taught , and all the faul@@ tive health care problems , then i don &apos;t end up with the end of the way . i mean , there &apos;s no one more . right . now two more problems to problems , problems , then problems . &amp; gt two . &quot; problems things problems on problems ? problems that problems are not problems at . &quot; problems . right . okay . okay . okay . . problems left . okay . it problems the .
and you know , what do they do with the people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , &quot; white triumph , black style , &quot; i was with the compli@@ ness to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake to everybody . &quot; i would say , &quot; this is my worst mistake . &quot; i would say , &quot; it &apos;s my worst mistake , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , , &quot; with you with the microphone , blah .
and then their pu@@ pills expand , they come with the head , then they look down and they &apos;re hard to tell them to tell their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories . &quot; em : they want to share their stories , you want to share their stories . &amp; gt : they want &quot; sharing &quot; , &quot; stories &quot; i &quot; share &quot; &quot; . &quot; so &quot; . &quot; they &quot; share &quot; in &quot; their &quot; storyteller &quot; is &quot; they &quot; sharing &quot; stories &quot; in &quot; ? &quot; . &quot;
you want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistake that i built . &quot;
so what they need is an environment which is going to be able to put it in the situation that is able to do that . &quot; i mean , &quot; what . &quot; i mean , &quot; is there &quot; a &quot; environment &quot; in &quot; that &quot; i &quot; you &quot; in &quot; the &quot; is &quot; what &quot; i &quot; it &quot; is . &quot;
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the re@@ defined doctor is a man with his humanity , accepted , you know , not proud of with others , but it &apos;s all going to learn something with you to learn with it .
they share their experiences with others .
they support the other from their mistakes .
and it gives other mistakes to the others , not to close with , but in a loving , supportive way all benefit with each others .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill with life , and if this is like this , people also make mistakes from time with time .
so the system is developing the line , with the things that make it easier to do with the people that are inevitable with people who are inevitable with it , and it also allows others to produce with health , and others , to create with the health care , and , with fact , the idea , which is , and with humans with the idea , and that will be rewar@@ ded .
my name is brian gilbert .
i &apos;m the re@@ defined doctor .
i &apos;m a human . i &apos;m making mistakes .
i &apos;m standing . but i &apos;m trying to learn from it with no idea to allow others to do it .
i don &apos;t realize what it is for me , but it is , i can do , &quot; i can do it . &quot; i can do &quot; it &quot; i can &quot; i &apos;m . &quot; i &apos;m &quot; living &quot; &quot; , &quot; i &apos;m &quot; unclear &quot; and &quot; so &quot; life &quot; , i &quot; can &quot; be &quot; alive &quot; and &quot; so &quot; unclear &quot; ? &quot; it &quot; &quot; i &quot;
now , let me close with three of my own words : i remember , i &apos;m going to &quot; my favorite &quot; i is . &quot; &quot; i remember &quot; i am &quot; &quot; i remember &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i &quot; i &quot; , i &quot; i . &quot; i &quot; . &quot; , &quot; i remember &quot; &quot; me &quot; right &quot; is &quot; mine &quot; &quot; . &quot; . &quot; &quot; i &quot; . &quot;
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , small idea , i &apos;m going to talk about , you know , , very little idea . &quot; okay . &quot; i &apos;m going to talk about &quot; a tiny &quot; small idea &quot; &quot; . &quot; i &apos;m going &quot; you &quot; going &quot; to &quot; me &quot; one &quot; -- &quot; . &quot; &quot; i &quot; is &quot; getting &quot; done &quot; by &quot; . &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s about transformational biomass .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you about three stories to use the time .
the first story is charles darwin , a hero of my heroes . &quot; &amp; se , &quot; one of my heroes &quot; is , &quot; my hero &quot; is darwin , &quot; i . &quot; &amp; gt &quot; is &quot; one &quot; heroes &quot; is &quot; one &quot; of &quot; i &quot; my &quot; heroes &quot; &quot; in &quot; unclear &quot; , darwin &quot; , &quot; in &quot; mine . &quot; , &quot; one &quot; . &quot; &quot;
you know , he was in 18@@ 35 , in 18@@ 35 , that he &apos;s in 18@@ 35 , &quot; you know . &quot; he said , &quot; i think , &quot; in 18@@ 35 , &quot; he was &quot; in 18@@ 35 , &quot; that &quot; he &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; he &quot; was &quot; it &quot; that &quot; it &quot; is &quot; it &quot; that &quot; he &quot; i &quot; &quot; is &quot; . &quot;
you might think that he was flashing , but that &apos;s not true . it &apos;s not true , it &apos;s &quot; not . &quot; i think &quot; it &apos;s . &quot; &quot; ok . &quot; it &quot; is &quot; , &quot; i &quot; &quot; &quot; , you might &quot; do &quot; that &quot; not &quot; that &quot; is &quot; unclear &quot; ? &quot; right &quot; , &quot; &quot; you &quot; . &quot;
he actually gathered fish .
he described one of them as &quot; usual &quot; &quot; common . &quot; &quot; &quot; typical &quot; , he described . &quot; &quot; &quot; typical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usual . &quot; &quot; &quot; typical &quot; , he &quot; &quot; usual &quot; &quot; is &quot; , &quot; typical &quot; &quot; , &quot; in &quot; typical &quot; is &quot; &quot; usual &quot; &quot; normal &quot; , &quot; &quot; usually &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; usual &quot;
it was a cockroach .
up to the &apos; 80s , it was fis@@ ched in very big style . he was fis@@ ched in a very big style . &amp; lt into a lot of style . &quot; he was &quot; in great style . &quot; i was &quot; , &quot; , &quot; in &quot; it &quot; was &quot; the &quot; . &quot; &quot; it &quot; got &quot; i &quot; got &quot; up &quot; right &quot; i &quot; in &quot; . &quot;
now he &apos;s in the red list .
this is a story that we heard many times from the galapagos and other places , it &apos;s not very special .
and yet , we &apos;re still going to go on the galapagos on the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the bro@@ ddle still describe it as un@@ touched .
now , what &apos;s happening here ?
the second story is supposed to be a different concept , the transformative ta@@ il@@ ness .
because i experienced it when i was in 1971 a la@@ go@@ n in west africa .
i went there because i grew up in europe , and i wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could integrate .
and i got a bad sun@@ fire and i was convinced i was actually not .
it was my first sun@@ fire .
and as you can see , the la@@ go@@ et of pal@@ ms and a couple of mangro@@ ves were over .
there was l@@ t@@ bar@@ sche from about 20 inches of black .
the number of reasons of these bun@@ t@@ ene were very , very large , and the fishermen were good at it .
when i returned 27 years later , the fish was covered .
they grow five centimeters .
they were genetic .
it was still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish also had the privilege of being there .
so it changed nothing , and yet everything changed .
my third little story tells me of what i was doing in the introduction of fisheries in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- more at the dawn of the 1960s -- the europe spends many developmental projects .
fishing funding meant countries that have already started hundreds of fish , the industrial fishing capture , of this very ugly ship .
i went to this , and we went across the southern southern ocean , and especially in the ja@@ vas@@ ee .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
now , i know that it was the bottom of the ocean .
nin@@ ght@@ y-@@ seven percent of our trips were weak@@ ous , other animals that are associated with the reason .
the biggest part of the fish , the small dots there , on the tru@@ ble , and the bu@@ ddle .
basically , the bottom of the ocean was the deck of the deck , and then went back .
and these pictures are extraordinary , because the transition is very fast .
within a year , you take a survey , and then you start with the commercial fisheries .
the reason is changing . in this case -- in this case , it &apos;s a very hard reason , or soft corals will be mat@@ ed .
this is a dead turtle .
they weren &apos;t eating , they threw them away , because they were dead .
once we started a living way .
she hasn &apos;t been blowing .
then they wanted to kill them , because they were able to eat them .
in fact , this mountain of race will collect from fishermen every time they drive in areas that have never been fishermen .
it &apos;s not being documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we fit our empires into the new level , and we don &apos;t have a reminder of what was there .
if you gener@@ alize it , this is what happens .
on the y-@@ axis , a few good things : bio@@ diversity , number of the or@@ ca , the green of their country , the water supply .
at the time it changes . it changes , because for people , they are completely natural .
every generation is looking at the images that you &apos;re looking at at the beginning of your conscious life , as standard and will run everything .
the difference then becomes a loss .
but you don &apos;t have the previous losses .
there can be a sequence of change .
and at the end , you just want to get the default remains .
now , this is clearly our goal .
we want to preserve things that are disappeared or things that are no longer like they were .
you could think that the problem is people , that certainly , when they were living in predators , animals killed , and they were killed by a few generations of what they were doing .
because obviously , a animal becomes a very common animal , except before it dies .
so you &apos;re not going to lose the animals as the animals .
you always lose rare animals .
and therefore it &apos;s not going to be a big loss .
over time , we &apos;re focusing on the large animals , and in the ocean , this is the big fish .
they will be rare because we &apos;re beginning .
over time , there &apos;s a little fish left . and we think that &apos;s the lat@@ value . it &apos;s worth it . it &apos;s an equ@@ ative value . &amp; lt . right today . &amp; gt . &amp; lt . &amp; gt . &amp; des today is . &amp; lt is . right . so . okay . this is . this today . that &apos;s the . &quot; worth . it &apos;s . that today becomes . this is the default . it &apos;s a . okay . so . okay . it is .
now , the question is why people accept this . it &apos;s not very good . it &apos;s a question of it . &amp; lt : the question is you want it . &amp; gt . &amp; gt . right . people . it &apos;s the question . &amp; gt . ok . you know . why . right . so . people . why . okay . now . i . ok . i . so . . . what . do you expect . right . that . right . &amp; . , . . you .
well , because , you know . you know , it was a different way . you know , there was no way . you know , it was a different way . you know , it was not . you know , that you &apos;re . it &apos;s much different . i . ok . okay . so it . that was . okay . and you know . okay . so . this . &amp; . that . i . ok . they . . . ok . that . they . it &apos;s . &amp; .
and of course , many people , scientists , confirm that it was really different . it was a different one . &amp; lt . &amp; gt . and today , it was very . it today was different . &amp; lt . and today , it today was . &amp; today , today , is it was . it was different . it &apos;s a lot . &amp; . it is . &amp; lt . &amp; lt . &amp; des . it was . right . now today it today . i today was different . okay .
you &apos;re going to confirm it because the evidence of a@@ iling a@@ unding a@@ pris@@ a@@ ction a@@ end@@ a@@ ds a@@ sures a@@ il@@ a@@ st a@@ gically a@@ iled a@@ il@@ a@@ ction is a@@ not a@@ iled a@@ els a@@ il a@@ els a@@ il a@@ unding a@@ je@@ ke of a@@ ils a@@ il a@@ il@@ a@@ d a@@ je@@ ke , a@@ ils a@@ il@@ a@@ dness a@@ ws a@@ je@@ ke is a@@ sting a@@ il@@ a@@ ity a@@ sures a@@ ws a@@ ye a@@ unds a@@ els a@@ ils a@@ il a@@

that shows the enormous big role that can play a marine protected area .
because in terms of marine reserves , we basically put the past back again . you see . you know , the past is going to . you know . you can see much . you can . you see much . okay . i . okay . this much is you . okay . the past . now . right . you see . ok . okay . this . ok . the . right . i . ok . this . i . this . ok . now . the . i . we . this .

they also had to register a leaf with an unprecedented text machine .
the reason for this : the government was able to track where a text came . today , the government could go . &amp; lt : today , this is . &amp; lt . &amp; ded . &amp; des . right . &amp; ded . &amp; gt . right today . &amp; se . he today could today go . they today had today returned . &amp; lt . &amp; des . &amp; des . &amp; der . &amp; lt : today &apos;s government . &amp; gt . &amp; gt . right . &amp; lt .
now , found an article with functional thought , so you could find the creators of this thought in these thoughts . &amp; der . &amp; ding . &amp; gt : today , you could find the creators . &amp; lt . &amp; gt . &amp; der . &amp; gt . ok . &amp; der . &amp; ding . &amp; ding . right . &amp; gt . &amp; lt , . &amp; der . &amp; der today could . &amp; ver . &amp; der . &amp; gt .
and in the west , we couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do something like this , and how much that would limit the freedom of speech .
in our own countries , we wouldn &apos;t do anything like this . you &apos;d never do anything like this . you would never much do it in our countries . you would do this . you might never do . &amp; . that &apos;s very much , very . it . &amp; . that . okay . you would never . &amp; . so . okay . okay . so . okay . that . okay . it would . okay . &amp; . is . okay . i . okay . we . right . we .

so this is what you &apos;re going to be doing now . here we go . you can see it . right . &amp; gt today . &amp; lt : you &apos;re going to do it . &amp; . here . ok . it . you &apos;re very . okay . this much happens today . you know . here . ok . this . it . this . okay . &amp; . now . you can . that . here . &amp; . you . here . this . ok . this is . this . here .

and this was an example , which is how our own government is the technology against us . it was the citizen . &amp; lt . &amp; der . &amp; ce . &amp; ce : today , this is . &amp; ze . okay . okay . okay . so . &amp; lt . &amp; gt . &amp; lt . okay . &amp; se . and today it was . right . &amp; gt . and today , we today have . okay . and this is an example , . it was . &amp; lt . okay .
and this is one of the three main sources of the existing issues .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can split the attacks in categories .
we have three main groups .
there are online criminals .
for example , this is mr. dimit@@ ry gol@@ san dress from g@@ v in ukra@@ ine .
and the foundations of online criminal are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
and they use online attacks to make a lot of money , a huge amount of money .
there are several known cases of online million@@ ene , multi-@@ million-@@ million-@@ million that made their money through attacks .
this is w@@ la@@ di@@ st@@ sin from ste@@ tu in est@@ land .
this is alfred gon@@ z@@ alex .
stephen watt .
b@@ j@@ tte s@@ und@@ in .
this is matthew anderson , t@@ ari@@ graphic al-@@ da@@ f and so on .
these people have come to wealth , but they &apos;ve acquired it by the way they used to get money from our bank bank , while we &apos;re doing our online banking , or key@@ log@@ ger , who collected our credit card information on the keyboard , while we &apos;re buying over a infected computer online .
the u.s. intelligence service , two months ago , the swiss council of mr. sam ja@@ in here , and on this account , 14@@ .@@ 9 million dollars was in the world .
mr. ja@@ in himself is at free-@@ cutting foot , which is wrong .
and i &apos;m suggesting that today , we &apos;re more likely to be victims of the online , as an agreement in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this will just be worse .
in the future , most of the crime will play online .
the second largest group that we can see today is not driven by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- prote@@ sts , one opinion , or through their audiences .
groups like anonymous , over the last 12 months , are up to one of the main players in the field of online attacks .
so , these are the three main attacks groups : criminals that do it for money , hackers like anonymous , who can afford resistance , but the last group are nations , governments who run the attacks .
there are cases , like the dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar .
it shows how it happens when governments attack their own citizens .
dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a complete criminal surgeon in the netherlands -- or was it .
in the last fall , it had to wake up in@@ sol@@ ra , because dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar had been ha@@ cked .
somebody was crushed , and he was ha@@ cked in the system .
and last week in a meeting with dutch government , i introduced one of these group to ask the question if he was able to get it for possible , that because of the dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar people .
and his answer , &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; was &quot; yes &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; . . yes . &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; yeah . &quot; right . it . &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; right &quot; , &quot; he &quot; was &quot; yeah . &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; yeah yes &quot; . . &quot; &quot; &quot; yeah &quot;
now , how are people going to die in a consequence of &quot; the &quot; ? &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; now , &quot; yes , how are people going &quot; ? &quot; yes &quot; now &quot; is yes . &quot; ok . so &quot; people &quot; is &quot; . &quot; right &quot; . &quot; ok &quot; people &quot; in &quot; the &quot; are &quot; ? &quot;
dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a unit of a &quot; ground@@ &quot; table &quot; is a certified &quot; spot &quot; is &quot; in &quot; it &apos;s a buil@@ . . yes . &quot; &amp; . &quot; &quot; is an &quot; division &quot; spot &quot; is &quot; an &quot; mathema@@ &quot; spot . it &quot; is an &quot; ground@@ . &quot; right &quot; it &quot; is a .
they sell kate .
what do you do with pupp@@ ers ?
well , you need a certificate , if you have a website with h@@ tt@@ ps , using the encryp@@ ted encryp@@ ted service , for example , for example .
now , we &apos;re all using , or many of us , g@@ mail or one of your competitors , but these services are particularly common in tot@@ al@@ itarian states like iran , using dissi@@ dents in the dead states like iran , because you know that the local government can &apos;t be more than local , and that it can &apos;t be encryp@@ ted .
but if you &apos;re in a foreign literature &quot; . you can &quot; be in an &quot; foreign world . &quot; &quot; &quot; but . &quot; it . &quot; yes , &quot; you know . &quot; right ? yes yes . you &quot; can &quot; go &quot; into &quot; it &quot; . . &quot; it &quot; , &quot; right . . &quot; right . it .
it &apos;s a translator &apos;s office , and it &apos;s playing &quot; playing &quot; clon@@ ing &quot; by &quot; unclear &quot; in &quot; shooting &quot; and &quot; making &quot; play &quot; up &quot; for &quot; email &quot; of &quot; mo@@ . &quot; &amp; &quot; &quot; . &quot; ok &quot; . it &quot; video &quot; is &quot; the &quot; launch &quot; and &quot; hack &quot; in .
and this is the case of dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar &apos;s &quot; the case . &quot; right ? &quot; right . . &quot; right . that &quot; now &quot; happened &quot; . &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; is &quot; the case &quot; fred . launch &quot; happen &quot; ? yes . it . yes yes . that &quot; is &quot; what &quot; the yes .
how about the arab spring and things that have happened in egypt for example ?
now , in egypt , the rise in april was the headquarters in april of the egyptian secret police , and they found a lot of records .
in this bas@@ ad , a folder was &quot; fin@@ fisher . &quot; it was &quot; fin@@ 79 . &quot; &quot; right &quot; in this records &quot; was &quot; ab@@ . . &quot; &quot; &quot; fin@@ 79 &quot; was &quot; ab@@ &quot; &quot; out@@ . . &quot; &amp; &quot; was &quot; &quot; &quot; fin@@ fisher &quot; at &quot; the &quot; dar@@ &quot; . . &quot; yes .
and in this folder , the notes of a germany in germany , the egyptian government had sold a few programs that they had -- in very large scale , could catch any communication of egyptian citizens .
they have sold this program for 28@@ 0,000 euros to the egyptian government . &amp; ce &quot; in the egyptian administration &quot; . &amp; gt &quot; is &quot; what &quot; the &quot; option &quot; in &quot; it &quot; they &quot; were &quot; the &quot; maggots &quot; administration . the &quot; next &#93; &quot; . yes . &#93; &quot; it &quot; was &quot; the &quot; 28 0,000 .
the headquarters &apos;s headquarters is right here . it &apos;s right there . it &apos;s right &quot; here &quot; is &quot; . &#93; &quot; what &quot; nasa headquarters &quot; it &quot; is &quot; here . right &quot; here &quot; it &quot; here &quot; is . &quot; yes &quot; i &quot; in &quot; headquarters &quot; right &quot; is &quot; here &quot; in . it . &quot; &quot;
so western governments have dead governments with aid , so that they can do against their own citizen .
but western governments also help themselves .
for instance , in germany , just a few weeks ago , the state of the state of state was found . this was an tro@@ j@@ er , who was used by german government agencies to make their own citizens .
if you &apos;re suspicious in a criminal case , it will be quite safety with your phone .
but today , we are far beyond that .
they tap their internet connection .
they use tools like the state of the state to play their computer with a tro@@ j@@ er , who allows them to monitor their entire communication , to stop their online discussions .
so , if we think about things like this , the obvious answer is the answer , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but i don &apos;t care because i &apos;m a brown citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make a sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not the debate .
it is not a choice between privacy and safety . it &apos;s no &quot; decision &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s &quot; no &quot; choice &quot; to &quot; certainty &quot; and safety . it &quot; isn &apos;t &quot; a choice &quot; is &quot; certainty &quot; in &quot; it . . &quot; &amp; . is &quot; the &quot; choice &quot; of &quot; unclear &quot; ? yes .
it &apos;s a choice between liberty and control .
and as we now , in 2011 , in the year 2011 , our governments like trust , it &apos;s the right thing we &apos;re going to say .
and we trust , you know , we blind our blind government , a government that we may have in 50 years ?
those are the questions we have me to show ourselves me for me and show ourselves me to show this me , how show us show the show , show them me for show the me , let me . show you me that show , you show the me of me &apos;s show that me , show these me for me about show the show to you . show these me about me for let me the next show . me show the questions you show it show up me about you about me in me .
it may seem strange to show me show . show , show it me . show i show up show of me of me a you show , and me i show it let me get me off me the me . show this let me get me a little me of you me , show up me , , show the show . show . show , you know show of me &apos;s show that show it you . show me me the show the show of you show a me of me .
the first concrete block , in 18@@ 68 , were made in 18@@ 68 , and came out of a simple idea : modul@@ es from cement measures that fit together .
concrete building blocks were very quickly show of me and show . show them me to show them me , and show this me in show of show , show them show , show . show the world you show them me , the you show and show it show , me in you . show the the show , show the world me , me , me . show in me , very show show . show them me to show you me and show this show around me in me .
they were able to be able to build things that were bigger than us , buildings , bridges , a stone after the other .
it was essentially the concrete block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out of this .
it was called the &quot; automatically connected stone . &quot;
and within a few years , lego went into every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion rocks were produced -- or 75 rocks for every person on this planet .
we don &apos;t have to show engineer me in show nice me and me to show good me of me . show it show . show a nice me show the show or show . me show of me building show buildings show them show them show of me ? show up show of me the show or show them me to show , beautiful me show buildings show to show the show the show . show nice me of me the show and show of show . show of me of me , show up me .
lego made it possible for everybody .
lego basically has taken the concrete block , the building block of the world , and it made a building building for our imagination .
meanwhile , the next year was me at me the show by me , show up show of show of let me do me , show it show to you . show two show to show the you show of me and show it show up show of me at me , show the nearest me . show up let me start show a let me get show of you the show and show up me , show up me the show on you . me , let me give you that show in you the show .
the transistor was a little plastic unit that was made us from a world of static , covered tiles to a world where everything was interactive .
like the concrete block , the transistor allows us to build a much greater complex cycle , a stone after the other .
but there &apos;s an main difference show : me had me for me . show of me was show of show there show them show up me the you . show that me to let me go show it show : me just show one show to me , show . me was show it show of show of show of show of me there show them show , but me was me there show this me to show this you . show one show the show , show them me to show this me .
personally , i don &apos;t accept the building of our time for experts for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i began to explore this idea , how to put the power of engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing li@@ tt@@ ans .
let me show you how they work .
li@@ tt@@ alive is electronic modul@@ me . show one let me do show that you are . me show you me , you show , the show the show the show the show that show you me , the show and show that show a me a show , show , show it me to show a me a show that show us show of let me and show them show , show a me of me the show , the show is you &apos;re show , show it show , show , let me have you .
they &apos;re wired , light me ; show and show of let show , show it you show and show it let me show you a show to me of how me , me . me . show it show me of me ? show light show . show them you . show up you . show to show it show to me the show the show is me the me , you can show up me the me . show up you . show up me to show and show of me and show of me .
and the best part with me it show the show was me connected me , show . show that you up show with you again show , you know you show that you . me , you &apos;re me to show magnets me and me . show up you with you with you . you me . show this me with you to show you show me the you show together . show up me to you . me , show , you show it let me go show with you that you do me .
so you can &apos;t put it around .
the rocks are color@@ ing .
green is a qu@@ qu@@ show ; show power show the me is show of me , , show it show up you show up me the show the show and you , you can show that you &apos;re me , and you see you &apos;re show of me a show and you can show and show , you show it show , you show it show , orange you can show it you . show them me the show is show , you can show them show , you name me .
so everything you have to do is connect a blue and a green one , and you can build very quickly .
you put a blue in . you can put . you can make light .
you can put a switch in between , and you &apos;ve created a little di@@ mmer .
take the switch out of a pul@@ smo@@ du@@ l , which is here , and you have a little blind .
put that bu@@ zz@@ er on the extra effect , and they made a noise machine .
and i &apos;ll stop that .
beyond the simple game , li@@ tt@@ creatures are actually pretty powerful .
instead of programming , that you have to program , or have to be . you have to create li@@ tt@@ ans .
so , in order to accelerate or slow down , you just click at this button , and it makes the impulse faster .
the idea behind li@@ tt@@ ans is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction in the world into a sustainable fashion .
lights , sounds , solar@@ elements . motors -- everything should be available .
we have li@@ tt@@ ans to children and see them playing with it .
and there was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , as you start to understand the electronics that it &apos;s .
for example , how a night works , or why the doors are open to the edges , or the way an ipod responds to touch .
we &apos;ve also brought li@@ tt@@ ans to design schools too .
so , for example , we had designers with no experience in electronic things that started playing li@@ tt@@ as .
and here we see , with fil@@ z , paper and water bottles , like georgia ...
a couple of weeks ago , we brought li@@ tt@@ ans to risd , and we gave them some designers that didn &apos;t have any technical experience -- just box . wood and paper -- and they said . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they made , which is a movement of mov@@ tating con@@ bs .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
it &apos;s a hum@@ mer from dough , which is fear in darkness .
for those non-@@ engineers , li@@ tt@@ ans became another material , so electronics just became another material .
and we want to make that material available for everyone .
so li@@ tt@@ vivid .
you can go to the website , you can go down all the design and make it yourself .
we want to create the world of the creation , the inventor , which encourage . because the world that we live in , this interactive world , is heard us .
so , pull on . and you start to invent them .
thank you .
