you know , one of the great girls in traveling , and one of the pleasure in the ethnic no@@ graphic research is to live with the people who can remember the old days , who can remember their past , still touch the wind , to touch them on the rain of glass , in the very subtle leaves of plants .
the idea that ja@@ gu@@ ar &apos;s still is going to travel beyond the milky way , or the importance of the earliest of the inuit of the inuit , or that the himalayas is still more important in the himalayas , or in the himalayas , that the buddhist is still the breath of the dhar@@ ma , which is , in the himalayas , a group of a group of discovery , and that &apos;s the idea that the world of a group of particular possibilities that we &apos;ve been able to do is to be able to
and of course , we &apos;re all sharing the same ada@@ c@@ ties .
we &apos;re all born . we get kids to the world .
we go through rituals .
we have to get rid of the loss of loss through death , and so it should not surprise us that we all singing , dancing and art .
but interesting is the unique sound of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
it &apos;s not a matter of whether it &apos;s about the punk in the forests of bor@@ ne@@ o , or the voo@@ do@@ o ac@@ oly@@ ths in haiti , or the warrior in the church desert in northern kenya , or the rebellion in the church of northern kenya , the cur@@ es in the state of northern kenya , or a mo@@ che@@ lic in the middle of the world , and it &apos;s happened in the middle of the world , everest , the go@@ o of the world .
all of these people teach us that there are still other breeding possibilities , other ways of thinking , other ways of guidance on earth .
and this is a picture that , if you think about it , can only fulfill hope .
together , the diverse cultures of the world form a network of spiritu@@ ic and cultural life that &apos;s going on the earth , and the idea of the earth is as important as the biological life grid that you know as a biosphere .
you can think of this cultural life grid as a ethnic space , and ethnic no@@ sphere can do it as the total sum of all thought and dreams , myth ideas , inspiration and blogs that have been generated by the human imagination since the beginning of consciousness .
the eth@@ no@@ sphere is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are , and what we &apos;re capable of as an astonishing known species .
and just like the biosphere was brought down , it happened with the eth@@ no@@ sphere -- only more speed .
a biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent or more of all species are going on , because it &apos;s just not true , and yet , this -- the apo@@ kal@@ tic premise on the region of biological diversity -- is not exactly what &apos;s known to us as the most optimistic case of the cultural diversity .
and the key indi@@ cator for this is extinction .
when everybody was born in this room , they were talked about 6,000 languages .
now , a language is not just the population of the vocabulary or a series of graphics .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a tool with the soul of a specific culture access to the physical world .
every language is like an ancient forest of the mind , a turning point , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and from these 6,000 languages today , as we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , that &apos;s not the half to the ears of children .
they &apos;re not taught a little bit more . that means , if nothing &apos;s done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what might be more lonely than being willing to be one of the last people &apos;s people who speak your language , not to have no possibility of the wisdom of the ancestors , or the hope of having children to expect ?
and yet , of course , this horrible destiny is actually going on on the earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , an elderly man dies and takes the last sil@@ bs of an old language to the grave .
and i know some of you say , &quot; it &apos;s not better ? &quot; the world wouldn &apos;t be a better place , if we &apos;re all going to speak one language ? &quot; and i said , &quot; well , leave this language in yor@@ uba . let &apos;s be a breath .
let &apos;s be co@@ gi . &quot;
and then suddenly you would see what it would be like if you couldn &apos;t speak their own language .
so i would like to take you in a way to a journey through the ethnic no@@ sphere , a short journey through the ethnic no@@ sphere to try to make them understand what was actually lost .
now , there are some of us who somehow forget that when i say &quot; different possibilities of his being , &quot; really different possibilities of the being .
so , for example , take this kid of the bar@@ as@@ ana in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the ana@@ kon@@ da , believe that they were exposed to the milky age of the world from saint snakes .
this is a people which is not unexpected between the colors blue and green , because the skies is the forest that people depend on .
you have a personal language , and you have an essay called the linguistic mono@@ gam@@ y , you have to marry someone who speaks to another language .
all this spreads in the myth@@ ological past , and the in@@ equivalent of these large houses , in which of the mis@@ met of six or seven languages , is that you never hear somebody learning a language .
you just hear , and you start talking .
or , one of the most intriguing tribes i &apos;ve ever lived with , the al@@ oran@@ i in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people who had been contact in 195@@ 8 peace .
in 1957 , five con@@ forms of life tried to record and made a strong mistake .
they threw the pictures of the air down from the air , which we would consider as a friendly gesture , and they forgot that those people from the rainforest had never seen anything .
they took these photographs out of the forest floor , trying to see behind the face or the character , didn &apos;t find anything and determined that this is business maps of the devil , and they killed the five mission@@ ary of the devil .
but the wa@@ oran@@ i didn &apos;t just kill the state with the spe@@ ar .
they went through each other .
fort@@ 54 percent of the deaths happened through sales .
we went back to the genetic ology eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we asked people to do something about it , they gave them something that was so old he died because of his age , and we killed him anyway .
but at the same time , they had a clear notion of forests that was amazing .
their hunters could smell the ur@@ ine of an animal from 40 steps away to which animal species of this one was .
in the early twenty years , i got a really amazing task , when my professor at harvard asked me , to go to haiti , and the secret societies , which were the foundation of the strength of du@@ vali@@ er and video sound ma@@ rage , and the poison that was used to make z@@ om@@ bies .
and , of course , to give a sense of meaning , of course , i had to know something about this remarkable belief of vo@@ dou@@ n , and voo@@ doo is no cult of the black magic .
in the contrary , it &apos;s a complex meta@@ physical world .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked them to count the big world of the world , what would they say ?
christi@@ an@@ ity , islam , buddh@@ ism , manifest@@ ism or whatever .
there &apos;s always an continent going on because the notion was that in sub-saharan africa , there was no religious belief , and of course , there was one , and voo@@ doo is just the surplus of this very profound religious thought that we had during the tragic diaspora .
but what voo@@ doo does so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living survivors of the spirits .
the spirits can be used by the big water , answers to the rhythm of the dance , to promote the soul of the living temporary , so that acute and a half of us is going to be a very rich moment for god .
and the voo@@ do@@ o@@ cs like to say , &quot; your white goes into church and talk about god .
we dance in the temple , and we become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed with the mind , what can you be doing ?
you see , this amazing demon@@ strations : voo@@ do@@ o ac@@ oly@@ ths , in a tran@@ ce@@ o state , the fire@@ end coal without com@@ tru@@ ding , an amazing illustration of the ability of the mind to influence the body so that it &apos;s going to take place when it comes to a state of extreme arousal .
now , from all the people i &apos;ve met , the ko@@ gi from the sierra ella of sierra nevada is in northern colom@@ bia , the most extraordinary .
offspring of the old tyran@@ ni@@ ni@@ ni@@ ni@@ ous civilization , which is the cour@@ bian coast of colom@@ bia , and in the consequence of deliber@@ ation , this people moved into an isolated volcanic massive massive , which rises to the redwood coast .
in a blood@@ set continent , these people were the only ones who have never been conqu@@ ered by the spani@@ ards .
until this day , they &apos;re governed by a ritual pri@@ es@@ thood , and the education education is very extraordinary .
the young ac@@ oly@@ ths are separated at the age of three and four years old from their families , and in a shade world of the fin@@ ster , in stone boats , burning in stone boats for 18 years .
and throughout this time , they &apos;re being brought culturally into the values of their society , values that make the claim that their prayers and their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- balance .
in the end of this amazing initi@@ ation , one day , you &apos;re going to go outside one day , and the first time in your life , at the age of 18 , you look at a sun@@ board , and in this crystal moment , you &apos;re going to see , you know , the most amazing moment of the first light , if the sun comes back and says , &quot; you see ? it &apos;s really what i &apos;m telling you .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you must protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers , and they say we are the younger brothers for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
and every time we think about ourselves and landscape , we would think about r@@ ous@@ se@@ au , and the old piece of the no@@ aky wild , which is in his simpli@@ fied idea , or the th@@ ore@@ au , and say , these people are more connected to nature than we are .
so , new@@ born is not senti@@ mental , you &apos;re still being used by the nostal@@ gia .
it doesn &apos;t remain a lot of space in the malaria of as@@ mat or the cold winds of tibet , but they have shaped a mysterious ni@@ m@@ bus of the earth , which is shaped by time and ritual a mysterious ni@@ m@@ bus of the earth , which is not based on the idea of being aware of it , but in a far-@@ subtle intuition , which is the idea that the earth can only exist , because it gets into the human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little kid comes out of the terminal , which is that the mountain is going to determine that the mountain is going to determine it , it will be a very different one , and a different relationship to the resource , and a different relationship to that resource , which is that a mountain is a bunch of rocks .
whether he &apos;s a place in place or a pile , it &apos;s irrelevant .
the interesting metaphor is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of british colum@@ bia , and i believed that these forests are there .
that took me to another person as my friends under the k@@ wa@@ ki@@ l , who believe that these forests are in the place of the place of hu@@ ku@@ k and the curved por@@ ges , and the canary of the world who live in the world of the world , identify them on their hair initi@@ ation .
now , if you start to think of the idea that these cultures can create different realities of realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i just took last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have heard , the most powerful psycho@@ u@@ at from the repertoire of the shah .
so , what ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca does so intriguing is not just the pharma@@ colo@@ gic potential , but its process . it &apos;s going to be made out of two different sources , and in the one hand , there &apos;s actually two different sources , which is , on the one hand , there &apos;s a lot of different sources , which is , in fact , with the leaves of the coffee of the coffee plants with the name of the &quot; psych@@ ot@@ ria . &quot;
this plant contains some very strong tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine , which is the serotonin , di@@ meth@@ yl tr@@ ot@@ tam@@ yp@@ a 5 and taxon@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ meth@@ v@@ tam@@ tam@@ s .
if you &apos;ve seen the y@@ one@@ st@@ i , as you &apos;ve seen this stuff , the substance that you create from different species also is taxon@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ meth@@ yp@@ s .
this powder , too , is sort of like being made out of a barrel of a piece of tissues , and it &apos;s covered by colorful paintings , and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it becomes no distor@@ tion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even got to my professor , richard evan sh@@ ul@@ te , the guy who has led the psy@@ che@@ deli@@ c ac@@ re@@ a to the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the 30-@@ year years , spoke to the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico , and in the moment where you feel the impact , you couldn &apos;t be there .
but the thing that happens with tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ins is that they can &apos;t be used , because in the human gut , , of course , the emergence of the enzyme is called mono@@ am@@ in-@@ oxi@@ d@@ ase .
they can only be used with a couple of other chemicals that the mao den@@ eds .
now , the amazing thing is that the be@@ quet@@ s that are in li@@ ane , ma@@ o-@@ guer@@ se@@ oren , are the kind of things that is necessary to power the tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine . so ask yourself .
how do these people get from a fl@@ ora of 8@@ 0,000 species of ad@@ vent plants , those two morph@@ ologically unrelated plants , which , if in this way , combined , create a kind of bio@@ chemical version , is so much bigger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great eu@@ p@@ hemis@@ m , trying and error , which seems to be meaningless .
but you ask americans to say , &quot; the plant speaks to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the co@@ fan , have 17 variations of ay@@ a@@ hu@@ ca , which you see all the way in the forest as a way .
and then you ask them to ask their taxon@@ omy , and they say , &quot; i thought , you know , the plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out you &apos;re going to take each one of the 17 vari@@ als in the entire moon , and you sing them in a different scale .
well , this doesn &apos;t give you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than land@@ ina .
well , the problem , the problem is that even those of us , the sympathy for the difficult position of being able to look at it as or@@ g@@ ini and color@@ ful , but you look at the past , while the real world , is continuing our world .
so , the fact is , you know , in the 20th century , in 300 years , it &apos;s not going to remember its wars or technical innovation , but rather than an era where we were against them and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on earth either to be active , and that &apos;s not the way that the problem is .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new living possibilities .
and the problem is not the technology .
the sargas@@ x-@@ americans stopped being less in sioux , when they were bent and arrow tasks when the americans stopped being americans when they were horse and horse cars .
not change and technology threaten the integrity of justice . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of the rule .
and wherever you see in the world , you &apos;re going to discover that these cultures are not confined to the set , and these are dynamic living peoples , and these are dynamic living peoples , which will go out of its existence in the middle of the south ocean , and it &apos;s going to go away from the capacity of the adaptation , and it &apos;s going to be in the middle of the world &apos;s capacity to go out of their capacity to the south chinese sea , which is , in fact , to get
or if we go to the mountains of tibet , where i do a lot of research , you will see the ugly face of the political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the physical extinction of people , is generally convicted of people , but the eth@@ no@@ cide , the destruction of the lifestyle of people , won &apos;t just be convicted , but it was celebrated as part of a development strategy .
and you can &apos;t understand the torture if you haven &apos;t experienced it at the bottom level .
i used to go back to a young colleague of ch@@ ash in mexico china in west china , from southeast tibet to l@@ has@@ a , and when i came to l@@ has@@ a , i saw the face behind the statistics of which you hear , and i saw the face of the statistics that had been destroyed in be@@ ki@@ y and du@@ ts .
the father of this young man was identified as a writer .
that meant he was immediately killed during the chinese invasion .
his uncle fl@@ ed with her hol@@ iness in the diaspora who brought people to nepal .
his mother was locked in , as punishment for -- to be wealthy for the crime .
he was beaten in the prison at age two and two years to hide under her sweet pond , because she couldn &apos;t live .
the sister that was doing this ta@@ cker was brought into an educational camp .
one day , she came out of a single band of ma@@ os , and it had to take it for seven years into a heavy job camp .
the suffering can be in@@ empowered , but the sedu@@ ce of people is something impossible .
and in the end , we &apos;re really standing on a choice . would we like to live in a mono@@ chro@@ matic world of the monsoon , or in a poly@@ chro@@ matic world of diversity ?
margaret me@@ ad , the great anthropologist said , before she died , it &apos;s her greatest fear , that , as we move towards a thread , we &apos;re moving towards the world , we &apos;re not only going to see the entire range of human imagination on an abandoned thinking , but that we would have to wake up one day , and we have forgotten one day .
and it &apos;s hum@@ bling to think that our species has been there for 60@@ 0,000 years .
the ne@@ oli@@ thic revolution that brought us to agriculture , and in this moment , the &quot; cult of the seed , &quot; the poetry of the bl@@ man sat through the pro@@ sa of the prime pri@@ es@@ thood and hierarchy , specialization and took -- just 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world , as we know it , is almost 300 years old .
now , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we have all the answers to the challenges we are in the following millennia .
if we ask these diverse world cultures after the meaning of humanity , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we will re@@ discover the possibility of what we are : people with full consciousness that &apos;s aware of the importance that all people and gardens have to be able to be able to flourish , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
this is a photograph that i took on the northern end of the ba@@ ffel islands , when i went to in@@ u@@ its hunting on the nar@@ bar@@ al hunt , and this man , colorful , told me a wonderful story of his grand@@ father .
the canadian government is not always very good at the inuit , and during the course of the year of the year , we were forced to pull in settlements .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
the family , the fear of his life , took all the weapons and all the tools .
now , you have to know that the inuit don &apos;t have fear of the cold . they used it to their advantage .
the tracks on the tracks were originally made out of fish , made in a hospital &apos;s skin .
the grandfather was not afraid of the man on the arctic night or the patent storm .
he hat@@ ched out , made his pants out of sea dog@@ ch@@ r@@ f , and he went down in his hand , and when the pressure started , he shaped it in the shape of a pie .
he mel@@ ded on the pages of the fer@@ po@@ po@@ si@@ te menu , and when it was completely frozen , he would get a dog .
he served the dog and he was improvis@@ ed , took the skeleton of the dog and improvis@@ ed a little bit of the dog &apos;s skeleton , and he would improvise a different dog , and he would get a different dog on the sink with the snow@@ load knife .
you can &apos;t do anything like this .
and in many ways , this is a symbol for the resistance of the inuit and all over the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit in april of the entire control of a field , which is bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new country and it &apos;s called av@@ sty .
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all of them .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state that can look for its citizens and can reach .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who traveled to this distant target of the earth to realize that they &apos;re not away at all .
they are the countries of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination that go back in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these kids , like the dreams of our own kids , are part of the geography of hope .
what we &apos;re doing at national geographic is that we think politicians will never achieve anything .
we think po@@ le@@ mi@@ k -- we believe that po@@ le@@ mi@@ k is not persu@@ asive , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website get 35 million channels every month .
15@@ 6 nations send our tv channel .
our magazines are read from millions .
and we &apos;re using a range of trips to the ethnic sphere where we take our audiences in places like these cultural wonders , that they &apos;re going to take away from the site of these cultural wonders , and , you know , you &apos;re going to think that the world is going to be able to make a difference in a really mul@@ ticul@@ tural plur@@ alist world , that the wisdom of all people can contribute to our well-being .
thank you .
what i first &apos;m going to show you , as fast as possible , is the fundamental work , a new technology that we &apos;re going to get microsoft to be part of a year just a year ago , and it &apos;s se@@ ad@@ ra@@ ra , and it &apos;s an environment where you can either be locally local or away with huge amounts of visual data .
we see many , many gi@@ gaby@@ tes of digital photographs here , which you get se@@ am@@ less and continuously , can re@@ arrange , in any way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at how big these collections are or how big the images are .
most of them are digital photographs of a camera , but this one , for example , is a scan of congress , and it &apos;s in a range of 300 me@@ thal@@ es .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing that can limit the capacity of a system like this is the number of pix@@ els on your screen at each moment . it has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of non-@@ play data .
this is b@@ thy house from di@@ ckens . every sp@@ old is a chapter .
to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not about a picture , we can do something like this to really show that this is a real representation of the healing and not a picture .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading a book book .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a realistic case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a piece .
and that gives you really the pleasure , and the good experience to read a real paper@@ copy of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of a medium with multiple scales .
we &apos;ve also done something on the corner of this particular segment of the guardian .
we designed a wrong ad with very high resolution , which is much higher than a normal ad , and we added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see here .
or other models , or even technical speci@@ cations .
and this really symboli@@ zes these ideas to get these limitations to the available place on the screen .
we hope that that doesn &apos;t mean a pop and other nonsense -- that should not be necessary .
of course , the mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t really want to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we &apos;re also contributing to this area .
but these are all streets in the united states .
up on the top of nasa , on the top of nasa .
let &apos;s take a look at something else .
this is even live on the internet . you can test it .
this is a project called photo@@ syn@@ th , which really connects two different technologies .
the one is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ car , and the other is a very good research on computer vision , which is by noah con@@ lier , a university student student students , under steve sil@@ tz in the u@@ w .
and rick s@@ ze@@ li@@ ski was done by microsoft research . a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by se@@ ad@@ ra@@ au .
you can see this , if we create these kinds of views where we can penetrate through images and make this experience of multiple resolution .
but the spatial panels of images is actually what matters .
the computer computer algorithms have taken these pictures together so that these images all have been done in the real space , where these pictures that were made all over the place nearby in the canadian rock@@ ies , you can see , you see , the elements of stabili@@ zed slides , or the equivalent of these things , and these things were all protected in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have time to show you other environments .
there are the ones that are much more spatial .
i would like to show one of the original data sets of no@@ no@@ th , and this is from an early prototype of photo@@ syn@@ th , where we first worked in the summer to show you what i think is really the pun@@ ch@@ line of this technology , which is photo@@ syn@@ d technology , and it &apos;s not necessarily as obvious as you look at the environments that we have on the website .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so forth .
this is a re@@ construction of the cathedral , which was just in the computer with images of flickr , and they &apos;re just going to be not@@ ed in a little bit in flickr , and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t-shirts and on the university of the school site , and so on , and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in shirts and so forth .
so this is all flickr images , and they &apos;re all in relation to each other in this way .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
you know , i never believed i will eventually work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the re@@ ception here .
you can see , you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of cameras : everything is , from the hand camera to professional slo@@ rs , a pretty large number of them that have been put together in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;m going to find some of the weird ones .
many of them are covered by faces , etc .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here it is .
this is actually a poster of not@@ re , which was just recorded .
we can shift from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with the social environment , and it will now collected data from all -- from all the collective stores of what it looks like -- and everything will be connected to each other .
all these pictures are connected to each other , and it creates something bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes from all the earth .
think of this as the sequel of the work of stephen law@@ ders in virtual earth .
and this is something that happens through the complexity that people use , and it &apos;s growing to the user for the user .
their own pictures will be done with meta@@ data , which has a different person .
and if somebody has done the effort and all of these sacred caps , and they share all of them , i &apos;m going to give you all , then , my picture of the for@@ re steam cathedral , and all of a sudden , i &apos;m going to use it to go into this space , and i can use it as a point of view , and i can use it as an origin of the scale of other people .
and of course , the side product of all of these are the immense virtual models of any interesting part of the earth that are not just through over@@ flight or satellite images and so on , but through collective memory .
thank you .
do i see it right ? is it allowing me to make your software that at a certain time , within the next few years , all the images that are used by someone in the world are actually being associated with each other ?
yeah . it doesn &apos;t make anything else .
if you want them to create hyper@@ links between the images .
and it does this because of the content in the images .
and this is really exciting , if you think about the amount of seman@@ tic information that many of these images have .
as you do a web search for pictures , where you put sentences and the text of the website contains a lot of information about what it is .
but what would it be like to connect to all your images ?
then the range of the seman@@ tic frontier , and the abundance that makes it make it happen , really enormous . it &apos;s a classic network effect .
bla@@ ise , that &apos;s really incredible . so congratu@@ lations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , the way i hope , in touch with other things that you &apos;ve already heard of , and i &apos;m going to try to make some connections , if you &apos;re not noticed .
i want to start with what i call official dog@@ ma .
the official dog@@ ma of what ?
the official belief of all western societies .
the official dog@@ ma works like this : if our goal is maximize of the common wealth of our citizens , it &apos;s all about the reduction of the individual .
the reason is that freedom is good at itself , valuable , meaning , an unprecedented premise for human beings .
if people have freedom , then each of us , for themselves , is to do things that will maximize our common value and no one has to decide for us .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom you have , and the more freedom you have , the more common you have .
this is , i think , so deep in our water supply , that it would not come to mind .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us modern progress .
this is my supermarket . not big .
i just want to say something about sal@@ at@@ d@@ ements .
there &apos;s 17@@ 5 d@@ res@@ s@@ ings in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the 10 different olive o@@ ils and 12 bal@@ ambi@@ i@@ v@@ v@@ v@@ v@@ v@@ v@@ v@@ v@@ v@@ v@@ v@@ ms that you could buy to make a large amount of your salad , in the unlikely case that none of the 17@@ 5 is in the store for them .
so that &apos;s what the supermarket is .
and then you go to the consumer electronics in order to put a stereo table -- speaker , c@@ d player , a cas@@ red player , radio , stronger . and in this one electronics , there &apos;s so many stereo .
we can put together 6.@@ 5 million different stereo facilities from the components that are being offered in this business .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
in other fields , the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , and you could have any phone shelter that you wanted to get by ma bell .
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
one consequence was that the telephone was never broken .
these days are over .
we have almost an infinite selection in telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite one is in the middle of the middle -- fur@@ 3 play@@ er@@ u , nasa ha@@ ha@@ tri@@ ca and cr@@ è@@ me br@@ tte l@@ é@@ e fac@@ kel .
and if you haven &apos;t seen this in your business yet , you can be sure you &apos;re going to get it soon .
and what it does is it makes people walk into business and ask this question .
now , do you know what the answer is ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a cellphone that doesn &apos;t too much .
in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying points , the same explosion of choice hit .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to a doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , we could do a , or we could make b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i want to do ? &quot;
the doctor says , a has these benefits and risks and b has the benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not it . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patients autonomy . &quot; it sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift of the burden of responsibility for making decisions of someone who knows something about the burden of responsibility for the gathering of someone who knows something -- is not the case -- to somebody who knows nothing , and it &apos;s not that much of the time .
it &apos;s an enormous marketing for people like you and me , that if you think about it , it doesn &apos;t make sense at all , because we don &apos;t buy it .
why do they adverti@@ se us when we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is , you expect to call us the doctor the next morning and ask to ask a change to the point .
something so profound like our identity is now a question of choice about how this slide should show .
we &apos;re not killing identity , we invent it .
and we &apos;re as much new as we want .
that means every day if you wake up the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time when the standard assumption was that almost everybody had one , and they were getting them as fast as they could , and then as fast as kids could get .
the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they were doing after that .
now it &apos;s all easy to have .
i teach them wonderful intelligent students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i did .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re engaged with other things , you ask yourself , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i get married now ?
should i marry ? should i have kids , or do a career ? &quot;
they &apos;re all questions .
and you &apos;re going to answer these questions regardless of whether this means all the tasks that i &apos;m trying to do and not get a good note in my class .
and in fact , you should do this . these are important questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl reveals light , with the technology that allows us to work every minute from every place on the planet -- up to the ultimate ol@@ ph hotel .
there &apos;s a corner , by the way , which i &apos;m not going to tell you about , which is the slow drama .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
so what it means is this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of making decisions , again and again and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can look at our kids playing football , and we have our mobile phone on a hip , and our blackberry on other hip , and our laptop probably on our lap .
and also , if you &apos;re all off , every minute in which we put our child in the mu@@ ples of a football game , we &apos;re going to ask , &quot; should i accept this call ?
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even though the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to be your experience of the football game of your child very different than it was .
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a matter of choice .
and the world that we lived in was like this .
so i want to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world that we have now looks like this .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to do bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
it &apos;s a more paradox@@ ical , it &apos;s a paradox@@ ical way to make it clear .
with so many options you can choose , people will get very hard to decide at all .
i &apos;m going to give you another dramatic example of this , a study of investing in voluntary age .
one woman in me had access to investing in investment records , the giant fon@@ d@@ society of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 investment fund who was doing the emplo@@ yer , took participation by two percent .
they provide 50 investment fund -- 10 percent less employees take part than they would only offer five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 investment fund that are available to choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide what to choose to pick it up tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , never comes .
you know , it &apos;s not just that people have to eat dog food , because they don &apos;t have enough money on the rest , because they don &apos;t have enough money on the passenger , it means that making decisions is so hard that they have great investment rates of their emplo@@ yer .
by not participation , they &apos;re spending up up to 5,000 dollars a year on the workforce who would have been happy to put their contribution .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
you want to make the decision really , really , when it &apos;s an infinity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment fund , or the wrong sal@@ at@@ lation .
so this is the effect . the other effect is that even if we get past the paralysis and make a decision , we end up with less content with the outcome of choice , as if we had the possibility to make ourselves less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is determined by the large array of sal@@ at@@ f , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and it &apos;s not perfect -- and it &apos;s just to imagine that you could have a different choice that would have been better . and what &apos;s happening is that you have a different choice that you could have done , and what happens is that it &apos;s a very good choice .
the more possibilities there is , the easier it is at all not to regret that is disap@@ pointing to the choice that you meet .
second , what economists call op@@ op@@ led costs .
dan gilbert made a big point in this morning by telling how much the way we evaluate things depends on what we compare .
well , if there &apos;s lots of alternatives to think about , it &apos;s just very attractive characteristics of alternatives that you end up with , that makes them less satisfied with the alternatives they chose .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yor@@ ds , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple on the ham@@ pt@@ ons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . you have everything for yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; &quot; damn &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everybody in my manhattan apartment is gone .
i could park directly before my home . &quot;
and he &apos;s spending two weeks from the thought that he &apos;s missed the possibility of having a great parking parking .
op@@ sexual costs reduce the happiness that we get through our choice , even when what we chose is fantastic .
and the more possibilities for choice , the more attractive characteristics of these choices are going to take account in the impact costs .
here &apos;s another example .
well , this cartoon is doing some .
it makes a statement about it now , and perhaps to do things about it .
but a key point that he &apos;s doing is always , whenever you choose for one thing , you don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and these other things may have many attractive qualities , and it will be what they &apos;re going to do less .
third : es@@ kal@@ ation of expectations .
this struck me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in which there was only jeans of a species , and they bought it , and they were bad , they were incredibly unpredictable , and if they had a long enough and a lot of them , they started feeling &quot; ok . &quot;
so , to buy new jeans after many years of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few jeans , here &apos;s my height . &quot;
and the sal@@ es@@ man said , &quot; do you want snake , easy or wide ?
do you want buttons or mystery ? stone or acid ?
do you want to get jeans with holes ?
you want to cut down the bottom , cookie , blah blah blah ... &quot; and so on .
my jaw was down , and after i told myself , &quot; i would like the way that used to be the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying to take all of these damn jeans , and i left the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best pas@@ send jeans i &apos;ve ever had .
i got it better . all of these choices made it better to have it better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it to myself .
the reason for me to feel worse , with all these available possibilities , my expectations for what a good few jeans is .
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations when there was only one way .
when they were born in 100 ways , they would be fine , one of them should be perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i was expected to do , and what i was expected to do was look at what i was expecting .
the adding possibilities in the lives of humans will inevitably increase the expectations that people have about how well these possibilities will be .
and this leads to less satisfaction with the results , even though the results are good .
no one in the world of marketing knows this , because if you would , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing here .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that once everything was worse than everything was worse than everything was worse , it was possible for people to make experiences that were a pleasant surprise .
today , in the world that we live in -- we &apos;re wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfe@@ ction as expectation -- the best for you to hope is as good as you would expect .
they &apos;re never going to be surprised , because their expectations , my expectations , are high .
the secret to happiness -- that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all got -- the secret to happiness are low expectations .
i want to say -- a quick autobio@@ graphic moment -- i &apos;m married with a woman , and it &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t leave .
but not always is a bad thing .
after all , a consequence of buying a bad seat of diarrhea , if it &apos;s just a way to buy , is that if you &apos;re im@@ satisfied , and you wonder why it &apos;s responsible , the answer is clear . what would you have done ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and you buy one that &apos;s disap@@ pointing , and you ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is , you know .
they could have done better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the window , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , when people make decisions , and even when the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed , they accused themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a significant thing -- not the only , but a significant pack of depression , and also suicide , is that people have learned that because their standards are so high , and then , if you have to explain these experiences themselves , you think it would be their fault .
and so the idea is that it &apos;s more likely to happen to us , objective , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official dog@@ ma , which is one that we all think of right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question , which is more selection than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow more choices than a choice .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed this period for a long time to make choice better .
now , as a rule -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a policy question , which is thinking about what &apos;s going on , what all of these choices allow in the developed societies , is the material .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of them , whose problem is not too big .
your problem is that you have too little .
so the things that i &apos;m talking about is a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and depressed is , steve levi@@ tt has told you yesterday about how those expensive and hard car seats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy that they don &apos;t help .
they even hurt .
they worry about that we are worse .
if something of the people of our society allow us to make decisions so much to the societies in which people would have a little choice , not just the lives of people , but our dignity will be improved .
economists call this a par@@ et@@ o threat .
income distribution is going to make it happen all better -- not just the poor -- because all of these big choices are pla@@ sting us .
finally , read this cartoon , and , you know , an evolved person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know it can be done in this gold@@ fish glass . &quot;
un@@ tested imagination , a very rigid view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
the more i thought about it , the more i came to the view that the fish knows something .
because the truth is that if you break the gold air glass , so everything is possible , you have no freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the gold@@ fish glass , so everything is possible , you reduce happiness .
they increase paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs an gold@@ fish glass .
this is almost more likely to limit security -- perhaps for the fish , definitely for us .
but the ab@@ han@@ den of an abstract gold@@ fish glass is a recipe for misery , and , i guess , catastrophe .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what that might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code into a new phase of biology by creating new lives and building new lives .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask significant questions .
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something i think many biologists have tried to understand and that on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different approaches to simplify it up to the minimal components .
we &apos;ve digitized nearly 20 years . when we sequenced the behavioral genome , the shift from the analog world of biology to the digital world of the computer .
now , we &apos;re trying to wonder whether we can regenerate or whether we can make new lives , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , you know , you know , the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to do it with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it at about a hundred genes from the 500 or something that are here .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , in comparison to our . trust me , that &apos;s easy , but if we all look at these genes that we can eliminate one after the other , it would be very unlikely to take that to a living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to go forward to this chromosome , actually , which allows us to vary the single components and make some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , so we can synthetic a chromosome ?
it allows chemistry to create these really large molecules , which has never been done before ?
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is just a piece of odd material , by the way .
our steps of adding life was exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code has been evolving very slowly , but our final point would be now on an exponential curve .
we started with it 15 years ago .
it actually took a few years ago with a bio@@ ethical review before we did the first experiments .
as it turns out , dna synthetic is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can create the little bits of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a de@@ generic process , so the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes happen .
so we had to design a new method with which we could put these little pieces together and fix the mistakes .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome ph@@ i x 17@@ 4 .
it &apos;s a small virus of bacteria .
we made small pieces , made a error error , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting stage came when we took this piece of in@@ engineered chemical and put it into a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were then released by the cells and went back and killed coli .
i &apos;ve been talking to the oil industry recently , and they said that this is the model of the day .
they laughed more than her .
so we think this is a situation in the software , actually , to build your hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build an entire bacterial chromosome . it &apos;s got more than 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code , so we thought , we &apos;re building it in cas@@ ets of the size of the virus , which is to understand what the single components of a living cell are .
design is the key , and if you start to start with digital information in the computer , these digital information really has to be mis@@ able .
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the error rate was a 10,000 base pairs .
we found , in fact , when we used to get the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
a part of the design is to create pieces for the 50 letters long , and the other 50 letters that have to get over and build smaller sub-@@ units to build these together .
we have unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built water@@ signals .
think about it : we have a four-@@ letter code : a , c , g and t .
the letters of these letters -- these letters encode about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
we just started writing .
some people were disappointed that there was no poetry .
we &apos;ve built the pieces so that we could just put them away with enzymes . there are enzymes that can repair that and again .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces of the five to seven letters , and they put them together to make these together at 24@@ ,@@ 000-@@ letter pieces to put them together , up to 7@@ 2,000 .
in each step , we put these pieces into it , so we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process , which you &apos;ll see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get to the point of auto@@ mation .
so , this looks like a basketball poster .
now , if we get to these really large pieces -- over 100,000 bases -- then they &apos;re not going to grow in e. coli , and they &apos;re all going to get rid of all the possibilities of modern molecular biology , and so we went to other mechanisms .
we knew from a mechanism of the hom@@ ologist of the hom@@ ologist that the biology uses to repair dna that can put pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of it . there &apos;s an organism called d@@ ein@@ o@@ coc@@ cus radio dur@@ st , which is the three million ra@@ ils of radiation .
you see in the upper field that his chromosome just drops apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything has been combined again as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
these organisms can be completely dry , they can even live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life exists in space and can move , looking for aquatic conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a shot of the molecule that we &apos;ve created by using these processes -- in fact , we &apos;ve been using guns mechanisms with the right design of the pieces , and we put them in it . yeast will automatically put it together .
this is not a electron microscopic recording it &apos;s a regular strand .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it with the light microscope .
these are footage over a period of six seconds .
this is the publication that we &apos;ve just done recently .
this is over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code . it &apos;s the largest molecule with defined structure ever created by humans .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
if we would print it to the size of 10 and without a distance , it would be 14 pages just to print this genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we turn it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated to cope with bacteria .
it &apos;s as easy as you &apos;re in eu@@ kar@@ y@@ on@@ s , as we &apos;re doing : you just take the nucleus out and you have another one in it , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about the clone .
in archae@@ bacteria , the chromosome is embedded into the cell , but recently we &apos;ve shown that you can do a complete transplant of a chromosome to another , and it can activate it .
we used to clean the chromosome of a micro@@ species . roughly , these two things are from each other as humans and mice , and we gave them some extra genes so that we could choose this chromosome , and we took it to the enzymes , and it was very amazing when we put it in a cell -- and it was very amazing when we put it in a cell .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that here is the end , but we &apos;ve tried to move a bit further .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we find all kinds of species here that have taken a second chromosome , or a third of some of where , every time thousands of characteristics in just one second to a species .
so people who think of evolution as a gene will have changed a lot of biology .
there are enzymes called the restri@@ ction@@ als , which are actually being called dna .
the chromosome in the cell has no ; the chromosomes that we &apos;ve added .
it was ex@@ pri@@ red in the cell , and the other chromosome di@@ pped it as a foreign material , and so we just ended up with a cell with a new chromosome .
it ruins blue because of the genes that we added .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of the species , and all the characteristics of a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given into the cell .
all the proteins changed , and when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;ve been doing .
it might sound like genom@@ ian al@@ chim@@ y , but we can do the software dna , changing things quite dramatically .
now , i argued that this is not the deadline -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i said that we might be able to create a new form of the cham@@ brian explosion in which there might be massive new species of wildlife based on this digital design .
why should we do this ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious about what we need .
we &apos;re about six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
in order to put it in my context , i was born in 194@@ 6 .
today , three people on this planet are on the planet in 194@@ 6 ; in 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , fresh and clean water , medicine , for 6.@@ 5 billion people .
it becomes a challenge for 9 employees .
we need about five billion tons of coal , 30 plus billions of barrels of oil . that &apos;s a hundred million barrels per day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 of this material landing in the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries around the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
the electric media industry had a dozen components , and look at the diversity that came out of it .
we &apos;re in first line to the boundaries of the biological reality and on those of us .
we have these sorts of technologies today because of these fast gharial techniques , to do what we call combin@@ atori@@ ian genetics .
we now have the opportunity to build a large robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
if you imagine making these 20 million different genes , or these processes to produce the topo@@ ents , or drugs new vaccines , we can actually change more molecular biology than the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s just like selection , and we can cheat with life , production of chemicals or fossil production production and so on .
this is a shot of effective design software that we &apos;re working on to actually sit down and design new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it &apos;s going to look . we know exactly what their genetic code will look like .
we &apos;re now focusing on the fourth generation .
they recently saw corn to ethanol , which is just a bad experiment .
we &apos;ve got sources of the two and third generation that will be relatively soon , that will have much higher sugar gaps , like oct@@ ents or different kinds of bu@@ tan@@ ol .
but , as we think , the only way we think about biology is a major impact without the cost of food , or the limitation of its availability , when we see co2 as a source , and that &apos;s why we work on cells .
and we think we will be the first generation of the fourth generation , and it &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of different ways .
this is a organism we described in 1996 .
it lives in the deep sea , about one-@@ and-a-half miles deep , almost boiling water temperatures .
it changes co2 in methane in using hydrogen as a source of energy .
we study whether we can use carbon co2 , which could just be made to production , convert the co2 into fuel to make this process .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we have really -- moder@@ ate goals like the total petro@@ chemical industry , right . if you don &apos;t want to do that at ted , where else ?
but in the same way , we &apos;re doing the same approach to the development of vaccine .
you &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year , and we have a dollar too little when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think this can be changed by making re@@ assembling vaccines .
this is how the future might be able to look at changing with changes today , and the evolutionary tree is accelerating with synthetic bacteria , arch@@ a@@ en , and perhaps eu@@ kar@@ y@@ on@@ s .
we are light years away from people . our goal is that we have an opportunity to survive long enough to be able to do that . thank you very much .
on the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain how the machine works .
so it &apos;s gone . and for all those those who weren &apos;t there at the time , the lhc is the biggest scientific experiment that ever became -- 27 miles across .
his job is to create the conditions that exist less than a billion@@ th of a second after the beginning of the universe -- and it was up to 600 million times in a second .
it &apos;s just breath@@ taking ambitious .
this is the machine underneath gen@@ f .
we take pictures of these mini-@@ big big giants in detectors .
i work on this . it &apos;s called an atlas detector -- 44 feet in the diameter , 22 meters in diameter .
this is a spectacular picture of the atlas in order to see the scale .
the last september of september last year , the machine was the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it takes place in the control of the control .
it &apos;s a picture of the first soft score , which all the way back to the lhc , then interacting with a part of the lhc to make a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture at september 10th , we knew that the machine is a great triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this created the biggest , or this , when someone went to the google page and found the front page .
it means we get a cultural impact next to the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine to do with these wires -- these golden wires here .
these wires are 13 thousand am@@ lets when the machine runs on high performance .
now , the engineers are going to look at you and say , &quot; no , don &apos;t do that . that &apos;s little wires . &quot;
you can afford that because , you know , if you get it very far , it will become called super@@ liers .
so in minus 2@@ 71 degrees , cooler than the space between the stars , these wires can maintain tension .
in one of the connections , between the billions of thousands of magnets in the lhc , there was a license loop .
and then , the wires , the wires , have seen less and 13@@ -@@ thousand people , suddenly made electric resistance .
this was the result .
now , all of this is even more impressive if you think the magnet weigh over 20 tons and move around about 30 inches .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnet .
and they had to remove what we also did .
we re@@ capit@@ tioned them , re@@ paired them .
they &apos;re now back on their way back .
by the end of march , the lhc will be able to function .
we &apos;re going to turn it to it , and we &apos;ll be able to collect the first data in june or july , and keep our journey on what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , in a way , the debate of accidents again is the value of science and engineering on such boundaries . it &apos;s easy to reject something like this .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard is the fact that we reach beyond our borders , the value of things is the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my closest words of a english scientist , hum@@ ph@@ rey da@@ vy , who , as i suspect , was defending the use of the use of the study of his peers , his instru@@ lt , he was michael far@@ a@@ day , his instru@@ mp , that there &apos;s no mystery to the development of the human mind , that there &apos;s no mystery to the development of the human mind , and that we have no new worlds . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my job , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , life-@@ long love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect this to change .
however , a little bit more personal in my life and my career is something that has brought me to this work completely .
now , this obvious event was that i recently wrote a book -- a biography called placebo foods , bust , love -- and that , unlike all my previous books , from some reason to the world , and have been a big mega-@@ event , the international name of the world .
the result is , i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to be treated , i &apos;m going to be treated .
seriously , i was serious .
for example , you &apos;re going to worry about me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re not going to get rid of this success ?
don &apos;t you have a fear that you &apos;re going to write their entire life and never create a book that cares anyone in the world ?
okay , that really makes it worthwhile .
however , it would be worse , if i don &apos;t remember that i was about 20 years ago , when i first told the first time i was a writer , i wanted to be writer with the same kind of anxiety response .
people said , do you have no fear of having no success ?
do you have no fear of telling you the humili@@ ation of one ?
don &apos;t you worry that you &apos;re going to go to your life , and you never come out of it , and you &apos;re going to die on a black house of space -- your mouth filled with the bitter ray of failure ?
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : explode .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i &apos;ve always had them .
and i have a lot more of the fear that no one would be able to do .
like algae -- and other terrible things .
but , when it comes to writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it , and i think , why ?
is that rational ?
is it logical that someone should be expected to do the job that he feels to do ?
and what &apos;s wrong with the creative enterprise , that it makes us insecure about the mutual state of mind -- in a way that other jobs don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemist , and i can remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist who was asked to be a chemist .
with your chemist , john , john -- how do you do it ?
it just didn &apos;t happen , you know ?
but in order to be fair -- the group of chemi@@ sts have not been able to get the reputation of alco@@ hi@@ ctive depressed people .
we seem to be writer , but not just the writer , but not just the writer , but the creative of all gene , seem to have that call , mentally immensely unstable .
everything you need to do is look at the bitter death numbers of really great minds from the 20th century , who died young and often died .
and even the ones who don &apos;t actually have sui@@ cide was actually being neglected by their talents .
norman ma@@ iler said shortly before his death in his last interview : explode every one of my books killed me a little further .
an extraordinary statement that you can make about your life .
but we don &apos;t even know , if we &apos;ve heard somebody like this , because we &apos;ve been familiar with something like this , because we &apos;ve been familiar with this kind of statements as long as we &apos;ve been doing , and that &apos;s sort of the idea that creativity and suffering is , of course , that creativity and suffering -- in the end of the board -- always leads to the sea .
the question that i want to leave you with here today is , is this the idea of all right ?
feel that ? because with just one centimeter away -- i feel that i don &apos;t think about that perception at all .
i think it &apos;s not .
and i think it &apos;s dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch how it &apos;s taken to the next century .
i think it &apos;s better when we encourage our great creative experiences .
and i definitely know that for me -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start , start to start , this dark path of ownership -- especially in the case that i just found in my career .
this is -- you see , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 working years in me .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything that i &apos;m going to write from the world is being driven by the world that came after the end success of my last book , right ?
i &apos;m going to say it , because we &apos;re now all kind of friends -- it &apos;s very likely that my greatest success is behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
that &apos;s the kind of thought that anyone can get to do at 9 o &apos;clock in the morning , to drink gin , and i don &apos;t want to .
i would prefer to do this work i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time of the reflection , i seem to say that i could continue writing , a kind of protective psychological constru@@ ct .
in a way , i have to find a way to write a certain distance in true distance between me and my very natural sense of how the reaction will be on the writing .
and in the past year , i &apos;ve been looking for models for doing this , i &apos;ve been looking at the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies in the past , trying to see if you &apos;ve been able to help to deal with the emotional risks that are related to creativity .
this quest me in the old greece , and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will close .
but in the old greece and rome , people don &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of divine kind of divine mind , which was out of a distant , unknown source of people -- from unnecessary , unknown reasons .
the greeks called this divine di@@ fu@@ al spirits of creativity .
from so@@ crates , he thought he would have thought he was going to have a paper who gave him no longer .
the roman@@ mer had the same idea , that kind of piece of body &apos;s creative mind was a serial genius .
this is great . the roman didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly clever individual .
they thought that a genius was this kind of magical divine creature , which was thought that it was literally in the walls of an artist studio -- sort of like do@@ bby , the domestic 11 -- who would come out and create the kind of work in the process of the work .
this is brilliant -- there it is , it &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological construct that protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew it was so worked , right ?
the artist of aging was protected in certain things , like , for example , too much nar@@ cis@@ is@@ sm , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you don &apos;t want to look at everything for you . everybody knew that you had this body genius that helped you .
if your work blew -- not completely your fault , right ?
everybody knew , your genius was something .
so people in the west have really been thinking about creativity a long time .
and then the renaissance and everything changed . we had this big idea . and this big idea : let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe -- across all the gods and mystery , and there &apos;s no room for my@@ stical creatures taking orders of divin@@ ity .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational human@@ ism , and people started to think that creativity was completely from their individual .
for the first time in history , people hear this genius , or this artist , a genius -- instead of having a genius .
i must tell you , i think it was a great mistake .
you know ? i think to allow a person to think , he &apos;s thinking , or she was like the vessel , like the basin and the essence , and the source of all divine , creative , unknown , infinite mystery to be a small amount of responsibility of human psyche .
it &apos;s like asking somebody to smile the sun .
and it turns out all the egos , and it makes all this un@@ easy expectations to success .
i think this success pressure has wiped out our artists for the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
perhaps to return to an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and mystery of creativity .
maybe not .
perhaps we can &apos;t let the thought of thinking well from 500 years of human@@ ism in an 18-@@ minute talk .
and there &apos;s certainly people in this audience who would have really celebrated scientific doubt on the notion of -- basically -- fe@@ en that people follow and fe@@ en@@ ad on their projects and so forth .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to suggest is why not ?
why not think that way ?
because it makes a lot as much sense as anything that i &apos;ve heard about when it was about explaining the absolutely insane cap@@ ity of the creative process .
a process that -- like everybody knows that it &apos;s ever trying to make something -- in other words , in other words , everyone here -- not always reasonable .
in fact , he can feel really accurate sometimes .
i &apos;ve been in a recent encounter recently , when i met the extraordinary american di@@ ter in ru@@ th stone , which is now about 90 , which was more di@@ qu@@ ed , and she told me that she was growing up in the temple virginia , and she said she was going to feel and hear about the landscape .
she would say it would be like an x-ray of air .
it would roll on the land .
she felt when it came , because it would bring the earth under their feet .
she knew that in a moment , she was able to do one , and that was -- in her words , it was like the bat .
she ran like the devil to the house as she was tracking by this poem , and it was simply because she had to get fast enough to get into a piece of paper and to get a pen in order to capture it through them , to capture and capture on the sheet .
in other paintings , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran and ran , but she did not get rid of the house , and she went through it , and she would move it around , and she would say it was going to go over land , and -- and she said , after another poet .
and then there were these moments -- the part i &apos;ll never forget -- she said that there were eye eyes in which they almost took it .
so , she goes to the house and look for the paper , and the poem goes through it , and it grabs a pen as it goes through it and then -- she said -- it was as if it was to reach with her other hand .
she kept the poem in his tail , and she pulled it back into her body , and she took it into the sheet of paper .
at this occasion , the poem came down and intact on the paper -- but backwards -- from the last word for the first .
now , when i heard that , i thought that i was messy -- that &apos;s just like my creative process .
it &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a star jelly . to work , i &apos;ve got to get up to the same time and i wake up , and i &apos;m going to wake up , and i &apos;m really uncomfortable .
but even in my mouth , i have this thing .
and i guess many of you have done that too .
even i had work , or ideas that came from a source through me through me that i really can &apos;t identify .
what &apos;s the thing ?
and how do we deal with it without losing our minds , but to keep ourselves in the contrary of intellectual health ?
for me , the best living example of how you can do this is the musician tom wa@@ its , i was allowed to interview him a magazine ago .
we were talking about this topic , and you know what ? most of the time in his life , tom was the embo@@ diment of the embarrassing modern artist , trying to make this un@@ controlled creative pulse that was living in it and to reach with them .
but then he became older and quiet , and he told me he was driving one day in los angeles in los angeles , and it changed everything .
he went at high speed when he &apos;s suddenly hearing a little patch of a melody , which , as opposed to inspiration , is often difficult for him , and he wants to do it . it &apos;s gorgeous . it &apos;s delicious , but he can &apos;t touch it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen ; he doesn &apos;t have a cas@@ ad .
so , he starts to rise to this old ground , like , for example , i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to be able to run this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t make it .
but instead of sitting in panic , he just stopped .
he left the whole thought , and he did something completely new .
he just looked in the sky , and he said , &quot; sh@@ sorry , can you see i drive cars ? &quot;
i look like i could just write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a more cheaper moment when i can take care of you .
if you don &apos;t , you have somebody else .
go and wave leon@@ ard cohen .
his whole process has changed afterwards .
not the work itself . it was always as dark as ever and ever .
but the process and the heavy one that surrounds it was , when he got the genius out of herself , where he was doing nothing in trouble , and he went back to where he was going to come . he realized that it had to be no intern@@ able , agoni@@ ding thing .
it could be an amazing , wonderful , bizarre , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the universal , obvious thing that wasn &apos;t quite tom .
when i heard this story , it also changed a bit of the way i worked , and it has saved me before .
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of the writing of trauma , bust , love of the two rock that we all fall in , when we go to something and it &apos;s not working . you start to think that it will be a disaster . that &apos;s the worst book ever written .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just get the project out .
but then i remembered how tom talked to the free-@@ sky , and i tried it .
so i took my view from the manuscript , and i was talking about the comment in a lower corner of the space .
i spoke , you know , you know , you know , you , and i know both , if this book isn &apos;t brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see , i &apos;ve got everything i &apos;ve got . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so , if you want to have better , you &apos;ve got to check it here and take your share .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , you know .
i &apos;m going to continue writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give up , i think , for my part of the jobs here today .
because ... in the end , it &apos;s like following , and in the end , in the deserts of north america , people in the desert north states have accum@@ bed people with holy dancers and made music that have been rejected hours -- to the dawn .
these strong were always great , because the dancers were professional , and they were fantastic .
but again , very rare , something special happened . one of the founders was actually over-@@ global .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know everybody in your life has seen such a performance .
it was as if the time was silent , and the dancer went through a way , and he did nothing different than he ever did before -- 1,000 nights before , but everything came together .
and suddenly , he no longer seemed more humane .
he was lit by inside and down from the inside , and everything lit through a divine fire .
as something happened then , people knew what was . they called it his name .
they put their hands together and they started singing : sis@@ al@@ lah , al@@ lah , al@@ lah , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
the interesting historic foot@@ note , when the mo@@ ine@@ ry southern spain came in , they took this practice , and the dis@@ language changed , in the course of the centuries of placebo calls , al@@ ó@@ é , al@@ ke-@@ mo@@ an@@ é , ol@@ é , ol@@ ó@@ mo@@ ff , which you still hear in styles and fl@@ en@@ co@@ dances .
if an editor in spain has done something in@@ capable of doing something like this : sis@@ al@@ lah , ol@@ é , ol@@ é , al@@ nes , great , bra@@ vo , of course , it &apos;s a glimpse of god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need this .
but , the tricky part , the next morning , when the dancer wake up itself and recognizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock at a tuesday -- and he &apos;s no longer a five-@@ bag of god .
he &apos;s just an aging toyota with painful k@@ w , and maybe he will never get back to those heights .
and maybe somebody will never call any of god &apos;s names when he turns , but what should he do with the rest of his life ?
it &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most painful correctness of a creative life .
but perhaps it doesn &apos;t have to be so full , if you didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence comes from them .
if you might think that they &apos;re a match -- from an unimaginable source of their lives that will be passed on somebody else when they &apos;re done .
when we start thinking about it , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and that &apos;s how i think about security in the past months , while i worked on the book , which will be soon -- as the dangerous , scary , well-@@ expected success .
what i have to say to myself , if i &apos;m going to get crazy about it , is not afraid .
it &apos;s not mu@@ wed .
just make your job .
it &apos;s still for your contribution , whatever it wants to be .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the stupid divine genius that &apos;s asked you to be in the side is deciding , for a brief moment , to show a piece of wonder with your effort , then guer@@ ol@@ é !
and if not , dance is your dance .
and guer@@ ol@@ é ! triumph for you .
i think , and i feel that we should teach that .
sop@@ ol@@ é ! for you , for yourself , just for that , just for you to have the mere human love and your sense of being there .
thank you .
thank you .
ol@@ é !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic ice , which for nearly three million years , had the size of the lower 48 states , which is 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t press enough enough the seriousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thick@@ ness of the ice .
in a sense , the arctic ice is the beating heart of our global climate system .
it grows in winter and shrinking in summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a time-@@ lapse of what &apos;s happened in the last 25 years .
the permanent ice is covered with red .
as you can see , it grows on the dark blue , this is the annual ice in winter , and it &apos;s shrinking in summer .
the so-called hot ice , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which comes out of the body .
it &apos;s going to be gone in 25 years from here .
this is a problem , because warming is the bottom of the frozen ground around the arctic ocean , where there &apos;s huge amounts of frozen carbon , which , if you blow up , will be made by microbes to methane .
compared to the entire amount of climate change in the atmosphere , that amount will double when we cross this critical point .
already today , in some shallow lakes , in alaska , methane is methane from itself .
professor kat@@ ey walter university at the university of alaska has traveled with another set of labor to another flat sea in the past winter .
wow !
it &apos;s fine . the question is , how will it get us .
and one reason is , this enormous heat tank from north .
this is a annual blood river .
but the volume is much bigger than ever before .
this is the kan@@ ger@@ lus@@ u river in southern greenland .
you know , if you want to know how the sea seas goes up through land ice , it goes into the ocean .
these rivers take a lot more .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest ice mass on the planet .
last month , researchers , the entire continent , had a negative ice footprint .
and the west antarctica , which showed over a few sub-@@ islands , is particularly strong .
this is 20 feet of sea height , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the third largest ice mass , you see the new lakes that were glaciers a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half their water water out of that melting water .
in the dish , this glacier is the clean water source for this city .
the water levels have been consistent .
but when it passes , the most fresh water will fall away .
there was a 40 percent reduction in california in california .
this is the memory basin .
and the predictions of how they read them is seriously .
this au@@ stro@@ ction in all the world leads to a dramatic rate of fire .
and the disasters all around the world have been in a really extraordinary place , and never increased before .
four times the last 30 years in the previous 30 years .
this is an entirely incomplete process .
if you look at this in historical context , you can see what it works .
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of co2 produced all 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day in the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific , from the american continent of west and to the individual sub@@ continent , where there &apos;s a dramatic decline of oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest one factor for global warming , deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the biggest problem .
the united states is one of the two largest pollu@@ ts , with china .
and the proposal was to build a lot of other coal factories .
but we &apos;re beginning to see a change .
these are the ones that were rejected in the last few years with some green alternatives that have been proposed .
pain is a political argument in our country .
and the ko@@ hl@@ ary and o@@ lin@@ ou@@ s have spent a quarter of a billion dollars last year to promote clean coal , which is a contradiction already .
this picture reminded me of something .
in the middle of the day , at home , at home , in tennessee , it was a billion tons of junk lamb .
you &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is the second largest waste of america .
this was around christmas .
one of the commercials of the hummingbird industry , in christmas , was this .
sha@@ sty the carbon man is a miracle , happy guy .
it &apos;s in skin and abundance in america , and it helps to grow our economy .
fro@@ sty , the hydro@@ man will be clean every day .
it &apos;s affordable and loving , and workers remain in peace and bread .
this is the source of most coal in the west virginia .
the most powerful min@@ workers is the head of mas@@ sey 2000 .
so let me tell you , al gore , nancy pel@@ o@@ si , harry rei@@ d , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate protection was called two campaigns .
this is one , part of you .
in the co@@ al@@ er@@ gia , we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
that &apos;s why we put it on the top line , a significant amount of money to spend a commercial action , to bring the truth on coal .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and also smells of it .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
let &apos;s leave that .
saudi coal , they &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean coal factory .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean carbon technology .
and yet the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , which is remarkable clean coal technology that you see here , changing everything .
look at it , this is the nowadays , clean coal technology .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red bar that all connects all of us is our dependence on carbon power products like dirty coal and foreign oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free us from this mis@@ able situation .
support america with 100 percent clean electricity within the next 10 years .
a plan of bringing america back to work to make us safer and help to stop the global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
support america . find out more .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a new supply of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence of old , dirty power of power that is cooking our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investment to create good paid jobs .
support america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want to get far , go . &quot;
we have to get far , and fast .
thank you .
i want to start asking you to go back to the time of your childhood when you were playing with stuff .
and as they realized how to take the hands out and move it out , the blade of light and move , they actually learned to think and solve the space of space .
the spatial thinking is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
so , as a computer scientist , inspired by the kind of our interaction with real objects -- with my peers pat@@ ti , and my colleague je@@ an@@ th@@ i , and my colleague je@@ an@@ th@@ i , i started to wonder , what if we could be using computers to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
the question was that we decided to study the answer to the answer and we developed si@@ thers .
in short , an si@@ ven@@ able is an interactive computer in the size of a cone .
you can move with your hand , you can perceive each other , you can grab your movements , and you have a screen and a radio receiver .
more importantly , they &apos;re physically , why you just want to build them , just to move your hands and access your hands .
and the si@@ ddle are an example of a new generation of aid for manipulation of digital data .
and if these tools will become the body and it &apos;s an awareness for your movement , you can see each other and perceive each other &apos;s enemies , then we can start with the exploration of new and entertaining interaction species .
i &apos;ll start with some simple examples .
and this si@@ ven@@ able is for the video re@@ composition , and if i put it in a direction , the video will run forward ; if i put it in the other direction , it goes backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other to each other .
so , if i put them side-by-side , that &apos;s their interest .
if you &apos;re in a straight line , you notice that , and you can get a bit nervous .
and they &apos;re also feeling their motions and their degrees .
it was an interesting consequence of the interactions we started to realize , we could apply everyday gestures to data , like color , how you do it with liqui@@ ds .
in this case , we have three si@@ thers of color , and i can use them , and i can use them to pour paint in the middle , where they &apos;re going to mix .
if we cut it over , we can get a little back .
also , there &apos;s also some nice possibilities in education , math or logic games , where we give people the possibility of the fast trial , and the results want to see the results immediately .
here i am ... this is a fibonacci episode that i &apos;m doing with a very simple program .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of sc@@ rab@@ ble and bo@@ g@@ gle .
and basically , you get every round of every item on every si@@ ve@@ able show of letters , and as you try to form words , you &apos;re going to test it over a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , mixed again , and you have a new letter combination and new possibilities .
thank you .
these are some kids who came in a trip to the media lab , and i could move it , try it and take a video of it .
they really loved it .
one interesting thing about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give the people many instructions .
all you have to say is &quot; create words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here are a few people who test it .
this is our youngest be@@ s on the bottom right .
it turns out he was just wanting to stack the si@@ ddle .
so for him , they were just building .
this is an interactive scaffolding .
we wanted to develop an educational tool for linguistic learning .
this is fe@@ li@@ x .
he can bring new characters into the scene by pulling the si@@ ddle from the table that shows this character .
here he gets the sun up .
the sun goes .
now , he &apos;s catching a tra@@ ctor in the scene .
the orange tra@@ ctor .
good work ! yes !
by shaking the si@@ ddle , and he puts it next to the characters .
... invent his own story .
hi !
it &apos;s a story with open end , and it can decide how they evolved .
flying cat .
the last example that i &apos;ve been doing now is to show it , it &apos;s a music show for global performances , which we &apos;ve recently developed , and in the si@@ cer as sound , like leadership , bass and things .
each has four different variations ; you can select that you want to use .
and you can put those notes into the sequence that you can put in any patterns .
and you do it by just holding a ton of sound on a sequence of a pattern .
there are effects you can change live like , like hall and filter .
you connect it to a certain tone , and then it tends to hire it .
and then , again , the effects like speed and volume that you apply to the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we &apos;re beginning to put in the leadership in two sequencing si@@ ctors and put them in a row , expand it and adding a little more voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do something about it .
and now i connect the filter with the stuff so i can steer the effect live .
i can accelerate the entire sequence by putting the pace into one or a different direction .
and now i &apos;m connecting the filter with the bass , for more expression .
i can put the sequence in as it works .
so , i don &apos;t have to plan it in the field , but it can improvise ; it &apos;s expanding or cuts .
and finally , i can conclude all the sequence by turning the sound to the left .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my excitement is to create new human computer sets , which is better to fit as our brains and bodies work .
and now i had time to show you a part of this new design world and some of the possibilities of what we work on in our lab .
the idea that i &apos;m going to leave you with is that we are at the threshold to this new generation of valu@@ ors to interact with digital media that will bring information into our world that is our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m looking forward to all of you .
yeah , good day .
i &apos;m delighted i &apos;m there .
yeah , so what should be bio@@ hacking ?
i &apos;ve got to get a little out of it , and it &apos;s bio@@ hacking with the modern molecular biology .
i study molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been doing a couple of years now with the bio@@ hacking , and i started that , because i just wanted to know , and i wanted to make it more specific to what i learned in the study of science .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to sort of get into things like matter .
i think the molecular biology is generally speaking , so in general , biotechnology , everything you count , synthetic biology and so on .
it &apos;s very important , now , is very important , and much , much more important will be in the future .
there are so controversial things like these all of these genetically engineered plants on the branches .
now , craig venter is in the united states , trying to make bio@@ x-@@ ells , so the gasoline of algae .
and then , you know , there &apos;s also some things that have been left in the daily life , which is , you know , most people , but , for example , washing enzymes that allow us to wash with four degrees washing , are also more sophisticated .
and the list can continue to continue .
and so from the interest of this , at this point of technology , i &apos;m going to go further .
now , why now ?
most people know what most people know about the software .
computers , and then it &apos;s going to happen in the media that way , yes , the hackers break somewhere and claws and so on .
it &apos;s kind of sad for the hacking scene , because that &apos;s not what you can do , which is actually what it &apos;s about , and what actually stands behind .
and in fact , the software hackers , in the 70s , &apos; 70s , started with computer construction , and that &apos;s where the internet came from .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , original way of solving a problem .
and the problem , it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a gateway problem , which is how things imit@@ ate things , so you can get any problem , or how you can do that .
and it &apos;s been used with software , but it &apos;s also in the electric area , and there &apos;s also a whole set of paper that has electric circuits to make all kinds of possible things .
and now , in the direction of biology , and i want this metaphor that comes out of synthetic biology , which is that biology is actually an abstract science , because , the d.@@ n@@ .@@ a code is an abstract code , which is an abstract code , because it &apos;s more dynamic , because it &apos;s a matter , it &apos;s real matter , and not just cyber .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program it , and you can also put it on , and that &apos;s how i find incredibly intriguing , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper .
now , this actually took two and a half of a thousand , really .
there &apos;s hacking dot dot , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe , and with a cooperation in india , but now members of india , but now have members of people around the world .
this is a more artistic pathway , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers , and in collaboration with scientists , working with researchers with these technologies and re@@ process these technologies and process the creative , there &apos;s a museum exhibi@@ tions and yes , all kinds of things .
but it &apos;s always about finding such a more remote access to it , so you have a playful deal with it .
and then , you know , there &apos;s do-it-@@ yourself organic oil dot , d.@@ i.@@ y@@ .@@ organic .
this is from the united states a network , which is actually more like the kind of forum where you &apos;re going to hit and talk online .
they &apos;re a bit technical and a bit of a bit more technical on the road , and then they get asked .
and based on these networks that have done the whole popular thing , it &apos;s evolved as a scene that i would like to replicate for a minute .
here in the picture on the left you see bio@@ boarding , which is a hacker@@ space , which is basically a kind of school , a private school , non-profit a facility where everybody can come .
kids , old , old , all kinds of people go to it , just put them together , they set up a laboratory , and look at what you can do when these lab protocols .
on the left here , a group of indonesia , hou@@ d &apos;s hierarchy , is called the , but it &apos;s quite a long time .
it &apos;s longer than these other two networks .
they &apos;re also in such an artistic aspect with biological materials , and , yes , electric buil@@ ds , and they combine that in a pretty noisy way .
a group of ank@@ ara , which i &apos;ve known about a while ago , which is a student group that would like to teach the public to the public , what they learn in school , and they &apos;ve been doing so on the street , and they tried to explain what d.@@ n@@ .@@ a is .
and i have a lecture on the other side in copenhagen in copenhagen in copenhagen in the medical museum with a show of a show .
and this is , yes , that &apos;s mostly pretty young people , but the only thing that all united states is , is this fascination of technology .
and what you can do with it , and it &apos;s also very specific to society to go and ask , so , okay , what do you want to do , what do you want to do ?
so , o.@@ k now to hack biology , you need some kinds of material .
you need biological materials , of course , and you need tools , and it &apos;s then a laboratory .
otherwise , what you normally understand under a laboratory , these are kind of false machines , extremely expensive , extremely distances , just for professionals , trained academics , trained academics and so on .
and our approach was to say , okay , we don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s not necessary , because every single coffee car engine has actually increased technology as the most developed technology , which is really like this .
and with this premise with this premise , brian de@@ gger , in england , tried to put a minim@@ ally in england , then took a minim@@ ally , and then took a waste of pressure , a hot plate , and , you know , it &apos;s made bacteria .
so anyone who has a soup of soup is that it &apos;s been used too long , as well .
i then tried this in my lab at home , a little bit , and then made me a little bit , and then made me a little bit of a d.@@ n@@ .@@ a analysis on ebay , trying to make a father , trying to print a father , so you can go home .
it shouldn &apos;t be a joke now , but it should .
here in the picture , you see the laboratory , in terms of leadership , so it &apos;s sort of admit@@ ed garage with all sorts of lab comedy comedy that &apos;s been balanced in college , a group in paris , which is what has built , and it &apos;s quite successful , and it &apos;s quite successful , and i want to cut a project .
and this is bio@@ boarding , which is also mentioned a hacker@@ space , which is , you know , a kind of folk school , basically for molecular biology .
and yeah , so you see , you see , it &apos;s relatively relatively concrete , so there &apos;s some people who do it on their own home , up to larger organizations , which is the case that the more malware has already done in an institutional form .
but always the way that it &apos;s going to be easy and available .
the first project that we &apos;ve done as an international group , as we were to be aware of our self , wa@@ k , and we &apos;re now here as a real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people who used to cook and so forth .
and then , of course , from the hunter-gather@@ ate organic website , the founder of the founders , and they said o.@@ k , we &apos;ve got to make it real , also real true , and then we have two events organized , one in london , two-@@ thousand , and shortly in the united states , in san francisco .
and , you know , then it was about , yes , yes , who are we , what do we want , what do we want to say ?
and what are our values , and what are our values , our foundations ?
and then we &apos;ve been working on this kind of co@@ de-@@ by-@@ bust .
it was very intuitive , so everybody just has his wishes , his wishes , and what it would move to , then , then .
and i think there was a very good code done .
and then , you know , we don &apos;t have it , but it &apos;s still , you know , i think it &apos;s pretty well done , that people are quite convinced of this .
and then we even tried to bring it back into the academic world , but it &apos;s somehow not there .
so , i think we &apos;re from the bio@@ hacking scene , in fact , more than the academic world .
so , what do we do now ?
a project that i did with the hacking network in switzerland was that we wanted to build an optical trap or optical pink .
this is , if you focus a laser beam , in one in the space , then you can capture small particles in the air , or in the liquid , and then move in that focus , which is , you know , sort of a tra@@ ctor officer .
this really works , this is what &apos;s done in academic settlement , and we thought , o.@@ k , we might be able to get it , then we took a webcam that stops the lens , which is the lens , which is about four hundred degrees .
you see this down there .
and then we &apos;ve separated a d.@@ v@@ .@@ d bren@@ ner , and the burning the beam comes out , and then tries to focus on this camera .
and unfortunately , it didn &apos;t work , but we still learned a lot about it .
this is a different project that comes from the french group in paris , which has done it , it &apos;s pretty cool .
and he &apos;s like this , you know , a brain wave device , so e.@@ e.@@ g , or something like this , so he &apos;s engaged with neuro@@ biology , his nick@@ name is sam neuro@@ hack .
he then got this helmet up there , and in the cooperation of the museum , that &apos;s gone .
and then the visitors could go into the room , put on this chair , put on this helmet .
then their brain waves were measured , and depending on what they thought , or how they thought , is then different lights in the space .
it was a pretty good project .
a different thing from the united states , which also has to do with this fellow test story , is the p.@@ c.@@ r , which is the poly@@ mer@@ as@@ -@@ road reaction , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes , to replicate , d.@@ n@@ .@@ a , fragments , so you can make it visible .
so , now , when i do this , i &apos;m going to get the pro@@ fil@@ er on the tat@@ ard , then you go there , collect any hair samples , and then they do this sort of thing , and then you can say , o.@@ k , this hair belongs to this person .
and the machines that make something like this are quite expensive that you &apos;re buying , the cheap@@ est ones go to four thousand dollars .
and it &apos;s not in the hob@@ side , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be very much .
so this is just an application of many that you can do with it .
and they &apos;ve been making two buil@@ ders , and they said , &quot; pan@@ k , that &apos;s going to make us easier and cheaper , and then , you know , we have open source of open source , you know , free hardware , electric stuff , and now they &apos;ve actually brought that together and are now the cheap@@ est ven@@ ce of these devices .
i think it &apos;s sort of six or something like this .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s definitely in a context where it &apos;s going to be more complicated .
so , i think it &apos;s a very obvious hack .
a project i started to build was to build a gene gun .
gen@@ e-@@ gun is , yes , such as an aerial pressure gun , which shoots about so far , two centimeters or something .
you drill tab@@ n@@ .@@ a on gold matter , and the gold@@ -@@ particles , then , in this air pressure , and then i &apos;ve pulled that up on top , and then i &apos;ve got it .
so the device you see is not working .
but this is the kind of my prototype , but it &apos;s kind of looked like this in a branch of a branch , the thing to put electronics on it , put electronics on it , and that was , the pressure was too high , the thing was broken .
and then i took a laugh , and i did it .
a sa@@ ppy pen@@ der , if you make the full power with water , has enough pressure , i think , so four and a half of them .
and with that , you can accelerate the particles strong enough , and then you can go into the ground .
and the commercial device costs about five thousand dollars up@@ wards or something like this , or something like the 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically feasi@@ able .
so , in the moment , this is the real cause of the scene to increase this availability of technology and also increase the information and the possibility that more people can engage .
because , as i said at the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have pretty little idea about it , and also no chance of making themselves really good .
because , if you just read about it , from secondary literature , that &apos;s not the same as once you &apos;ve done it or seen it .
and i think technology will always become more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to be able to make meaningful decisions in society , you want to be able to speak and talk , you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to make it and understand it and understand it .
and that will turn open to the number of words open and citizen science .
so , you just think of as citizens being able to re@@ connect with these scientific technologies .
and this is the ultimate cause of the bio@@ hackers .
these are the people who are at least officially owned on the website , d.@@ i.@@ y@@ .@@ bio website .
this is a very substantial number of people around the world .
and the interesting thing is , they &apos;re also represented in southeast asia .
i think that &apos;s because there are fewer people in it than actually exist .
so i know some people who don &apos;t have them .
and these are just the bio@@ hackers , the individual people .
and in fact , in part of these hacker@@ spaces , these places put together .
and that &apos;s really the beginning .
as i said , two people just started .
and hacker@@ spaces , so the computer linux space , because the c base in berlin was the first , 13 hundred hundred pounds .
and this is now a gigantic network of very good , yes , infra@@ structural centers that are represented throughout the world .
and what we hope , of course , is that we &apos;re going to be doing it in the same way , and then it &apos;s similar to us as well as a result of people .
and i would invite everybody to join with it , and also to try and explore .
it &apos;s not so simple now , but it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not impossible to have enough curiosity and enough energy , then you get there .
thank you very much .
that &apos;s it .
yeah , hi .
how do we actually work ?
this is a question that moves me very , very , very moved as a designer , but also in the field of the study of users .
it &apos;s about how you present people in interactive media so that they can use this interactive media and make them a more satisfying experience .
because i think the interactive media is in our arch@@ a@@ ian , cognitive models , so thinking of patterns that have been programmed in our biological memory very , very long ago , and that we can only cause them through interactive media .
and it &apos;s very amazing , because , you know , that the whole technology that you &apos;ve seen is that you can actually bring one of them into the future , but in fact , the future is in our arch@@ a@@ an roots .
what are the arch@@ a@@ ian models now ?
i &apos;ve been writing four words , and i want to explain to you briefly .
now , to arch@@ a@@ an cognitive models , that &apos;s the models we have in the pre-@@ industrial times .
to this arch@@ a@@ an models , that we have a virtual relationship with virtu@@ ality .
that sounds essentially unusual .
but i &apos;m going to take you back to that , and i &apos;m going to show you to prove that you have a natural proportion of sand .
the second point is that since this arch@@ a@@ an models , we &apos;ve been able to speak very , very visual , even though we &apos;re using a mechan@@ fied language now .
and the third area , which really explains itself .
we all know that the interactive media is the definition of non@@ linear , which is the listening of the linear@@ ity , and what , of course , is that we feel the linear@@ ity today .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of information .
now , what is the virtu@@ ality that is actually the most natural thing in the world .
i want to prove that to you .
how many doors have the house where they live ?
we &apos;re not going to be able to answer it immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen right now .
you go in the mind through this house , as they live , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what they do .
they psychopath the reality , it &apos;s very without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and we &apos;re going to be interested in the media campus , for example , the virtual reality in our v@@ .@@ k lab , so we can actually do this all the time .
and this wealth that makes the virtual difference the reality , that people in the previous industrial times have also used to be irri@@ ned , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have a photo@@ li@@ to@@ graphy .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only thing that they had was her head .
and in this mind , memory was playing .
in this mind , knowledge was known , and with this virtual images , the imagination , that was also passed on .
and so it &apos;s also so strong in us that we can deal with the virtu@@ ality as well .
the interesting thing is , if i can make a little trip .
yeah , it goes .
the interesting thing about this is that at that time , the man was media producers and medium itself .
now , if you think a little bit further .
what are the media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice there &apos;s been a change .
but i &apos;ll talk to you about that again .
fundamental tools of information education have been since all of the stories .
sha@@ ans , priest , so-called knowledge prote@@ ders , were extra to keep knowledge in stories .
and we &apos;re still very , very strong of stories today .
the author of the book of the book , jonathan got@@ ater all , we still have a year of thousands of hundred hours a year with the revi@@ ctor of stories .
that means that for a kid to get it to the reach of the great , the most part of his life has spent in the future of stories .
now , we think our love to stories depends on that we sat as a child on the lap of our parents .
no , no , no .
it goes far further to the cultures of the pre-@@ industrial times .
but for me , in the interactive media , the most amazing thing for me is that we put ourselves in our biological memory , the ability to think non@@ linear .
i &apos;ve brought you an example of the north north american tribe of the no@@ ot@@ ka indian .
and life lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very island area , and you just had to navigate there , come from island to island to get food .
and they made this so-called so-called le@@ ad@@ -@@ land@@ maps .
now , you know , you know , if you care about it , you &apos;re a little bit interested in the australian uranium .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have le@@ ad@@ -@@ land@@ maps , but they &apos;ve been using the way that they used to be used , and they &apos;re also being abused .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navigation and the topo@@ graphy of regions could be mapped by songs .
and the language of the language was under@@ rated .
that means , you navi@@ ed about sound and on rhythm .
and these sound and this rhythm , the ge@@ ology , represent the topo@@ graphy of a region , and , of course , that , of course , that you could be able to re@@ assemble these songs and put it in other ways , to the left , to move back to the left .
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to come from a to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s actually going on ?
this is what &apos;s happened as the nan@@ nan@@ te machine age .
we &apos;ve moved to the so-called ground age before .
now , this is the machine age , and this is the book , and this is the photo@@ li@@ to@@ graphy .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens to us that we have the responsibility for our memories , and that the production of our individual memories has shifted on external media .
on the book and on the picture .
so , unfortunately , god , unfortunately , we have a piece of comfort to sand .
virtu@@ ality , suddenly , has become alien for us , and has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a famous design researcher at the bri@@ gh@@ ton university , is so far to say that the mass media , he says the book and the image , so not the television , and the image , so not the tv , the internet , and so on , what we call the mass media of our memories , and our ability to be compassionate .
let &apos;s make a little bit .
from the vo@@ g@@ age age to the machine age .
what has changed to our thinking and our minds ?
then the relative of the pre-@@ industrial cultures are .
and they &apos;re in the course of the centuries over the centuries , more and more recently been written by the nature of the machine .
that means , instead of remembering ourselves , we have standardi@@ zed , far common , in masses of memories that we can relate to our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce more itself .
we have an abstract silver language .
we don &apos;t think about things more in pictures that don &apos;t do things more in pictures , but we encode our language .
we used to think that things are linear .
and we &apos;ve accepted the linear@@ ity as law , and there &apos;s only exceptions , such as the non-@@ linear@@ ity .
what has remained is the gluten .
still , we &apos;re being arrested as information education very , very strong .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
we had the vo@@ ck age , we had the machine age , and we now describe the so-called cyber age .
it sounds very voyager , and it sounds very like science fiction , i know .
but these concepts of the cyber age , which brings us these possibilities back again .
it &apos;s about virtu@@ ality , it &apos;s about non@@ linear@@ ity , it &apos;s about tivo .
i just want to explain this a little bit .
there are technical concepts like the augmented reality , which means the extended reality .
so , if you look at google , for example , it &apos;s a concept of what &apos;s going to allow us to combine the virtual world with the real world , which means our ingenuity to virtu@@ alization to feel virtual as something normal , again .
another example is the so-called virtual reality .
that &apos;s crazy , of course , it might sound as crazy in the context of my talk , because we &apos;re physically moving into not environments , virtual worlds , for the model of the cockroach .
and others are the ambitious , smart systems .
these are spaces that can respond to people .
all of this needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtu@@ ality as a real habitat .
i &apos;m in conclusion , and i &apos;m hoping to work the video , a very , very beautiful project , which is , you know , it &apos;s done by michael bur@@ k in kr@@ ence , jor@@ is lau@@ tz and la mor@@ it@@ z .
and those who are the last , too , are here today .
maybe you can get up for a minute , so you can be able to talk about the project .
and i brought this project as an example of , again , to this arch@@ a@@ ian , cognitive model .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say .
which of course , of course , it &apos;s extremely noisy , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i say a computer game , it &apos;s very likely to think that there are some people who are happy to enjoy some of the conventions , or that they play with some of the con@@ br@@ ine .
anyway , they &apos;re in doing this .
this is a game for outside .
and this is a sense of thinking that i examine the outside world , so i re@@ examine the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data is the data that we produce with the real world .
i apologize that i must cut down so much .
you can explain this much better , then there &apos;s more .
and it &apos;s because i &apos;m exploring a city by looking at what places was positive or negative .
and so i get from the city a very different view , a very different impression , which is , i see negative and positive zones of a city , and i &apos;m going to get a very different , virtual map of a very real city .
and we can look at that now .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explanation of what you &apos;re seeing .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , yeah .
and with a kind of flash@@ light , we can make this virtual worlds visible .
so , i would like to put this in my talk , and in the sense that the properties and the skills that we &apos;ve acquired from the ground &apos;s age , and that would have gone out of us a little bit like this , and that &apos;s the way that we &apos;re going to be able to do a little bit about complex age , and that we can go back to our roots .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very pleased to be with you .
i &apos;ve been wondering if this bag is a speaker &apos;s bag , and i &apos;m going to talk to you .
it &apos;s not going to happen .
i &apos;m also going to dis@@ solve what &apos;s inside .
but i &apos;ve been doing it a little bit earlier .
yeah , kids are from nature , or should be curious , as well as designers .
i &apos;m an age of house , so , of course , i &apos;m also working on the issue of curiosity , and how the curiosity also changes our thinking , and why we might lose curiosity , and we need to go back to new curiosity .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re doing with the actual existence as an agent .
when professors are curious , they &apos;re often going to get into this research research .
and that &apos;s also what i was about half a year .
a research on natural user interface design .
now , you &apos;re going to be wondering , why are you going to start with all the extra age of natural , arch@@ a@@ an ti@@ forms of communication , interaction and so on .
and i &apos;m just holding one of these little devices , because things are always supposed to be more intuitive , more natural , more natural , more natural , and you have to look at it , which is , of course , for people , which is , of course , to us , which is , of course , to us , or intuitively .
and in front of the background , i have design in the area of natural user interface , so the next generation in the human computer in the relationship of the human computer is dealing with how our tools or how the computer is changing from the machines to the digital assistant .
so , i took care of when , of course , what , or intuitively .
maybe again , a look at it .
why does this happen ?
so , if we look at the evolution of our society , here &apos;s what we &apos;re looking at , we &apos;re moving from the third to the fourth generation , or social form .
so from modern to the computer company .
every society is shaped by a primary medium .
at the beginning , the tribal society is through language .
that means , you &apos;ve been talking to a common language , you could communicate with each other , you could communicate in the same cave , or in other areas , has developed cities or villages , and it &apos;s designed in such tribal society .
the primary medium was the language , something very natural , something very different .
also , you &apos;ve got to learn , not a small child can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning about it , and we &apos;re going to learn it , obviously .
it was then solved by the ancient society and the first form of abstra@@ ction .
this was a big out@@ cry back then , because , of course , the living language started to manifest in the form of writing , which is what fluid and lifestyle is , and i put it in stone and i put it in stone .
and , of course , depending on how i ch@@ el , and , of course , it &apos;s a very different narrative than there &apos;s a lifetime of life .
but in fact , su@@ k@@ z@@ onal , then , went into this script as primary medium .
then the next generation , where we &apos;re actually still alive .
this is just using pressure and print writing with gu@@ berg and others .
in the back of the time , it was just an aff@@ mu@@ t , where a@@ del , tri@@ er@@ us and others said , are you really insane when the people started reading , and that &apos;s really completely fatal .
and now we &apos;re going to come to the next generation , and the most exciting thing is , a gener@@ atory shift is just a few hundred years , and we &apos;re really now in this phenomenal phase that we do this .
that seems to us , of course , because we &apos;re seeing the new media , social social media , facebook us@@ w and so on .
with absolute transparency , what the new thinking is , what is the old thinking , don &apos;t say that in the laser ca@@ b beef , and no beef is more or other phenomena , which is what i want to do now , and i want to do that .
and these two worlds just bang together , new and old thinking .
the interesting thing about this is , if you look at this , this new society , this computer company , has a very variety of mechanisms , principles and arch@@ a@@ an paradigm from the tribal society .
but now not at the local level , it &apos;s on global level .
we understood that weather is global .
that the issue of ecology is global .
not , if i think about local green , and the neighbor is less organic , it doesn &apos;t work .
that means , from the local village , it &apos;s actually become a global village with the same principles , more of course , but the total transparency .
so , as you knew in the village , who &apos;s got what &apos;s going on with whom and when , this is what &apos;s happening today about this expansion of our self through these mobile devices on the global level .
it &apos;s that we know global spheres and always faster and faster and better .
just like it was just happening in the village .
so , in front of the background , i just used to look at it , what does it mean , which is , of course , what &apos;s going on for us , which is , you know , what &apos;s also the difference for us , what &apos;s the difference ?
because often people get people , they can &apos;t make it friendly , so anybody can handle it .
so you have to deal with what is , because it &apos;s not just changing , it &apos;s different , but it should be better .
and , of course , when , of course , something intuitive , and , of course , i can take advantage of it as an agent , and the things that make things like that is to be more intuitive , so it &apos;s very intuitive , because then they &apos;re fun to use .
you do it , also , in the study of the study , with the subject of perception and the perceptual process .
and this is , of course , where you start and look and look , okay , now , i &apos;m just looking inside the inner self .
and what does it look like in there ?
so how do we work when we look inside ?
and , of course , what does it mean , intuitive , and how do our channels of perception work , and how does the cognitive process work ?
because steve jobs used to say , you know , you &apos;ve got to get a certificate to 12@@ show guer@@ show it .
so you really have to look at the detail , if i want to make something friendly or intuitively hand-@@ cu@@ able , which means that in the core .
and you see , you know , you know , one of our seven senses , most people think we &apos;ve only got five , now , in fact , it &apos;s already seven , because , in the near future , there &apos;s still the next , eighth sense of our self .
and how do we process information , how do we take information ?
to say , what is information ?
information is a difference to the difference .
many use the word , but not knowing what it means .
but i have to understand in the core in the essence , where the information becomes information , when will information information from information , and from information again , so i know how i can do things in the same way , or , of course , hand@@ cu@@ able .
and of course , design is going to affect perception .
we see this here , if i turn things out , then i can fake them on the side of the right , where i don &apos;t know , what is salt and pepper boards , or i can kind of make them intuitive by showing things .
so , very much more natural , in a vessel , but i see right now , where is salt and pepper tails in it .
and when i say somebody , give me salt or pepper , then he will think about the right , where it &apos;s in the right .
and then , on the left , you can get intuitive access , and then i hope that there is no sugar in it .
but also our perception itself , how does it sound .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks bigger than the small , even though it &apos;s not the case , but it &apos;s very accurate , but it &apos;s very similar to our perception , depending on what context we put in .
anyone know what this is ?
come on .
punishment should still work .
it &apos;s going to be more like my glasses .
so it &apos;s the circle .
a second circle is already starting to relate or associate .
and then , if i take a look at a hal@@ ddle , then we don &apos;t look at one more unit , which is a circle , circle , circle , and we see a unit , we don &apos;t see more three pieces , a circle , a circle .
that &apos;s what you call the source of the law , or some basic psychology , which also affects us in perception .
it &apos;s very important for the creator , mostly the first semester , the great laws of law .
the law of the presence of the presence of the continuity and so on .
so often in the third , again , forgotten .
but this is an essential important component , if you just want to design things very closely .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is very interesting .
sounds very banal , but it &apos;s very interesting when you &apos;re dealing with it .
so we have the eyes , and now you think , we &apos;re looking at the front .
it &apos;s wrong .
you can see from the back .
because , you know , they &apos;re pro@@ posing a premise that you can see something that you recognize , which is obvious .
that means we &apos;re pro@@ posing our first view , before we see it in the back of our sou@@ y , to say , okay .
i &apos;ve got this kind of culture back , you have what you would like to see .
it &apos;s also there , it comes back .
it goes back to the front , because the back of the back is not going to look at the front and say , well , look at it , and i think , you know , what you see is also what you want to see .
and then it goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s actually seen .
so a very , very exciting process of how things happen , and what a few milli@@ second areas do happen .
i don &apos;t know who you know this picture .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i &apos;ve just described .
now everybody &apos;s trying to recognize something .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes .
anyone see something special ?
a dal@@ ma@@ tin@@ er , exactly .
if i saw this , that &apos;s because there &apos;s a dal@@ son in there , you know that .
you &apos;re never going to forget about it , because i &apos;m going to show you where the hirshhorn artist is .
now you see the shepherd ma@@ tin@@ er .
and further , now you see it .
that means , you know , i &apos;ve got it now , basically , that you don &apos;t see any pattern in it , but i &apos;ve got it in a very short time to see this dog again .
and this is this projection of vision , re@@ crea@@ ding feedback .
now i know it , and now i &apos;m pro@@ posing , i &apos;m looking forward , that i see the dal@@ bot .
i see the dal@@ bot .
so , very , very exciting processes that then in this , yes , gray , it &apos;s actually not , but here in this raw mass of mass .
does anyone know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
this is our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
now , if i know something about three seconds , until i kind of get out of the present in the front of the past , then i can do a very good job of waiting , in which i &apos;m always doing it with three seconds .
it &apos;s just to process the present .
then it moves into the past , so i can get very elegant wait for example , for example , when i know this phenomenon .
what about five milli@@ milliseconds ?
yeah , milliseconds .
it &apos;s also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the time you fall in love with .
that means , warning , if you know this , look at how long you &apos;re looking at how long you see , because i don &apos;t have a store for what can happen to you .
and six milli@@ milliseconds , also a very interesting phenomenon .
this is the period of most perceptions we have .
that is , this first impression happens in a fast fast speed , as we perceive things .
and as we can see things , what we &apos;re looking for , and how we &apos;re going to be able to protect ourselves against our environment so that we can think about it .
of course , the creator doesn &apos;t just relate to the subject of perceptions and neural processing or cognitive processing , but primary , of course , with the topic of the human-@@ object relationship .
so , how does a person handle things like this .
and there is a product of language , which is the practical functions , so formal aspects or astronomical aspects .
there &apos;s an approach where i know exactly where i have to reach .
now , there &apos;s also symbolic functions , why there &apos;s somebody like this for a little bit , where don &apos;t there be anything in it , so horror money , even though it &apos;s not that handy ?
we &apos;re more likely to think about the symbolic level , which is , of course , as a creator .
and back to my actual subject of natural user interface and the subject , which of course , which is , of course , is us@@ fty .
us@@ bule always means , how can i get to a certain goal , or how can an users be in a certain use of the context of effective , efficient and happiness .
that &apos;s what the norm says .
how can i make something more friendly ?
i can use that directly , or i need to use it , or i need to use it .
and it &apos;s less manifest@@ ation , or it &apos;s not a uni@@ ment .
that i &apos;m making this just different and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better .
you have to understand that .
and then , you know , if you look at the software that we &apos;ve seen , then you &apos;ll see , you know , why nine percent of our today &apos;s software is slightly intuitive or not available on an@@ famous b , the i-@@ pad in many scales or i , including , including more intuitive than classical software .
it &apos;s an intuitive issue not only since apple has a fundamental economic factor , the fundamental factor of success , if i just want to make technology .
why ?
because in the rule , we &apos;re using this new kind of value , which is the natural user record , for example , five times faster to our goal .
you have to think that , if you do something of the classical so@@ dge , five hours , you have to have one of these new kinds of natural software .
it doesn &apos;t mean that you can probably go home four hours to go home , but your emplo@@ yer , or some of you , will be in charge of the four hours .
but , of course , i want to say that , of course , it &apos;s an equal capacity for us to do things .
if we go back into the field of software , here &apos;s the first line of the interfaces that were very abstract , where they took months to deal with these systems .
and then the next , the next , the next neural model , or mental model like software &apos;s software , were working , because you have a notion of something , the metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop to make the computer useful .
so no longer zer@@ oes and ones , or cryp@@ yp@@ tic code , but a metaphor .
it made this much more powerful , but it &apos;s also a lot better .
the next generation of the graphic process works very much more with behavior .
so , i think it &apos;s a lot more frequently than making that look .
this is also a paradigm shift .
that , at once , the appearance is always more important for success , the us@@ gator will be an app .
and then , if i go back to this natural user interface , where i am in voice , by language , versus gesture , by gesture , by gesture , and no longer have to control things , then i &apos;m even more qui@@ cker and more .
and that brings me back to the point , where will things be more intuitive ?
when you get more intuitive , and then i have to go back to my little friend here , and look at it , what does that mean from the point of cognition , when &apos;s it really intuitive ?
and that is , for us humans , it &apos;s something intuitively intuitive , if i have to think more about it .
so he doesn &apos;t like to think , but it &apos;s pretty easy to do .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does this mean for the designers ?
that means , if we can look at existing models from one thing to something else , for example , the metaphor , then i can use that as an age .
that means , i can transfer a very intuitive human model into a software , and it &apos;s making the software more powerful .
now , of course , the question is , what &apos;s the most intuitive part of us , and now i &apos;ve already told you .
this is the so-called agile model .
it uses each one of us and o@@ jad is an acr@@ onym and it stands for liber@@ ation , selected , translated .
that makes each of them all the time , but it makes it un@@ consciously , and it &apos;s kind of intuitive , or partly instinctively .
the model is going to be in the womb , and it &apos;s inter@@ cultural , so it works in the world at young and old , and it &apos;s used all the time , without most people ever known that this model is present .
o@@ ubi@@ o@@ kis is going to be about 50 to seven times of all of us in action , so in sleep , you have noticed that it &apos;s going to be less often than the day .
i can now classi@@ fy this mental model model , selected , proof , trans@@ fers to a interaction system .
and through this kind of transmission , similar to the metaphor of the act , now , but not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a constitu@@ le , a towel .
and this is on a higher degree of state kindness , which is the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the desktop .
and if i take this over now , for example , as i &apos;m measuring , as a result , as a result , to be able to cheat as a selection , in the case of the case , it comes large to me , i can look at it in detail , and i can send it to you , or buy someone , or buy it .
then i can transmit this whole thing .
i &apos;m trying this by an unprecedented example .
now , you &apos;ve been eating cake .
in fact , now , i &apos;m going to interact with the object , again , to zoom in .
i &apos;m going to get to the whole picture of this , and you can see here , and i can tell you , you know , just show me all , chocolate .
and once again , a interface , which is more intuitive and much more natural .
because i can grab things like the bits , touch , and it can come to me , it &apos;s much more natural than if you &apos;re about hierarch@@ cally organized websites or other mechanisms , you can make these things available .
imagination is more po@@ ther , and with this phrase , i would like to end up with the phrase , a and again , and also , again , designer must think differently to come to new solutions , and in this sense , i thank you very much for your attention and please .
i want to help you with a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first , if you &apos;re a kid , as a baby , it &apos;s going to take care of what you might have , right ? and depending on if your parents have allowed them to play , right ? and by the time that their parents have allowed them to play more or less .
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
these are all the people who are here and curious , in fact , people who have a trait that you cannot learn .
it &apos;s about it , basically this whole environmental discussion , the world set , four and a half years of clu@@ b , in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point there .
and it depends on phosphorus .
add pe@@ e a chance .
you spend two grams every day , you give scale to scale , and you have to take two grams of phosphorus every day .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could just cut off the oceans .
if we did not have a phosphorus and we do it .
so , as an astonishing thing , it &apos;s so that we &apos;re dealing with something that is actually self-@@ conscious , but not that way .
because everyone talks about energy , but nobody talks about the phosphorus problem .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we &apos;ve only got phosphorus for two years , and now we &apos;re going to have a lot more uranium in the world than it &apos;s used in all nuclear facilities .
in the last twenty years alone , five thousand tons of uranium have been distributed in our fields in germany .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re taking .
it does leukemia in leukemia .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a bit less harmful .
so , for example , the environment , break less cars .
hold the environment , make less trash .
drop the environment , takes less energy .
it &apos;s not protection .
this is the way i would say , hold your kid , just take three times 10 times .
it &apos;s just a bit less destruction .
if we think about it from the point to ba@@ ise , our whole earth used to be used or later a ce@@ ce@@ tery .
that &apos;s about thinking about what &apos;s happening .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground as the first one .
in the ground , over six percent of the carbon is stored .
at the moment , we &apos;re building ma@@ ma@@ ize , and we &apos;re building food between 11 and 30 kilograms of 30 tons per acre , or on the square meter .
that means we &apos;re losing on the ground about five inches more than being re@@ formed .
we can , of course , look at the trash problem .
and everything is yes or content .
so , in open stream , for example , at the home , the home is 20 percent of the amount of waste .
and because we &apos;re older , the wind gets bigger .
it &apos;s kind of all in the front stage .
yes ?
a baby needs about six inches .
we could reduce that by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this is balanced in china in a second .
it &apos;s completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we deal with this wind ?
one of the reasons , by the way , is that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is emitted in the pigs about the strong components .
people about the ur@@ ine .
yeah .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s it , right ?
in traditionally , we think in the environmental debate , we &apos;re too many in the world .
and if you have the people who are talking to people , if you say , that &apos;s better , you &apos;re not going to be there , then they will be refined and hostile .
and so someone like al gore says , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing more important than stabilize the human population .
in israel , if you save a patient , you save the earth .
here it says , the more you carry , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants weigh about four more than we humans .
i could also take ter@@ mites , but in the united states , no one might have ter@@ mites , even though they &apos;re veget@@ arians .
that means the ants weigh much more than us .
and because they work physically much tougher than we are , and because they live only three to six months , they &apos;re in their weight , in energy energy , something 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too dumb , we &apos;re too dumb , right ?
and where you see how far we &apos;re going to do , what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , we can see that , for example , open , you can see , for example , open a program , up until 20 , you want to be neutral neutral , right ?
you can only be neutral neutral if you don &apos;t exist , right ?
the only opportunity .
have you seen a carbon-@@ neutral tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that means our whole intelligence means that we want to be angry as trees , right ?
yes ?
no tree is neutral .
happiness isn &apos;t , yes ?
there &apos;s no population problem in trees .
there &apos;s still six of them in the amazon field .
now , you &apos;ve heard about a population of over@@ population of trees ?
that means all our intelligence means we want to be angry as a trees .
and where you see , even in something like de@@ meter , the most stri@@ ghtest bio@@ -- yes , we don &apos;t allow our own metabolic materials .
every year we &apos;re losing so three million tons of phosphorus that really would have to go back into round@@ miles .
and so we &apos;re too many .
just about it .
that &apos;s what we feel so guilty about the earth that we &apos;re saying , there &apos;s no organic land , no concrete , no , of course , of course , and how they all say that our own selves go back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we are too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint , which is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s about the environment , it &apos;s the highest , right ?
nu@@ l@@ le@@ p , yes ?
you can only have nu@@ l@@ le@@ mage if you &apos;re not there .
even if you would shoot yourself , you would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can get our nutrients back .
we do in brazil in brazil , where we get rid of nutrients .
right now , we can get food back in agriculture .
we do this in china , for example , where we take directly the rest of them .
in china , what &apos;s going on in china is , you know , a bur@@ tt@@ e@@ f , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too dumb to bring our nutrients back .
this is , the entire western civili@@ cture story shows that the city always took away , but never gave the farmers back .
and then the cities had to grow more and more , because the farmers went into cities , and the cities had to move away from their nutrients .
so , all the western people are always expanding until they don &apos;t have the infrastructure anymore , and then they &apos;re im@@ plo@@ sive .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done a variety of civilization over five years , because you &apos;ve been able to bring food back .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to lunch in china , you would expect for food to stay until you look for the toilet .
because it &apos;s un@@ friendly to go and increase nutrients .
you &apos;ve invited them to lunch , not for food theft .
that means you can see on the internet , how you can win nutrients .
it &apos;s really nice , if you do that , and it makes agriculture , it creates bio@@ gas , in a hect@@ 0-@@ acre country in favelas , in a hect@@ 0-@@ acre country , in favelas , so that a farmer is going to grow about four and a half a hundred dollars , and the plant and the fruit and the fruit and the vegetables and fishes and fishes .
and the great thing about this is that the crime rate goes back to the favelas over nin@@ ety percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control people to be pretty bad .
we can support them to be good .
that &apos;s of course high-tech agriculture , but the facilities are carrying itself .
the side product is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed by the design that a farmer can just deploy .
that means the crime rates go back .
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve now built over a hundred million in the last twenty years , none of them has ever been bath@@ ed .
you could throw it in so easily a liter of al@@ fer , and then the plant would be ruined over years .
don &apos;t find it .
that means we don &apos;t have to control people to be pretty bad .
we can support them to be good .
that means we need to get phosphorus back .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , you write , in germany , in germany , in the best place , it &apos;s in france .
unfortunately , they &apos;re not in open stream , but maybe they can help the quake a little help .
because the cardi@@ ter plant could be the best return to the phosphorus .
and it has to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see it &apos;s absolutely done .
we &apos;ve been using it now over three years .
the dutch government explains , you &apos;re going to be the first country in the world , which is going to win phosphorus .
but we need this overall .
you know , there are two countries who control almost 80 percent of the phosphorus reserves .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of orphan@@ ages .
that &apos;s six and a half of them , which is four percent of the oil supplies .
and the oil is going to be able to replace through other energy sources .
but you can &apos;t replace the phosphorus .
so it &apos;s not about making the existing a bit less bad , it &apos;s about making something right .
and it &apos;s first to ask , what &apos;s the right thing .
it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in holland , it &apos;s easier to understand , because in holland , the country is on flowers .
yes ?
imagine , for example , your wife &apos;s sad , when you get upset , and you come to 50 ro@@ vers .
it &apos;s completely inefficient .
but it &apos;s very effective , right ?
or take a li@@ op .
a woman in germany eats about six com@@ ma kilograms in her lifetime .
there we go .
this isn &apos;t very scientific , because we don &apos;t know how much away it is going to be .
but a lip pen , even in this illumination , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but it &apos;s very effective , right ?
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s not resource efficiency , but efficiency .
to ask , what is the right ?
not to burn a bit better than you can burn a bit better and put it to it , and to keep it down and lose all kinds of materials for round@@ sum , but first to ask , how do you get circular ?
imagine mozart &apos;s efficient .
yes ?
when i invite them to dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with open streams and a glass of water .
wonderful , huh ?
it &apos;s efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
yes ?
that means everything that matters in life is not to save it .
the whole environmental debate .
we say people , oh , you don &apos;t have an environmental consciousness in the south .
no , the flip is exactly the right , right ?
in every place where you take away , from , you know , you create life .
but the wrong things .
if you take the wrong things away , you have a trash problem .
how we think about northern .
there &apos;s every footprint there .
if you walk , yes , all the foot is falling .
because on the ground , the mos@@ ses will die , and the wind , and the water , and the water is pushing away .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every pedestri@@ ation means that the water remains longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about making a big footprint that becomes a wetlands .
not school management .
we &apos;re in germany .
yes ?
but if i ask you , how do you do with your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
i &apos;m going to say , i &apos;m sorry , right ?
this is the minimum .
so not saving , not saving , avoid .
every waste is expensive .
and it &apos;s like , you know , when you see in italy , the people in the high bow get out of the car .
because you know , this is fun .
it &apos;s different , right ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed a string of ice , which is temperature temperature .
they can throw away where they go and stand .
in two hours , they move everywhere .
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that they &apos;re contributing to biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so there are two circles .
not everything should be com@@ po@@ able .
a television or a washing machine , they just use them , they don &apos;t use it .
just the things that burn , like shoe sol@@ es , like bra@@ th@@ s , like cars , they have to be in biological systems .
the things that are only used , go into technical systems .
but today , we &apos;re only talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the sne@@ aker , right ?
it &apos;s just direct advertising , not for the company pu@@ ma , but for the company that you &apos;re helping this company to be successful .
because we don &apos;t make things more freely .
yes ?
so , if i invite them to the food , and i say , that &apos;s free , then it doesn &apos;t help you .
no , we hold what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like de@@ to@@ x .
not toxic in it .
but everything that &apos;s inside is useful .
that &apos;s the first pair of shoes that you can put on the bare light on the pedestri@@ an light , and the rubber can go into bio@@ spheres , right ?
everything is com@@ hear@@ able by this .
and if you can do it , of course , it works for obese , for nike , for hen@@ nes and toast@@ tz and the whole textile industry .
and that &apos;s half of all the water problems in the world that will cause by the textile industry .
that &apos;s why they help , ask them to people .
hey , pu@@ ma , do you really get serious ?
because they &apos;ve changed twice the fore@@ holder .
and i &apos;m not sure if you really stay .
so , help me a little bit .
but it goes .
yeah .
what &apos;s been represented .
this is happening .
we can do things now that , if you get drunk , you can get in biological circles .
there are technical circuits .
there &apos;s a direct return system for this .
this is the first green pack , actually , which is made to go back in the circulation .
so , in every place , you can get things back .
if you get to this , yes ?
do you remember the win@@ del ?
now , if the garbage is right now .
everywhere , these wind are around , almost .
in the countries where people are getting money .
in the front of the line , but also in the landscape , right ?
if we change the plastics so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the water storage , inside that you can just go back to cell atoms , you can make a baby in israel , in tunisia , 100 hundred hundred trees .
yes ?
in fact , if you take these win@@ del , they destroy , sterile and the powder to make trees .
so , this is a baby positive for the whole life , from the beginning .
so we don &apos;t need to be neutral neutral , we can be positive .
it &apos;s about a serial cable print .
yeah , yeah .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent everything again .
i started a institute .
now , there &apos;s a lot of people working there , and they can all be involved .
now , there &apos;s extra one to put a cra@@ ddle in it .
so not saving more , avoid , avoid , reduce , no school management , but smart waste .
does it matter ?
thank you .
the work of the interpre@@ ting .
music as a language .
in the description of my talk , i wrote that i was an interpre@@ tin , as a translator , in the english vocabulary .
they were interpre@@ ted by the writing notes in clinical music .
that , as a translator , you &apos;re not just a word of word to put the text into a different language , but also to understand the deeper meaning of the words and vocabulary , so that it makes a meaningful translation , everybody knows to do with foreign languages .
in fact , to translate from germans to english , more knowledge can require , if you do , if it &apos;s about connection , or it &apos;s about poetry .
it &apos;s very alien for la@@ ien , but what we do with our music language .
as an interpre@@ ner , i first got the writing notes .
you think the composer is written in the notes exactly everything he &apos;s thought about .
in reality , the notes are very vague and straightforward .
these notes are about the same or not exactly the same , as a verbal verbal , if very , very seemingly accurate , the description of a landscape .
because in this verbal region , the smell of the flowers is not to smell the size of the flowers , not to be able to hear the equivalent of the green , not feeling .
that means , the inventor has to translate to this in@@ accurate language in a different way , which is to translate to it , concrete , non-@@ verbal music language .
today , i would like to give you a picture of what i &apos;m doing , which is , you know , they &apos;re in a verbal language .
so basically a translation of translation .
so i would like to do it all the way to german , because if i have to translate it into english , it would be more important for me to translate the translation of translation .
so , the music works as much as the spoken word language .
the tape notes have the feature of the letters of a script .
so it &apos;s not enough to be able to read just musical notes , and it &apos;s going to sound on the piano on the piano or the right place on a violin .
that &apos;s just the letters you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the sense of the letters is to realize if you can do the language .
so , for the learning process , the music process is at least as long as the word language language .
and then , you can see , you know , whether you learn it for your practice , you can only understand passive , or you can also be active to be able to be able to be able to be able to speak to the musical voice language .
the work of the interpre@@ ted is beginning to be the same as a theater class .
now , after you chose to play a piece , because you &apos;re excited about it , you just study the emergence of the composition .
you collect information on the piece in the high literature .
you read in the letters , you &apos;re reading , notes , notes , or if you have words , thought of the composer itself .
you study the works he made before and after .
you compare .
the reason to write it .
how did he replicate ?
how were its lives , like society and policy ?
all interest me .
you think of it in this time by looking at contemporary images or reading literature .
but with the time , as an interpre@@ ter , you have a rich white knowledge to know the compos@@ ers , and it &apos;s always easier to think in and feel .
the composer is increasingly more to the friend you live with .
his cause to write the piece is becoming more and more of my personal cause to play it .
now , the notes of everything like this is a very accurate record of the composer , but just a framework , i now turn this scaffold to make meaning and meaning .
i then say to my own words , what might be written between this scaffold .
i &apos;m playing what these notes might have .
now for me , for the compos@@ ers , and what they might mean now for him today .
every note , every sentence gets a sense of it , because i feel it , because it comes from my own now .
it &apos;s got to be in the way for me here and now , i can &apos;t convince my audience to do that .
it &apos;s a very happy concert , again , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve been working as long as i was to experience .
how do you see a happy new day , despite the same rituals of life , up , stand up , early kids , go to work , as well as i go back to the new piece again .
i &apos;ve become older again , the seasons change , my pulse goes down in the evening than the morning , in a concert hall , it takes longer that sound comes back home than home .
i &apos;m going to take the breath of the audience , consciously or un@@ consciously .
all that influenced me , and all that influenced me as well .
it &apos;s also a wonderful thing when i stand on the stage , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , targeted conversation .
you get a new idea in it , and you &apos;re going to answer that with a reaction .
it &apos;s interesting , because then things happen that we don &apos;t have , and what you can &apos;t do as well .
it makes great fun to make music in this way , and it &apos;s as the audience , then , as the music communic@@ ates alive .
so each concert is another concert .
i &apos;m not going to play more like this in this moment .
i can &apos;t play as much as in 20 years .
and i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today , and i &apos;m going to have a lot more of my database of music , to emotions and emotions than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have a couple of pieces of paint as well , but i &apos;m going to get some of them .
have a nice example of this .
it was on a piano lawn for music students at my beloved old teacher , professor j@@ s u@@ de , a famous beethoven specialist , in concert t@@ pianist , and long-@@ -year-old professor of the music college .
and unfortunately , i was too young , so that he was em@@ at@@ eri@@ ted when i finally started studying .
but i was very lucky to meet it , very early , with three and a half years , to meet , and so i &apos;ve been in his classes .
i was 17 when i went back to one of his classes in one of his classes , and i played the last from the four balcon@@ es of chopin , one day .
he asked me what the introduction of this bal@@ cra@@ ce was for me .
it &apos;s such a tool .
and in my youth , i said , expectation .
he stood and he said , &quot; what ? &quot;
this must be difference .
because for me , it means memory .
he was about six of them .
well , by 17 , you just have a dream , but no significant memories .
i &apos;m playing the play today every few years , and it used to be turned on for me , although not a single note has changed .
it &apos;s interesting every time , because again i read something new .
an example of a very different area . mon@@ et has painted the se@@ ro@@ sen x .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but at various times time , in different light .
he &apos;s translated the bit@@ s shifts , as he saw her , as she was at this moment .
it &apos;s his personal impres@@ sions .
the x-@@ copenhagen interpretation of a player is comparable to this .
i &apos;m also older than chopin at the same time when he wrote the piece .
he &apos;s lived only nine years .
and i think it &apos;s important to look at the notes again , even though i mean to be conqu@@ ized .
in order to think , just with the composer .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially when he &apos;s died .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
i said , you know , you need about the same term for the spoken word language .
it &apos;s often that the music class is , you know , learning the notes .
you just learn to read first before you just talk a word .
you learn to find the sound on the notes .
if all the finger in time and really like it is moving in the notes , then you get notes that sound like music .
if that happens , the student gets the next difficult piece .
by interpretation , it &apos;s not going to be spoken in the early class .
well , there it is front , it &apos;s a quick piece .
len@@ to , slowly .
it &apos;s like , f and b , etc .
now , most people here .
but also , if you look at these , it &apos;s still a bit of technical technology .
and it &apos;s still not interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget something very fundamental .
because , to make music on the instrument , that your musical musical and feel should be present before .
that &apos;s the singing .
a kid who doesn &apos;t learn the singing because it doesn &apos;t have the parents , it won &apos;t be done by itself .
it &apos;s like learning .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and the idea of the music , then it &apos;s about another possibility , to bring it to sound .
people who never relate to each other , therefore , have never felt the same with your body , as it is to form a sound .
to design a phrase with your own breath .
the music process is the extension of our bodies .
our vocal chor@@ ets to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the ham@@ works are in the piano the sequel of my finger .
the tune comes from the healthy and the rhythm of the dance .
the philippines of apartheid today is not affordable .
you don &apos;t need to make yourself more music if it gets bored .
no longer required to whistle or sing a box .
each of your own music is made , you know , when you get to music all the time .
sure , there are some of you who say , yeah , but what if i can &apos;t sing ?
i think , you can &apos;t sing , a , because you think you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they haven &apos;t learned to sing ?
it &apos;s not too late to try to figure out if you can &apos;t , to learn whether you can &apos;t , or learn how to make these little muscles that are using the vocal set , right .
because you can train that .
or c , because you &apos;ve told them that they &apos;re incomplete .
so , i wonder , what was more competent ?
did you get a second one , or third opinion , as you say it &apos;s beautiful now ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and you want to have ni@@ x .
but what i would say , because music is a beautiful , communic@@ ative thing .
but maybe you can also re@@ vote them .
well , you can see , in all cases , no one has to be an intentional candidate .
but don &apos;t say , please , i don &apos;t understand classical music .
i can &apos;t say if it &apos;s good or bad .
i remember , but sure , you can tell if you like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it &apos;s telling anybody , i don &apos;t know if i can &apos;t cook .
so , they don &apos;t get rid of food , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to get rid of classical music , because they don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen to it , and tell them if it tastes or not .
whether the music is too sweet or too sweet .
tell them what they feel .
at the time , you get to spray , and you want to get something more awesome there , or taste even a difference .
now , why do i ask from my audience to listen to it ?
because the music is a language , and a language is communicating .
a piece of artwork you never look at has no force .
the food that had been cooked by a chef or a chef has to be eaten , not just to look at or have a recipes .
so , please hear if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice sound pete .
if in an environment where adults are making action , or at least active music , it &apos;s growing up , it &apos;s very easy for a music teacher to ask , which color has your flower ?
can you play it in blue now ?
and the kid is playing after a memorial , instead of a red flower .
and this sounds very different .
that was the first beginning of a personal musical expression .
so the first step to an interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today , which is a hundred , 100 hundred years ago , was written ?
now the instruments have moved .
there was no piano at all .
it was just not invented .
i think the stream would have been thrilled when he had the sound of the sound of the modern editor .
i can now see the sound that the stream has had to sound on the modern wing , which is not an c@@ aro@@ vi@@ o .
by beethoven , you know that he listened to more than he had been deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything that a orchestra has not been able to play from then .
and that &apos;s why compos@@ ers depend on us that re@@ mixing the pieces again .
so you &apos;re hearing what you &apos;ve been thinking about .
and also , what you would think about in the mind today .
or what i &apos;m thinking about today , because what you might have thought .
thank you .
you know what &apos;s silent ?
was it necessary ?
and how did this feel ?
suck .
i got a friend who drives a pas@@ ser@@ ati .
when i come , with my little v han@@ es@@ el , and i was wrong with this feeling .
i read something through the head .
i say , p@@ f , what do you need ?
that &apos;s the first half of its value .
and at all , you work much less than me .
why do i have to afford this little car ?
and then immediately , i think , that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , this awkward feeling is gone .
our organism invented a great way of doing such in@@ pleasant feelings , just to move away .
you can also try it with words like revenge or profit , or the equivalent .
i &apos;d like to explain to you this mechanism today , or something that is consciously familiar with you .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but don &apos;t think about the lie , as you may have heard of , if people say , no one has a wall to build .
and then rocks up , so he gives them a point of view .
in such a lie , you see the li@@ ars don &apos;t believe what he says .
it &apos;s easy to see that he has a very different meaning .
it just doesn &apos;t sound it and not itself .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about , that has to do with it , that they decei@@ ved themselves .
they need this lie to make a living lie to get a self-@@ delusion .
they can make them less light , and they can take , you know , shoot or down .
you need time .
from this time , an anec@@ dote that you might know .
the spanish painter p@@ ab@@ lo picasso is actually playing a woman .
now , this woman has gone back , the portrait wouldn &apos;t see her .
picasso says , wait , wait .
it will always be similar to you .
in this place , and if you laugh , you see how important this lie is , and how much time you need to learn something that artists can tell us .
because artists have a broken relationship to lie .
and the artist gives you something , and especially this lady , what you don &apos;t see when you just look inside the mirror .
and the artist gives you a kind of a portrait with something that you &apos;re going to be familiar with when you look at this piece of artwork again .
and then that uncomfortable feeling , it may not look like you , and it will always be similar to you .
here you have this mechanism where we can use the lie as a great invention to stabilize our lives .
and not only in art , in the people , in the people , in the mythology , in stories , comes again .
you may know this idea of the lady that looked at the mirror every morning and asked him , who is the most beautiful in the country ?
one day , this mirrors says , yes , there &apos;s a fair one .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much hosti@@ lity from this real estate , the mirrors can &apos;t lie from this true point .
but we should just be familiar with the fact that you can &apos;t tell a woman to be a fair place somewhere .
here it &apos;s needed to understand what we &apos;re trying to understand , again , and again .
we need to think about this place that holds us into deception , without which we cannot live .
we don &apos;t only have the art in the arts , in the folk literacy , but also in science as great lies .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman of the bis@@ cho@@ ore of wor@@ chester .
she heard about the book of charles darwin , the origin of the species and the cent of people .
that the human being should go from the monkeys , and , yes , at least a common ancestor was between people and apes .
and she ran her to her husband , and she said , &quot; well , that &apos;s not what charles was writing . &quot;
the man should get off the monkeys or have a common ancestor .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to prevent that people get to know .
why do we have to stop that people get insight from something if it &apos;s true ?
because without that life lie , we cannot live .
because we have this self-@@ delusion , this sense of being great , an endangered part of the highest creatures , not from such a kind of natural type of in@@ corre@@ ction , such as an organism that exists still , like this , and whatever things , it &apos;s for us .
so , we can &apos;t smell these things .
we need to prevent that people get knowledge of things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you can see how slowly this mechanism comes up and look like the traces that it &apos;s leaving to something else than in this great image of ourselves , i want to give you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , i mean .
my wife told me .
she came one day from school , she &apos;s a teacher , she was a student .
a autistic student .
they love it especially , because he &apos;s got a slope to it .
and she asked him , what are your hob@@ bies ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire department .
and , because i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in bu@@ g things .
yeah , you feel it when you &apos;re cold at this point . it &apos;s not true .
i said to my wife , always when a person in a moral rule use the word , we should try and replace it by replacing it through the word .
you do that , and then you experience the sentence .
even though i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in pa@@ ro@@ y things .
you feel , that &apos;s the actual truth behind it .
this is a little bu@@ b that doesn &apos;t care about the fire .
they &apos;re interested in fire .
but there &apos;s no one where we can look around where you learn how to make fire .
it &apos;s just the second best , just the fire department .
there it was .
and over that , you don &apos;t say to his teacher , you don &apos;t like to put it somewhere , and you &apos;re excited when the fire gets up after that .
no , it just looks a lot better , if we show that we &apos;re in charge of the risks that others can get when they put fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
this evidence that in the head of bu@@ b already knew that it &apos;s related to the fire , but he can &apos;t say that .
and here you have this editor between the unconscious and the unconscious that jumps immediately , without that you can do something about it , and the things that you know is very much better for you and others .
that &apos;s just the kind of words that we &apos;re using in the language of politically rights speech .
in fact , we know something else is true .
but we know when we talk about that , the social estate is very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do this .
it &apos;s impossible to do things like this in a society that should work .
i want to leave you with what we &apos;ve discovered in my institute .
what logic is this deception , this self-@@ deception , the willingness , a different reality than the one we actually know in the unconscious that it &apos;s valid to spread .
here i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
the first example is ahead of what many of you know , and some of them value , very few of them don &apos;t need at all .
i mean the soul .
what &apos;s the soul ?
the soul is so intellectual , says about lei@@ b@@ ni@@ z .
it &apos;s something which is not stop , tangible nature .
and if you have people who are the strong belief , you have a soul , or you can also say that you have been able to get from the soul to life , and that &apos;s sort of the kind of thing that you might think about , it &apos;s not matter about matter , it &apos;s not matter from the matter of meat and blood , some stone , un@@ important , un@@ important , un@@ important .
and you know , from this soul , you &apos;re sort of thinking that you &apos;re sort of in this clou@@ dy nature , in this tra@@ sty nature , anim@@ a , is in latin , which is present .
and then , if that tra@@ th@@ ine is about the people , it &apos;s filled with it , with mind , with nature that can only live , right with soul .
and then he can walk away .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
so it &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to people .
so we should be able to perceive it as something to be present for our lives .
and if you have this assumption in front of you , then you understand the logic that we &apos;re trying to do with a lie to improve our world .
because now you can apply a team .
you still know from school .
now this is a three-@@ sentence that describes a logic .
this is the hardest part in my talk .
here you need a logic , but you need to lie .
because , to lie , you can just use this logic wrong .
in this three-@@ sentence , three sentences .
the first sentence is , rap , it &apos;s not a soul .
so the second sentence is , if a nice thing is right , it has no soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i put it in particular .
a third sentence that comes up immediately with people who have a strong sense of soul .
they say who doesn &apos;t have a soul who &apos;s dead and cannot claim anything .
and here you feel .
this is where this logic comes from , yes , in this pointing talk .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they are correct .
because i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t matter about reality .
i can say , the canary is a man .
and when i was right , the canary is a man .
if i don &apos;t right , the canary is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a statement about what &apos;s going on .
i can claim everything .
but the key thing is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so , when a nice thing says , there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he has no soul .
these things are correct .
and now our fake consciousness feels immediately , and you can do something .
it &apos;s a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and it does , as if the opposite of the first sentence is already proven and determined .
because actually , we would have to prove whether there &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic that just uses it , that two sentences are correct , and a third thing that looks like it would have to do with it , so we can save our lives of life .
so , we &apos;re doing it as if it &apos;s impossible to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
we can carry these things on different examples .
so , in the presence of the present , we have a modern example of a modern example of the day .
this is what you have to think about , another philosophical subject , a permanent field of philosophy .
it has to do with it that we go back into the fourth century .
there was a scholars called johan@@ nes bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ us , and he named the bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ sche es@@ el .
the bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ dian es@@ el is an es@@ el who is made of nature .
that &apos;s not the soul .
it &apos;s such a natural thing .
and if you place the exact same in the middle between two large hadron tions , he &apos;s star@@ ving .
because he doesn &apos;t know where to go first .
so it &apos;s right in the center .
that &apos;s how the natural things are introduced .
now , big forces with the opposite pre@@ cursor sign of each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
so , only if you take another example , if you immediately take a bunch of things bigger , then it doesn &apos;t need any sense , it doesn &apos;t really need anything .
it &apos;s going on to the right thought .
so , if you have this idea that you &apos;re being driven in nature , you &apos;re being driven by the larger pile that you can put a moment , you also have to feel like you have to get a free one .
and in fact , if we &apos;re here in liberia &apos;s main , i remember the ma@@ x-@@ planning center for brain exploration .
there &apos;s a donation , which is called wolf , and you say , you know , wolf , there &apos;s no freedom .
now we can form the second sentence again , and we can say , if wolf is right , it has no freedom .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and now , what we can read almost every day in the daily newspaper , you find it in this third sentence .
it looks something like that , who don &apos;t have freedom , can also not be moved for its actions and claims to responsibility , and it &apos;s because of it .
again , you have it again .
in fact , you would have to prove that there &apos;s something like welcome freedom .
but the logic of deception allows us to do so , as if the first sentence is wrong , as if you have to test the opposite without evidence .
and now , you can just , if you want to do anything yourself , if you want to test anything , and especially if you want to make people happy , this audac@@ ent to lie .
so , for example , if you look at one person you can say , there &apos;s no previous one .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for prior , which is a mantra .
you don &apos;t have to call it , that would be a little politically correct .
you say , there are no previous ones .
immediately , you &apos;re going to see one of those things , you know , you can &apos;t prove that .
and you have a problem already .
because , while you &apos;re busy doing it , you can tell , you can &apos;t prove that there is no prior , the man is really happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he decei@@ ved it .
because he led her to a ride in which he doesn &apos;t stop himself .
because , in fact , this person isn &apos;t interested in evidence .
it &apos;s just interested in embracing itself in the need of the need to prove that there &apos;s continued to happen .
so , in the kind of transition shift , you see the brilli@@ ity of the lie .
and once again , if you have an opportunity to feel that three-@@ sentence in other people , you do it , because you &apos;re going to make others happy if you don &apos;t remember it .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good day .
i allowed myself to be wondering if i should mention them .
it &apos;s one of the instru@@ ctors here of this great session , and asked me if i gave a lecture here and give my idea .
i have to say , you know , you &apos;ve got it , it was hard to talk about my idea .
and maybe i want to think of my insula project that i &apos;m trying to imagine .
but it &apos;s , of course , the sum , lots of ideas .
i &apos;m probably , you know , the two nice girls still , i &apos;m likely to be part of the generation that &apos;s taken for this bad iron image , because i &apos;ve started to study nine and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half of them , which is , today , i think , kit .
and then i went to berlin in the mid-@@ &apos; 80s years , because i wanted to make renewable energy , and i didn &apos;t have it .
there was the core research system .
that was , then , all the k@@ fa , including k@@ fa .
the hot project today .
because a good engineer has either built great cars or nuclear power plants .
but this kind of do@@ of@@ es like &quot; n solar pen@@ del , from the kind of hundred watts from the square square , that was a toy .
and in berlin , there was an unfair engineering collective .
i &apos;m grateful that he &apos;s grateful for the word to put the word back again , because after the man , you couldn &apos;t use the word , because everything left was bad .
however , this was not like this in the 1950s .
and it was a way that it was self-@@ managed , and one of them was sitting in por@@ berg , and one of them was in por@@ berg , where you were familiar with evil .
in the end of terror , but that was called c@@ tr@@ tr@@ onics and made wind and solar energy , and i started in the mid-@@ 80s .
and yeah , many of what was said today touches me , because many , many beautiful expressions that i &apos;ve been through .
i &apos;ve been working 11 years in the collective , that was grassroots .
we were twenty people .
in fact , if one said , the god@@ op@@ be@@ zip , it &apos;s got a very ru@@ ck , and i &apos;ve been very hard to do it for 10 years , and i &apos;m really interested in what &apos;s going on in my father &apos;s mind , because all of my father &apos;s colleagues have been talking to him , you &apos;ve got the money out to the window .
it &apos;s engaging with failures .
and it was really , very banal , and it &apos;s going to go into it in such a place where i was going to see a picture where i was about 10 years old , a thousand , a thousand mark , of course , of course , if it should be that great .
and i went back to six and a half of them , and then we &apos;ve become with friends with friends in the company , which then became , along with the sp@@ in-@@ off off off of the world .
and , of course , a massive statement story , but , of course , we have the problem of a growing company , and we have two thousand , a small group , decided that we will start again again and go back and go back to the next topic of the future , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen to us , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on , we &apos;re talking about saving .
and i brought to you a project that i want you to imagine .
and the title of the talk was , you know , how you get to 100 percent renewable .
and we just started asking with a relatively simpler crazy story , where you might have a memory of memory today .
on this island , this is the island gra@@ ci@@ o@@ sa on the az@@ ors .
yeah , that &apos;s the data .
there are four and a half thousand people .
they have an renewable amount of renewable energy today .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
this is simply not technological .
if you build more wind force , the system starts to fail .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m telling you about the politicians , if you &apos;re in ber@@ lin@@ -@@ ad@@ ler@@ ess of our facility .
they always say , why ?
we &apos;ve got 20 percent in germany .
it can &apos;t be a problem .
but not , we have seven percent in europe , and our network is physically central to the european .
if we had 20 percent , we &apos;ve had the same problems that people have on this island .
and the question was just , you know , it was two thousand@@ thousand@@ 2006 , the first contact with the island , but , you know , it was just .
how big would you have to be so a battery , so you have an island to 20 , 30 , four , 50 , perhaps 70 percent renewable renewable .
and yeah , i &apos;ll go on a slide again .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , a year of about a hundred giga@@ watts of electrical power is built on an extreme basis in the world .
it &apos;s because of a hundred nuclear power power , because it &apos;s very fast everywhere .
the energy hunger in the world , which is going to happen , is di@@ wed by this , because you don &apos;t need permission .
this is fast .
you put it in a box .
and then it looks like this .
in fact , three and a half of them are always waiting to wait .
yeah , it looks like this is the load .
we also have very straightforward data .
and the wind plant or the solar facility , or whatever it is , is , in fact , a brick system is a system that can only feed into small amounts here .
our goal was just to say , okay .
that el will be bent and the wind , the sun uses the load so that they can form the greater percentage .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , energy per year , not the performance at the moment , then you have to switch off that el .
that is , in the moment , you have to worry that renewables can actually take the whole net .
now , you can only , of course , be in some way , in some way .
this hasn &apos;t done so much in the world .
this is in the little style , so you can use them in the car for a small fight .
people always ask me , what do you research in , because actually , in ad@@ school sh@@ of ?
it &apos;s already happening .
but if you want several of these trade-offs to connect together and build a network , it &apos;s extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to get 2@@ 70 percent renewable renewable , and then there &apos;s this rest , the last two , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , which will be very , very expensive , and that &apos;s not going to work , and that &apos;s not going to work out of batteries either .
it &apos;s going to be an energy amount of energy , which is , you know , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you know , it will be .
you have to go to a seasonal store , and winter summer , and not just the same night .
we just wanted to know , what is a normal , ink electric chemical battery .
how far do you get there ?
and then they did a whole lot of simulation .
and you have wind and sun and the load , and you have the result , a very interesting result , that you have to go to the conventional system , which is , after 20 years , needed a middle stream of about 50 cents per watt hour , about four cents .
these were the first compu@@ tations six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper like the portable system , if the richest price rises five percent a year .
and then we started negotiating the rebel@@ lan@@ s .
what would be done ?
when i was using investors , i &apos;ve been looking for new pathogens .
we were only five people at the time to rebuild the society again .
and here &apos;s the plot again .
the bra@@ d is the conventional system , the green is our system .
that our system also has increased a price , because we &apos;re still doing 20 percent with this , and we don &apos;t have an increase on the other things .
and the power tivo that &apos;s going on on the atmosphere on the island has meant that we find this great .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the technical problem .
and that &apos;s why we decided to build a hall in berlin in which we can kind of create the electric portion of the island at three very much .
that means we first looked at the biggest battery in the world .
here it is .
it comes from asia , in the case of japan .
and in fact , it &apos;s in the late &apos; 70s , in the late &apos; 70s , at the bbc village , and it &apos;s been developed today , and then licen@@ ged to the japanese .
you can see , it &apos;s a very , very big battery .
it &apos;s got a mega@@ c performance , and it can take that performance for six hours , and that &apos;s the battery that we have kind of got comedy .
and then put them in .
we &apos;ve also got one of these ancient dishes in the same size , which is , in fact , putting the entire dynamic behavior from this network , so in the hall , it looks like this , in the back , here &apos;s the big battery , and here &apos;s the whole , the whole battery , that we can simulate the net .
over here , we &apos;re going to simulate the whole consumer mission system , the circular physics of the cable , to put the vibra@@ tion on the web .
and you can see here again .
we can also shift two hundred kilo@@ watts of photovol@@ ta@@ ics on the net .
here we see this again again , again , the same thing , again , the whole one .
and what we &apos;ve done , for two and a half of the nine , has been done in the hall , until today two thousand 12 , everything that was going on between the individual system of electronics , we made software .
so we &apos;re not a pandemic maker , but we define ourselves as a company , which is only between the subject of battery and the issue and everything in between .
you have to communicate to the battery , of course , you have to communicate into the web , and it &apos;s very complicated .
so the nice thing about this is that , in this island , you can basically take care of everything that we &apos;re going to get when we want to increase our share of renewables .
so this whole discussion , how is it going to move back and move , energy turn , like this , on the island , for example , in the island , for example , to 50 percent of energy energy , so we feed the wind and the sun .
natural light is then a smart metric .
so , smart mapping , a huge issue everywhere .
we can start to integrate the island in the island , to try to integrate electro@@ mobility , to ask , you can do the load .
that means when you &apos;re 70 percent renewable , you &apos;re not going to do that without memory .
you can &apos;t be able to be able to go through the ground , and you can do it by building nets , yes , you should be able to hear the percentage , but you can never get rid of memory .
and that &apos;s the message .
that &apos;s why many people , and look at this , just because you can see what you get .
if we switch down that el , you don &apos;t have this rotating mass that causes a certain kind of iner@@ tia on the net .
and our european migr@@ atory network is essentially made of almost the most powerful mass of big power plants , where the wave is all around europe .
we look into this grid , see the 50 hertz , and when it &apos;s nine and a half of them , we &apos;re going to start making a few months , then a little mer@@ b goes back , then we come back .
this is the system .
and of course , this is an incredible deadline .
if you tear this down somewhere , it takes some time .
it &apos;s at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in time , they can respond again .
if you don &apos;t have that , that rotating mass , then you have to replace that with the use of productivity and electro@@ chemistry .
and what we can do with this big battery is to turn two milliseconds into it .
and then you see the enormous speed of opportunity there .
and the message is , we have to get rid of these ro@@ ggling masses , if we are kind of our goals 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 , 30 percent , and so on , if we all want to reach .
then we have to cut our mu@@ st-@@ run capacity on the net .
so , mu@@ st-@@ run is simply , the power runs to keep the frequency .
yeah , it &apos;s a huge debate at the moment , building the coal force , because we don &apos;t otherwise , or ga@@ tz , because that &apos;s not going to happen .
and we &apos;re just trying to make sure that you can get the capacity , the mu@@ st-@@ run capacity , can break up by using electric chemical storage .
there &apos;s now a lot of studies now .
and then , at this point , people always come and look at our experimenter , which is basically our ancestry .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of how far you can take away a piece of the future .
and many discussions i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion that i had in the last 30 years in the last 30 years .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s bad , child play stuff , we &apos;ve got everything , we will never include .
we have 30 giga@@ watts today in germany .
that &apos;s what it is .
and i just assume that in the next 30 years , we &apos;re going to have the same capacity in electro@@ chemical store around the world .
it &apos;s very simple , it will come .
there will be so many of these kinds of immigrants and arguments .
the nice thing is , i &apos;ve experienced sort of the last two years in the last two years that scientists are looking at my side .
we &apos;ve now got about 10 million funding projects , also , in order to climb in the german net .
this is going to happen in april .
so , from this point , you also notice that there is a change there , and it &apos;s just from this treat@@ ance position , to the idea , a hundred percent renewable .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like an au@@ tar@@ ar system .
and so far , in discussions , it &apos;s always trying to do , you know , these jewel@@ lan@@ ans , they &apos;re doing au@@ tar@@ k , they have a little bit of a small net , which has to do with our own and nothing .
the question is , it &apos;s quite easy , if you &apos;re completely independent from some of the fossil or ancient energy that are going to release somewhere in the world and get to them , you &apos;re an island .
then you only use what you are in the sun and wind where you live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of our vision of an ad@@ literacy power supply , and i &apos;m also grateful that they used to use solar energy .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and we &apos;re going to see , as well , the talk of storms to be a collective , that again you can be a collective and solar energy , a little bit together .
and yeah , i just want to encourage you , in the sense that you can be a little crazy and you can have a vision .
and you really have to be pretty tough , but i think it &apos;s going to happen .
thank you .
when steve lo@@ pe@@ z , colom@@ n@@ ist is the los angeles times , one day through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , sympathy , ra@@ u , homeless , homeless , who had just had two other strings .
now , many of you will know the story , because in ste@@ ves articles , later , a book was later called , with robert spiel@@ ney junior , as steve lo@@ pe@@ z junior , as steve lo@@ pe@@ z and jo gover@@ x , who studied in the first morning of his parach@@ ids schizophrenia .
nathaniel stepped out of ju@@ illi@@ ard , a nerve breakdown and 30 years later , he lived as homeless as homeless in the streets of sk@@ id row in the center of los angeles .
i suggest to all of you to read the book , or to look at the film , so you can &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness that was made between these two men , but also how the music made this connection , and as it ended up making the instrument , if this word is allowed , it allows you to get it from the street .
i met mr. a@@ yers in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney block@@ hall .
he had just heard a demo of beethoven &apos;s first and four@@ ter , and came behind the stage to imagine me .
he spoke in a very sacred and social note about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton , and how the dodgers would never create it in the baseball world series , and all of this because of the most pressing passage of the first mind in the last sentence of beethoven &apos;s four .
we went on to talk about music , and a few days later , i got an email in which norway was interested in the class of mine .
i &apos;ve also got to say that nathaniel has been treated a medical treatment , because he had been treated with electro@@ sho@@ ine and do@@ a@@ ine and hand@@ na@@ ws , a trauma that has been his whole life .
now , as a result , he &apos;s particularly susceptible to these schizophren@@ ic stages , and they &apos;re so bad , and he went away from the streets of sk@@ id row , always exposed to this horror and the result of his own mind .
and , in the same way , sudhir , when we were at the first class of our first class , in walt disney guer@@ hall , he started to get this very ru@@ cer in his eyes and was completely lost .
he was talking about invisible mon@@ en and smoke and about how someone wanted to poison him in sleep .
i was scared , not mine , but i was afraid i could lose him in one of his states , and that i could destroy his relationship to the violin , if i started talking about clay and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ y and other exciting forms of di@@ da@@ cal practices .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s violin concert .
and while i was playing , i noticed that in na@@ th@@ ani@@ o , it was a complete change .
it was like he was under the impact of an invisible doctor , a chemical reaction , whose cataly@@ or was my play .
na@@ th@@ ani@@ o anger turned into understanding , in a calm curiosity and courage .
and , like by a miracle , he took his mind , and he began to play some of the dis@@ missions of viol@@ in@@ concert , and then asked me to play it : men@@ del@@ s@@ son , t@@ hi@@ i@@ ko@@ w@@ ski , si@@ be@@ li@@ us .
and then we started talking about music , starting by bach about beethoven , bra@@ ms , bru@@ ck@@ ner and all the other , from bar@@ t@@ k to es@@ a-@@ pe@@ k@@ ka sal@@ ons .
and i realized that he was not just an encyclopedia knowledge about music , but it was also a very tight personal relationship .
he was talking about her with a passion and a sense that i &apos;d only known about my colleagues in the e.u. of los angeles .
by playing music , and he was talking about music , from this parano@@ ids , confused man , who was just moved by the streets of los angeles , a bright , educated , well-@@ minded musician .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel , music means music health .
because the music allows him to re@@ form his thoughts and delu@@ sions with his imagination and creativity into something real .
and so he &apos;s going to move his comfort states .
i understood that exactly this is the nature of art .
so this is the reason why we do music , so we do something that &apos;s within all of us , deep , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity to reality .
and the reality of that expression is all of us , and it &apos;s moving , inspired and together .
what sudhir was doing , it brought the music back into a community of friends .
the rules of music brought it back into a family of musicians who understood his talent and invited him .
and i &apos;m going to leave you with plutonium music , whether in the walt disney guer@@ hall or sk@@ id row , because he reminds me why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruno gi@@ us@@ san@@ i : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i have stolen the c@@ elli@@ ist .
i hope you forgive me .
so i was in my life a lot of fish .
i just loved two .
this first one , that was more like a passionate beast .
it was a beautiful fish , well-@@ educated , good consisten@@ cy , private , a man on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was raised in aqu@@ ac@@ ul@@ dom after the highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel like selling it .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
one day , the ceo of the company was calling , and asked if i could carry on a event on the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to solve what was this unimaginable problem for our coo@@ ks , and how do we keep fish on our menu ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve planted the oceans as we cut forests .
it &apos;s hard to over@@ rate the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tunas , the healing , the mer@@ x , heavy fish , they &apos;re collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , you know , or bad aqu@@ ac@@ ul@@ tic , we &apos;re going to be a part of our future .
there &apos;s a lot of argument about it . and the environment will contamin@@ ate the environment , the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna .
it has a food supply of 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds of wild fish is required to get a pound tuna .
not very sustainable .
don &apos;t taste very well .
so finally , here was a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to support them .
the day before , i called the head of public labor for the company .
let &apos;s watch it .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous to build so far in the ocean that you don &apos;t contamin@@ ate the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said , &quot; we &apos;re so far outside that the waste of our fish is distributed , not focused . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re essentially a world .
and these foods from the cassini to one , he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
fast-forward to one , great .
&quot; helios to one ? what is it ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . let me .
and i was in bed this evening , and i thought , what to hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , just before the event , don &apos;t .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t listen , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he doesn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to ask .
well , i &apos;m calling a few people in the company , and nobody could give me a proper answer , until i finally end up with the sharp biologists .
we also don &apos;t call it listening .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; what for example are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some fish , and then he said , chicken pel@@ lets .
i said , &quot; chicken pel@@ lets ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , fea@@ thers , skin , bone fl@@ fl@@ s , dri@@ ps , dri@@ gged and to feed food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of food is chicken ? &quot;
the assumption of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t i know what &apos;s sustainable to feed chicken to fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the board , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i loved from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a self-@@ righ@@ tating and benign person .
i &apos;m even .
no , i really love the fish from this fish , because , you know , i swear to god , the fish has fallen after this conversation .
this second fish , this is a different kind of romance story .
it &apos;s the romantic way , the way you know , the better you know your fish , you love the fish more .
i was eating him in a restaurant in southern spain .
a friend of mine was talking about this fish for a long time .
it &apos;s got to us in a way .
he came to the table with a bright white color .
the chef had cooked him .
twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can leave a fish so well after he was cooking ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
let &apos;s call him mi@@ gu@@ el . in fact , he &apos;s mi@@ gu@@ el .
and no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef . at least in the way that you and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at od@@ a la pal@@ ma .
this is a fish in the southern northwest of spanish .
it &apos;s close to the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of argent@@ ine@@ ans .
they were breeding meat cattle , which was basically wetlands .
they did this by making the country off .
they built this complicated episode of channels , and they made water out of the country and out in the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not economically .
and organic was a catastrophe .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds , what the place of many birds are .
and so 1982 has bought a spanish company with environmental consciousness .
what do they do ?
they have the flow of the water .
they literally laid the lever .
instead of putting the water out , they used the channels to pull the water back .
they beat the channels .
they created a 1@@ 1,000 acres of fish -- bar@@ sch , mermaid , shrimp , a@@ al -- and , in fact , mi@@ gu@@ el , and his company , the ecological destruction completely evolves .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
they &apos;re staring at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see is flu@@ ched channels and density , lower march .
i was not a long time at mi@@ gu@@ el .
it &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin , and a piece of &quot; a crocodile to kiss . &quot;
okay ? there we were , and we fought through the wetlands , and i was shaking and shaking , and i got ma@@ w up to my knees , and mi@@ gu@@ el is keeping a biology class .
here he picks up a rare barrier .
now , it &apos;s called the mineral needs of phy@@ top@@ lankton .
and here , here he looks at a pattern of tunnels that reminds him to the generation giraffe .
it turns out that mi@@ gu@@ el spent the most significant part of his career in mik@@ um@@ i park in africa .
i asked him how he became such a fish expert .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes into more talking about rare birds and algae and weird water plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the bio@@ tic community , in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head got weak about this kind of rotten piece of fish that i was at night .
so i quit him . i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , how does your fish get so good ? &quot;
he showed up the algae .
&quot; i know boy , the algae , the phy@@ top@@ lankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what do you eat ?
what is the value ? &quot;
now , he continues to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system , that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild .
the bio@@ biomass , the phy@@ top@@ lankton , the zo@@ op@@ lankton , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-@@ designed .
there &apos;s no food .
the one in a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
after the day , i went around with mi@@ gu@@ el , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be like , &quot; different than any farm i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you measure ? &quot;
in the moment , as if a film director would require a stage shift .
and we bow around the corner , and we mate the most amazing sight , thousands and thousands and thousands of pinker , literally , an innov@@ ating carpet so far .
&quot; that &apos;s successful , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your colorful , pink .
they freak out . &quot;
poor ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , don &apos;t you throw your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yeah , &quot; he said .
&quot; we &apos;re losing 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds .
now , last year , there were 60@@ 0,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s the largest and one of the most important private bird reserves in europe .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , is a good animal , not the last one you &apos;d like to have on a fish ? &quot;
he put his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building defen@@ sively , not harder .
this is an environmental network .
the fl@@ vels are eating the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phy@@ top@@ lankton .
so the renaissance , the tent , the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink this . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that measures their success on the health of their predators .
a fish , but also a bird reserve .
oh , and by the way , these fl@@ unds should not be there .
they breed in a town of 240 miles away where the soil quality is better for nest maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance
every morning they fly 240 miles to farm .
and every night , they go back 240 miles .
they &apos;re doing this because they can follow the melting white line of the country a@@ 92 .
seriously .
i was introduced to the penguins of penguins , so i looked at mi@@ gu@@ el .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , you fly 240 miles to the farm , and then you fly back a thousand miles back ?
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me as he would have just a song on the whitney .
he said , &quot; no . you do it because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my loved fish that was delicious , and i don &apos;t like fishing . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s the end , forced taste .
i almost never cooked with it .
and yet , when i tried in this restaurant in southern spain , it didn &apos;t take it to fish .
she liked sweet and in it , as if you would take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned this to mi@@ gu@@ el , and he was no@@ cked .
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a spon@@ ge .
it &apos;s the last piece of defense before something comes to the body .
it &apos;s evolved in evolution in the course of evolution to go back . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water doesn &apos;t have an un@@ locked . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their fish . a farm that will determine their success for success .
and then , i realized , if he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have an in@@ medi@@ ing , it &apos;s massive , because the water that comes through this farm comes from the river gu@@ ad@@ al@@ i .
it &apos;s a river that &apos;s going to take all the things with these rivers , and these rivers are tend to lead them to , to lead chemical pollutants .
and if it &apos;s fought by the system , and this leaves is clean , as it comes from .
the system is so healthy , it cle@@ ans water .
so not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that &apos;s going to measure their success on the health of their predators , but a farm that is literally a water supply facility , not just for you and me .
because when the water flows out , it goes down in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and i &apos;m going to take it , because this love story , like romantic , is also emerging .
you could say it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food , whether we talk about barefoot or meat cattle .
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , from one where food actually tastes good .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little too radical .
we &apos;re not realistic , we &apos;re enjoying it . we &apos;re a lover .
we love jewish markets . we love little family stores . we &apos;re talking about local food . we eat organic .
and if you claim that the things that the future makes good food is somebody &apos;s standing somewhere and says , &quot; hey , people , i love pin@@ ke , but how will they feed the world ?
how will they feed the world ? &quot;
may i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not because we &apos;re producing enough calories to feed the world more than only food .
one billion people are hungry today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of kr@@ ine@@ ans in the distribution , not the overall production .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because , you know , the logic of our food system has been about the last 50 years .
you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , we &apos;re getting more people to plant predators , convul@@ sions of mono@@ chemi@@ ders , chemicals on earth , and all the time the agricultural industry has just asked , &quot; if we feed more people , how awful can this be ? &quot;
that was the cause . it was the legal process . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a industries in ab@@ pa@@ stion , a industry , which is fast for environmental capital to allow that production to use .
this is not an industry , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our grain forest is threatened today , not because of the dis@@ count of resources .
not by the latest ne@@ d and tra@@ ctor invention , but through fertile land , not pumps , but through fresh water , not by shipping water , not by the courts , not by fishing boats and nets , but through fishes and nets .
they want to feed the world ?
so let &apos;s start with the question : how will we feed ourselves ?
or better , how do we create conditions that enable any community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agricultural model for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry , chemistry , and machines are on top of it , and it has never made good good for food .
let &apos;s look at the ecological model instead .
that &apos;s what &apos;s happening to two billion years of labor .
look at mi@@ gu@@ el , farmers like mi@@ gu@@ el .
businesses that are not the worlds for themselves , businesses that are re@@ creating instead of building , businesses , that are growing , rather than just intense , farmers that are not only created , but experts for relationships .
because they are the ones that are also experts for taste .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better cook than i &apos;ll ever be .
you know , it &apos;s right to me , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
so , if i want to give you one thing today , the amount of data that we consume is bigger than the sum of their parts , and rather than the sum of their parts , i want them to think about how we can use information so that we can use patterns that are otherwise not visible .
so , what we see here is a typical facial diagram .
the program i use here is a small experiment .
it &apos;s called spades and what i can do with a certain cause of death , we can tell accidents .
and instantly , i see another pattern that makes it happen .
it &apos;s because in the middle area here , people are most active , and they &apos;re over here .
we can move a step further , and we can see the data new , and we can see that the disease and cancer is the usual , but not for everybody .
now , if we go to the next , we &apos;re going to see 40 years , or younger , we see that accidents are actually the main issue that people should worry about .
and who continues to see that this is particularly true of men .
so , you can see that looking at information and data in this way is remembered to swim in a living information graph .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not for content itself ?
now what we have now is the title images of every single sport , which has ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it for my talk in your rooms .
with spades , you can dive into a decade .
you can dive into a particular year .
you can jump directly to a certain issue .
now , if i look at this , i see the athletes that appear in this issue and the sporting species .
i &apos;m a lan@@ ce armstrong fan , so i click here , and i &apos;m going to show all of the expen@@ ders in which lan@@ ce armstrong is mentioned .
now , if i want to take a look at it , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything to drive ? &quot;
so i take a step back and further the perspective .
now i see greg le@@ mond .
and so you get an idea that if you look at this kind of information , more powerful , broader , zoom in , zoom out , you don &apos;t expect or not just sur@@ end .
you do something that &apos;s actually slightly different .
it &apos;s something in between , and we think it &apos;s changing the way information can be used .
i want to take this idea a bit further with something which is a bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single wiki , and we put them on a small summary .
the summary has a short over@@ view and a symbol of it coming from .
i &apos;ll just show the top 500 of the most popular wikipedia .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get a sense of the issues that are most popular on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to vote on government .
now , after i voted in &apos; government , i know that the wikipedia , in fact , that it &apos;s a time called &quot; people of the year . &quot;
this is really important because this is a realization that &apos;s not in a single earthquake .
it &apos;s just to recognize if you go back and looked at it .
looking at a certain of these summar@@ ies , i can then go into the issue of time magazine , &quot; people of the year , &quot; and all together .
now , if i look at all these people , i know the majority of them are government officials . some of them come from science . some , even less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss . and one comes from the music .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
so we can jump and look at all the ted prize winners .
you see , we &apos;re surfing in the net , the first time it &apos;s a network , not just from page to page , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise might be .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
i mean , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites with every single website like this .
so i can go back to a step , and just jump to a specific section .
so this is important because you &apos;re just looking at the view of the websites in this way , and the whole internet course can look at the same way .
so i can zoom in in a certain time frame .
here &apos;s the entire demonstration of the entire demonstration that i &apos;ve been making here .
and i can kind of see everything i &apos;ve been looking back at today .
and , again , if i take a step out and look at everything , i can re@@ arrange my lab , perhaps after my search past , here , and here , i &apos;ve been looking for it , you know , paste , or here to live labs .
and from here i can go into the site and call it again .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used over and over again , and every time it makes it larger than the sum of the data .
right now , in this world , we think that data is a flight .
we &apos;re talking about the flow of information .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drowning in information . &quot;
what if we could turn this situation and put the internet on the head so that instead of going from one to the other , we &apos;re starting to go from many things to many things , and seeing patterns that would be otherwise hidden ?
if we can do this , this is the previous data case , perhaps a new source of information .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge from it .
and if we know , maybe we can even get out of it .
so i &apos;m listening , thank you very much .
i grew up with a shepherd high science fiction .
in my high school , i went to school to school every day every day .
and my nose used to be in a book , a science fiction book , which led my thoughts to other worlds , and in a narrative , my deep curiosity , satisfied .
and that curiosity also showed that , if i was not in school , through the forests , walking and traveled , and &quot; samples , &quot; frogs and snakes and bugs and mol@@ ches of water took home and looked underneath the microscope .
i was totally excited about science , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and the boundaries of the possible .
and my love to science fiction seemed to be impac@@ ted in my environment , because in the late &apos; 60s , we went to the moon and we were exploring the deep sea .
jacques cou@@ ste@@ au came in our living rooms with his fascinating shows of animals and places and places of wonder that we &apos;d never imagined before .
now , that &apos;s really good at the point of science fiction .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there &apos;s no video games yet with computer-@@ generated films with computer-@@ generated films in the media landscape , i had to create the pictures in my head .
that was what we all had to do . when we read a book , we took the description of the au@@ ire and put them on the canvas in our heads .
my response to this was the drawing and painting of aliens , alien worlds , robots , space ships and all this stuff .
in the math class , i was always caught by teachers , as i was in hiding back in the textbook .
creativity had to look somehow .
and something interesting happened , which is , because what fascinated me from jacques cou@@ ste@@ on shows , was the thought of an entirely unknown world on our earth itself .
certainly , i would never be able to reach an alien world with a spaceship , which seemed pretty unlikely to me .
but here was a world i was actually able to walk here on earth , and it was as fascinating and exotic as all of what i had ever imagined when i read these books .
so i decided when i was 15 .
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , 10,000 miles away from the nearest ocean .
i wasn &apos;t going to let myself .
i made my father , until he finally had a saturday school in buffalo , new york , out@@ made , just on the other side of the border where we lived .
i was making my submersible in a pool of 79 in the middle of the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , but a real ocean , i got only two years later when we moved to california .
since , in the 40 years , in the 40 years , that &apos;s the point , i &apos;ve spent about 10,000 hours of water , 500 hours in submer@@ boats .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flat oceans , is as rich as a result of amazing life , as we really can &apos;t imagine .
nature &apos;s imagination don &apos;t know boundaries , very much , unlike our own , denial human imagination .
until the day , i feel deep awe for what i see on my submersible .
and my love to the ocean lasts with the same intensity as ever and ever .
when i was looking for a job , it was a paper .
that seemed the best way to tell my inner mind to tell stories with my need to build images .
i used to draw comic books as a kid .
so , films were the way of bringing images and stories together . that &apos;s together .
of course , the stories i was looking for , from the science fiction sphere , &quot; termin@@ ator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; aby@@ ss . &quot;
in the aby@@ ss , i was able to connect my pre@@ ference to the underwater world and connect to the filmmakers .
so basically my two passions .
something interesting happened in the aby@@ ss : to solve a narrative problem in this film -- and we had to create such a kind of liquid water -- we went back to computer-@@ generated animation , c@@ g , c@@ g .
what came out of this was the first computer-@@ generated software interface character that was ever in a film .
the film didn &apos;t get a money , in fact , he just played his production costs , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world was mes@@ eri@@ zed by the magic .
according to arthur clar@@ ke &apos;s law , we don &apos;t know more advanced technology and magic .
so they saw something magic .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this must be used to work in the movie art . &quot;
so we went to &quot; termin@@ ator 2 , &quot; my next film , much further .
so with il@@ m , we created the guy out of liquid metal , and the success was completely like this effect .
and it worked . again , we created something magic , and the effect in the audience was the same . but we &apos;ve been playing a bit more .
from these two experiences , it was a very new world , a very new world of creativity for film making film .
so , i started a company , with my good friend stan win@@ ston , who was the best of the best ma@@ ke of the world , and it was called &quot; digital fisher . &quot;
the idea of this company was , the phase of the analog processes with visual printing pressure , etc .
that was what we did , and then we made a competitive advantage .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the capacity of the capacity and cad design -- which we actually started the company -- too slow .
i had written this piece &quot; avatar , &quot; which is the textile of visual effects and computer-@@ generated effects in new heights , with realistic human , expressive characters that were made by c@@ g , and the main figures should be c@@ g . and the world should be c@@ g .
but the tra@@ ck hit pretty much , and the people in my company told me that we &apos;re not able to be able to create that .
so i moved that , and i made this other film about the big ship .
the film studio , i was selling this as &quot; rome@@ o and ju@@ lie@@ t on a ship . &quot; it became a romance film , a passionate movie .
now , prisoner , i wanted to go down to the real ride of the titanic .
that &apos;s why i made the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
but i convinced them , i said , &quot; we &apos;re diving to the train . we film the real ride .
we &apos;re going to show it in the open sequence of the film .
it &apos;s very important . it &apos;s a good job for marketing . &quot;
and i told them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but it goes back to that that your imagination can create reality .
and then , in fact , we created six months later , a reality where i found myself in a russian submersible , four miles below the surface of the northern atlantic , and i was looking at the real titanic through a beating eye .
this was not a film , no h@@ d , that was real .
so , that really blew me .
and it was enormous , and we needed to build cameras and light lights and all kinds of things .
and what i noticed was how much of these deep sea walks , a space mission .
well , they were also highly organic , and they were also highly empowered .
you go up into this capsule , you &apos;re walking into this dark , hostile environment , where no hope is to rescue , if you don &apos;t get it back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i was in a science fiction film .
it &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was really obsessed with the study of the deep sea .
anyway , the piece of curiosity and science to do , it was all . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that i couldn &apos;t give hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could create a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside of the window .
in some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in thermal sources , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , and for the science when we saw them , had no words yet .
so that &apos;s got me off , and i wanted to get more .
and so i met a slightly unusual decision .
after the titanic of &quot; titanic &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my job as a filmmaker in hollywood in hollywood , and i &apos;m going to get full-time researchers for a while . &quot;
and then we started studying &quot; bis@@ mar@@ ck , &quot; and we studied them with robotic experiences .
we went back to the titanic of the titanic .
we took small robots that we built a fi@@ ber@@ glass cable .
our purpose was to dive in and look at the inside of what was never done before .
no one had ever explored the inner speed . you had no means for it . so we developed the technology .
now , i &apos;m sitting there , on the deck of the titanic , in a submersible , and you see plankton that are very similar to this bre@@ il , and i know that once the band was playing there .
and i &apos;m going to fly with a little robotic experience of the ship .
i mean , it &apos;s really just , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically living inside of the ship &apos;s circle of the titanic .
this was the sur@@ original form of an d@@ é@@ j@@ -@@ v@@ u , which i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i was in a corner , i knew i knew what was going on in the light of the vehicle , because i ran the film .
the set was a very accurate copy of the building plans of the ship .
so this was a very strange experience .
it made me realize that this tele@@ test experience , you know , that you use these robotic interfaces , and your mind in the vehicle , in this other form of existence .
it was really quite profound .
and maybe a small way to look at what might happen in a few decades , if you have a germ body , to explore something or to do other things , in all kinds of post-@@ human@@ ities that i can think of as science fiction .
after these expeditions , we started to think about what we &apos;ve seen down there , for example , this deep subtle , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals , which are kind of alien , but here on earth .
they &apos;re living with chemo@@ synthesis .
they don &apos;t exist in an sunlight system , as we do .
and so you see animals that are right next to a 500 degree centigrade that they can survive there .
at the same time , i was also interested in space science , which was again the science fiction effect from my childhood .
and so i ended up on the people who are interested in space , and they have to do with nasa , and in nasa &apos;s verbal literature , and they go to russia , and they go to russia , and they go to russia , and they go to the international space proto@@ f , and they take our 3d camera systems .
that was fascinating .
but in the end , it was because i went to space science with us in the deep sea .
and i took them , and i gave them access to the world , astro@@ biologists , planetary scientists , people who became interested in these extreme situations , and i took them to the sources , so they could take samples and test and test instruments and test and so on .
we made documentary films , but we did science , but in fact , space science .
so , the circle between my existence was the science fiction fan , as a child , and the challenge to reality .
i learned a lot about this process of discovery .
i learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure now , you know , a director has to be able to be able to do a ship or something like ship .
i didn &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before i joined these expeditions .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do this ? what &apos;s coming out ? &quot;
these dumb films don &apos;t bring us a cash .
we &apos;re just playing the production cost . it &apos;s not a clue .
everybody thinks i went away between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and i would have washed the lights on a towel .
i have all these films , these documentary films , made for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re doing it in order to become the challenge of the challenge , and the ocean is the most challenging environment that you have . you &apos;re doing it , because of the weird connection that comes when a small group of people create a team .
because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people who worked out for years , and sometimes we were two to three months back .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the warning that you have in front of each other , because you have a problem that you can &apos;t explain any other .
if you go back to land and say , &quot; we needed to do it , the fi@@ ber@@ glass , the sound , and all the way around , the whole technology , and the difficulty that you can &apos;t explain to the other . that &apos;s how you can &apos;t explain it . that &apos;s how you can never explain it .
it creates a connection , a mutual respect .
so when i went back to turn to my next film &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to apply the same leadership style , which is that you &apos;re being respected by your team and in the end of your respect .
so the dynamic was really changing .
so , i stood again with a small team on un@@ familiar terrain . we made &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that hasn &apos;t been there before .
so exciting .
it &apos;s an enormous challenge .
and we got to a real family for a four and a half years .
it changed my way of making films completely .
there were people who thought we would have been doing these ocean creatures really well on the planet p@@ and@@ ora .
for me , it was more inclusive to do my job , the actual process that changed .
so what can we do ?
what do we learn ?
i think , first of all , the curiosity is .
it &apos;s the most powerful human trait .
our imagination is a force that can actually create reality .
and the state of your team is more important than all the lor@@ dge of the world .
to me , young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me a advice , like i can do . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t join yourself .
you get others for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , bet not against yourself , but take risks for you . &quot;
nasa has such an amazing sentence : &quot; failure is not alternative . &quot;
but in the art , in studying failure , failure must be an alternative , because there &apos;s a trust of trust .
no important under@@ catch , the innovation meant , became the risk of risk .
you have to be prepared to take those risks .
this is the thought that i would like to give you to the way . failure is definitely an alternative , fear , but not . thank you .
today , i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and this may surprise you , because my day work on the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seed , the things that we have to invent and provide to allow the poorest two billion lives .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , especially more important than anyone on the planet .
climate change is that their sa@@ ddle are not growing over many years , and it &apos;s too much or too small , and things will change the way that their fragile environment cannot sustain .
that leads to hunger . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to accidents .
so , climate change will become terrible for you .
in addition , energy is very important for them .
the fact is , if you could reduce just one thing to the price , the poverty would go down to the most effective .
now , energy is about time .
in fact , the progress society is based on energy advances .
the ko@@ hl@@ er@@ evolution is driving the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a very rapid case of electricity , and so we have refriger@@ ators , climate change , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
so we are in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we cut the price -- let &apos;s get the price down -- we &apos;re in a new barrier , and that barrier depends on co2 .
co2 war@@ ys the planets , and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they &apos;re linking the carbon carbon , which leads to temperature increase , and that temperature increase has a few very negative consequences . effects on the weather and perhaps worse , the indire@@ ct consequence that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt and collapse all the way .
now , the ex@@ positions between a carbon increase , and the following temperature shift , and where it &apos;s going to be more , there &apos;s a few in@@ liers , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly no clarity of how bad these consequences are , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
i &apos;ve asked the top scientists several times , &quot; must we really get down to zero ?
does not make half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we get near zero , the temperature will continue .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different to say , we have a three-@@ foot tall truck , which has to set up under a three-@@ foot bridge , and you can put it underneath .
this has to go down to zero .
well , we cover a lot of carbon dioxide , over 26 billion tons every year .
every americans are about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
in average , it &apos;s about five tons of everybody on the planet .
and somehow we have to create changes that we can get down to zero .
it &apos;s gone up so far .
only different economic changes have influenced it at all , and we need to go from a distance to go down to zero and down to zero .
this equation has four factors . you have a bit more multipli@@ cation . you have this thing on the left -- co2 , which you want to bring towards zero , and that will depend on the number of people on average , the average energy for every person in average , the average energy for every service and the co2 .
so let &apos;s take a look at each other , and let &apos;s think about how we get to zero .
probably one of these numbers has to come close to zero .
now this is fundamental algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first , we have the population .
today , 6.@@ 8 billion people live .
and it relates to 9 billion . it &apos;s going to move to nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccine , health care and re@@ production medicine , we could reduce that by 10 percent up to 15 percent , but at the time we see an slope around 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
it &apos;s all about food , the food that we eat , clothing , television .
these are very good things and poverty reduction , which means to make these services available almost everybody on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to take off and use less , but on average , this number is going to rise every year , and so far more than double , the number of services that will be placed per person .
this is a very fundamental service . is there a light at home so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their school tasks under the street .
well , efficiency , the e , the energy per service , is finally good news .
we have something that goes up .
because of different successes in the light sector , through other au@@ ms , through new methods in building building , there are many services , some of their energy supplies are reduced by 90 percent .
in other services , like the manufacturing of fertili@@ ze , 10@@ 5 : 0@@ 5 : 5@@ 6,000 -- by tas@@ 5 : 0@@ 5 : 0@@ 5 : 5@@ hom@@ or air , or air transportation , is a lot of space for improvement .
in common , if we &apos;re optimistic , we may get a factor about a factor three or maybe even about six .
but in the first three factors , we &apos;re now from 26 billion perhaps the best 13 billion tons , and that &apos;s just not enough .
so , let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key factor -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that will be clear@@ ed a unit of energy .
it &apos;s the question if you can get that to zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every manufacturing method for electricity now is co2 , except renewable energy and nuclear energy .
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need energy wonders .
now , if i use the word &quot; miracle , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the micro@@ processor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
the internet and the service is a miracle .
the people here have contributed to many of these wonders .
there &apos;s no deadline usually that you need a miracle to a certain date .
and you usually say , you know , it &apos;s just wrong and some people don &apos;t .
but in this case , we have to get full gas and get a miracle in very short time .
now , i asked myself , how can i really get that ?
is there a natural illustration , a demonstration that the notion of the people here ?
i reminded me last year when i got mosquitos , and somehow people liked this .
the idea was really very clever for you , you know , there are people living with mosquit@@ oes .
for energy , this was me .
i decided that the release of fire@@ flies , i decided , would be here to the environment .
so here are a few natural fire@@ flies .
you would tell me they don &apos;t bite . in fact , they don &apos;t even leave the glass .
well , there &apos;s all kinds of playful solutions like this , but they don &apos;t bring a lot of them .
we need to have solutions , either one or a few who have an unimaginable amount of scale and unimaginable distress , and even though there are many directions where people are looking for , i really see only five who can afford these great demands .
i &apos;ve gone out of time , geo@@ ila , fusion and bio@@ fuel .
those may be a modern contribution , and if you do better than i expect , it would be great , but my real statement here is that we have to get to all of those five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they &apos;re in denial of significant problems .
let &apos;s first look at burning fossil fuels , from either coal or natural gas .
what you &apos;ve got to do is just seem to be simple , but it &apos;s not . you have to get rid of all the co2 that comes out of the burn out of the tail , reaching under pressure , and then hope , and hope it stays there .
there are a bunch of libraries projects that do this on a 60 percent -- 80 percent , but it &apos;s going to get 100 percent to get it very difficult , and to make a trend for the smoking of co2 , it &apos;s a big challenge .
who will make it safer ?
who can guarantee something that literally has many billion times larger than any kind of waste that you can imagine from nuclear and other things ?
it &apos;s a lot of volume .
so this is a tough one .
next , nuclear energy .
it also has three big problems . the cost , especially in highly regulated countries , the question is , for safety , that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human work that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and what do you do with the trash ?
because it &apos;s not very large , it &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be sol@@ vable , and you should work on that .
i summar@@ ized the last three of them .
it &apos;s renewable energy as they are often called .
and they also -- even though it &apos;s great that they need no fuel -- they have a few por@@ tions .
one is the energy that these technologies are generating dramatically lower than the power of power .
that &apos;s energy , you &apos;re talking about many square miles , a thousand times more than an ordinary power power .
and also , these sources are sub@@ imposed .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem the whole day , it doesn &apos;t seem to be all the day , and the wind doesn &apos;t even fly .
and so , if you have to depend on these sources , you have to have a way that energy is in times when you &apos;re not available .
so there &apos;s a big cost of economic challenges . there are challenges in terms of transmission , and , for example , the energy source of the country is , you don &apos;t just need the technology , you have to deal with the risk of where it comes from .
and there &apos;s the camp@@ problem .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve got all kinds of batteries that are made , looking for cars , computers , mobile phones , mobile lam@@ ps , for everything . and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been using with the amount of electronic energy , which is using the world , which is using the world , less than 10 minutes of total energy .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that &apos;s going to be a factor 100 better than the circumstances of time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
this is what happens when you try to make these sub@@ bro@@ als sources about saying 20 percent -- 30 percent of the consumption .
if you want to join 100 percent , you need an incredible beautiful battery .
now , where are we going to go , what &apos;s the right approach ?
a manhattan project ? how do we get to the target ?
what we need are many companies working on this . hundreds of them .
in each one of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
you &apos;ll say , they &apos;re mad ! that &apos;s fine .
i think there &apos;s a lot in the ted group that &apos;s already involved there .
bill big has multiple companies , including one named es@@ ol@@ ar has the great solar technology .
vin@@ elle k@@ ho@@ ll@@ a invested in dozens of companies making great things and interesting possibilities , and i &apos;m trying to support that .
nathan myhrvold , and i fund a company , who , perhaps surprisingly , is missing the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the nuclear sphere , modular , liquid .
the development has stopped in this industry a few times , so it &apos;s not a great surprise that some good concepts are around .
the ter@@ ra@@ cable concept means that instead of a part of the uranium , one percent , the u@@ 2@@ 35 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the u@@ 2@@ 38 .
this is a pretty insane idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about this for a long time , but you could never know whether it was going to work , but since there &apos;s modern supercomputer , you can simulate it , and you can see that , yes , with the right materials , it looks like it &apos;s working .
and because you burn that 99 percent , the cost of cost is much better .
in fact , you burn the trash , and you can even use the waste of the greenhouse reactors as a mess .
instead of breaking your head , you just burn it . a great thing .
the ur@@ an is funded by education , a bit like a candle .
you can see it &apos;s a key pill@@ ar , often known as the traveling wave reactor .
that really solves the fuel problem .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
that &apos;s the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s burned up today , which means it &apos;s fine .
the motors for hundreds of years .
and if you add ocean water and you just cut it , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges there , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to move forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
what should our testimony look like ?
well , let &apos;s go to the target we have to reach , and then we talk about the beginning .
many of them speak from an 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of the 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still agriculture , and hopefully , whale drone and cement will be clean .
so , to reach these 80 percent , the industrial states , including countries like china , are completely turning their electricity generation .
the other note is whether we use the zero emissions technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we are on the way to get them to the rest .
it &apos;s great .
this becomes a key element of this sphere .
if we go back from there , what should the 2020 look like ?
it should contain these two elements again .
we should use the effects of gravity to get reduction on the way , and the less we are sw@@ ing , the lower the co2 will be , and it &apos;s also the temperature .
but actually , this note for the things that we &apos;re doing , which is not completely the big redu@@ ctions , just the same , or even a bit less important than the other , which is the speed of innovation for this gap .
and we &apos;ve got to track this through gas , and we can measure that , in corporate numbers , in libraries projects and regulation .
there &apos;s lots of great books on this issue .
the al gore book said , &quot; we have choice , &quot; and david mck@@ a@@ ys &quot; perpet@@ energy triumph of the hot air . &quot;
they &apos;re really going to go through it and create a framework where this can be widely discussed , because we need to support all sides .
there &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
this is a wish .
a very clever wish that we invent this technology .
if you just put a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that wish , or i could choose that wish , which is , halfway energy energy without co2 .
this has the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the world &apos;s going to be terrible at the length of long and short-term people , between the u.s. and china , between poor and rich growth , and almost all the lives of these two billion will be much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
what do i do ?
we need to use for more research .
if countries meet in places like head@@ , they should not just talk about co2 .
you should discuss this innovation strategy , and you would be shocked by the ridicul@@ es that are being used for these innovative approaches .
we need market incentives , carbon taxes , block@@ &amp; amp ; trade is something that makes a price signal .
we have to spread the message .
we need to have dialogue more rational and more complete and the things that are being done by the government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to get ter@@ ra@@ capacity to understand something better -- first , can you give us an idea of scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to get the simulation on a supercomputer , to get all the great scientists , we just need a few 10 million , and even if we &apos;ve tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it &apos;s safe , you &apos;re only in the 100 million .
the difficult step is building the first reactor , to find more billions of billions , the regul@@ arity and the place that actually build the first of them .
when the first one is done , as i promised it , it &apos;s all very clear , because the economy , the energy energy , is as different as we know it .
in order to understand that , that means to build deep in the ground , almost like a vertical pill@@ ar fuel , that needed ur@@ ans , and then , you know , the process is going to move forward ?
b@@ g : exactly . now , you &apos;ve got to re@@ fill the reactor , so there &apos;s a lot of people and lots of controls that can go wrong . this thing , where you open it and put things in -- it &apos;s not good .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can put it for 60 years -- think about a pill@@ ar -- they bury , without the whole complexity .
and it &apos;s sitting there for 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
a nuclear reactor , which provides itself a solution to the garbage .
b@@ g : yeah . now , what happens to the garbage is that you can sit down -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- then you take it and put it in the next reactor .
and we &apos;re starting by taking the garbage , which exists already in this heat basin , or dry feeding in the reactors . that &apos;s our initial fuel .
so , what &apos;s a problem for these reactors is what we &apos;re doing in our reefs , and that &apos;s dramatically reduced to the waste of waste during this process .
but as you talk to various people in the world about these possibilities .
where is the most interested in making it happen ?
b@@ g : now , we haven &apos;t put ourselves on a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting dis@@ legal rules for everything called the &quot; nucleus &quot; in the name , and there &apos;s a lot of interest and the people of the company in russia , india , china -- i was here , and i &apos;ve been talking about the energy agenda .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have done something in the direction .
this is a kind of a thing that was made .
this is a very important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor , and some countries have built this , so everyone who has done a fast reactor is a candidate for our first .
in your idea , time and probability , would you really look like this ?
b@@ g : now , we need one of these scaling , generating things that are very cheap , we &apos;ve got 20 years to invent and then 20 years .
this is kind of the deadline that the environmental models that we have to think about .
and , you know , ter@@ ra@@ power , if everything goes well , and it &apos;s a great wish , it could be easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of companies , and we need hundreds of them that work in the way that they work for their pilots to do for that .
and it would be the best if it &apos;s possible , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
so , what &apos;s the big possible breakthroughs , that &apos;s the biggest thing you know ?
b@@ g : a energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
it would also have been the environmental imperative , but it makes it much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know whose work as well as this , but there &apos;s the modular technique , which is a different approach .
there &apos;s an liquid reactor guy that seems to be difficult , but maybe they say that about us .
and so , there &apos;s different , but the nice thing about it is that a ur@@ an molecule has a million times a lot of energy , say , a coal molecule , and so , if you can deal with the problems , and that &apos;s mostly the radiation , the footprint , and the cost , is the potential , and the effect of the country , and the other things , is almost in your own .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we need to use threats to try and maintain the earth temperature ?
b@@ g : if you get into this situation , it &apos;s as if you &apos;ve eaten too much , and it &apos;s a heart attack . what do you do ? you might need a heart surgery or something .
there &apos;s a research curve called geo@@ engineering , which is what &apos;s called a different techniques to delay the warming , so that we would spend 20 or 30 years longer around us .
this is just an insurance technique .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
you know , some people say , you shouldn &apos;t be working on insurance , because it might make it bad , so you keep eating , because you know that you &apos;re going to save heart surgery .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you think about the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a dis@@ course in geo@@ engineering about whether you should have that , if things get faster , or that innovation needs longer than we expect .
climate change : have you got one or two sentences for them to convince you ?
b@@ g : well , unfortunately , the skep@@ tics live in very different camps .
those who make scientific argument are very little .
do you think there are negative effects to do with the clouds that move things ?
there are very , very few things that you can actually tell , which is an opportunity in a million .
the main problem here is similar to aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay it a lot later .
and so , the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of pressing problems to invest into something that you just have later -- and that is that the investment isn &apos;t so clear . and , in fact , the investment is not necessarily the worst scenario , and there &apos;s people in the rich world looking at ipcc and saying , okay , that &apos;s not a big drama .
the fact is that this uncertainty should be concerned to us .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and the co2 goes away at the same time , the skep@@ tics also say , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not saying that it doesn &apos;t take co2 , i wish it &apos;s because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be the answer to the b@@ j@@ thouse l@@ om@@ bor@@ g argument , that if you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals in the country suffering , the poverty is falling , the reduction of malaria , and so on that there are better things we can do .
b@@ g : well , the actual spending for research -- let &apos;s say u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than they do today -- it &apos;s not that dramatic .
other things should not suffer .
you can get too big money , and you can disagree with reasonable people , if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and it &apos;s trying to fund that . for me , most of the waste is happening here .
it &apos;s because , you know , it &apos;s very short about a cost of learning , and it &apos;s just the learning curve , and i think we should try to be more things that have the potential to be much cheaper .
if the slope you get is a very high energy attack , you can only keep up the rich .
i mean , every one of us here could spend five times as much for our energy to change their lifestyle .
for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even l@@ om@@ bor@@ g thinks .
his new ma@@ w is now , &quot; why won &apos;t research be spoken ? &quot;
it &apos;s still being associated because of his former stories , associated with the skep@@ ticism camp , but he understood that this is a very elaborate group , and therefore he &apos;s going to get the research argument .
and this is a kind of thought that i think is appropriate .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , how small it is .
bill , i think , for almost all people here when i say , i really hope that your wish will be true . many , thank you .
b@@ g : thank you .
a few years ago , at ted , peter sk@@ ill@@ man is a design competition called &quot; the marshmallow challenge . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . four teams have to be the biggest possible array structure with 20 spaghetti , about 1@@ m tape and building a marshmallow .
the marshmallow must be on top of it .
and , even though it &apos;s really easy , it &apos;s really hard , because people are getting it very fast .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i &apos;ve turned it into design kerry .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 and 70 workshops around the world , with students , developers and architects , even by c@@ tos and architects , and it &apos;s something that allows deep impres@@ sions to the nature of collaboration and i want to share some of them .
and usually most people start to think about the task .
you talk about it , you think about what it &apos;s going to look like .
then they invest a little time in planning and organization , and they put out spaghetti .
they invest a lot of their time in the building of the structures .
and finally , before you don &apos;t have a time , somebody takes the marshmallow , and you put it on the top , and you put it back , you go back and , you know , &quot; ta@@ -@@ da . &quot;
but what happens , almost always , is that the &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; becomes &quot; uh-@@ oh , &quot; because the weight of the marshmallow makes that the whole thing will strike and fall down .
there &apos;s a series of people who have much more &quot; uh-@@ oh &quot; moments than others , and among the worst are new b@@ w@@ b graduates .
they lie to cheat , they &apos;re confused , they &apos;re really confused .
and of course , there are teams that have much more &quot; ta@@ -@@ da equipment , &quot; and among the best are new sons of the car .
and it &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter told us , they don &apos;t just produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be wondering is , how does this happen ? why ? what about those ?
and peter tells you , &quot; none of the kids spend time at the heart of spaghetti g@@ m@@ b@@ h . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest time in power combat .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that b@@ w@@ le students were trained to find a right plan , ok !
and then to realize .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
and what children &apos;s personal kids do is they start building the marshmallow and building prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow , so that they have an opportunity to repair the way they have .
constru@@ tion@@ ans recognize this kind of collaboration as the essence of a geometric antidote .
and with each attempt , kids immediately get feedback and what &apos;s not .
so , the capacity to work with prototypes is essential -- but let &apos;s see how different teams act .
the average for most of them is at the most part , b@@ w@@ le students create half of them , lawyers do something more , but not much , children &apos;s gardens are better than adults .
who &apos;s most successful ?
architects and engineers , for happiness .
thir@@ m is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they understand triangles and self-@@ ampli@@ ent geometric patterns are the key to build structures .
ceos are on average . but here it gets interesting .
you get an ex@@ le@@ tive admini@@ strator on the team , you &apos;ll be significantly better .
it &apos;s incredible . you see around , and you see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict . why is this ?
because they have special skills of the process .
they trigger the process , they understand it .
and this team , the bot@@ t and the work , is the performance of the team .
specialized skills and process skills and its combination leads to success .
if you have 10 teams doing the typical , you get about six , you have a stable structure .
i tried something interesting now .
i thought we &apos;ll bring the po@@ yer right now .
so i offered a $ 10,000 price of software for the winner .
what do you think happened to these design students ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anybody had built an eight-@@ inch building , he would have carried the price home .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high competition have a strong effect ?
we repeated this exercise with the same students .
what do you think happened now ?
now , they understood the advantage of the prototype .
it was from the same , bad team one below the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
so there &apos;s very deep lessons for us , the nature of drive and success .
you might ask , why would anyone actually spend a marshmallow challenging ?
the reason is , i &apos;m helping digital tools and processes to help teams , cars , video games and visually bust .
and what the marshmallow &apos;s challenge is , it helps to identify them .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge requires a common experience , a common language or property , to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested , you can visit marshmallow challen@@ ge@@ ge@@ .com .
it &apos;s a blog where you &apos;re building the marshmallow .
there &apos;s a pac@@ -@@ by-@@ step line there .
you find crazy examples from all the world , how people can optimize and refin@@ alize the system .
there &apos;s also a population .
and the base lesson , i think , is actually a commitment sport .
it requires that we all put our senses on the task , and we think we use our thinking , how our emotions and our doing , in the challenge that we are facing .
and sometimes there &apos;s a little prototype of this experience of what it needs to bring us from a &quot; uh-@@ oh &quot; to a &quot; uh-@@ -@@ da moment . &quot;
and that can make a difference .
thank you .
so , let &apos;s have a machine .
a big machine , a cool , ted machine , and this is a time machine .
and everybody in this room needs to be in .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
and i wonder what they would choose , because i &apos;ve often asked my friends in the last time , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there was cars or twitter or america .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that you &apos;re kind of a nostal@@ gie to think about .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a genius .
it &apos;s because possibilities don &apos;t go back on the planet , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the biggest time that we &apos;ve ever got on this planet , no matter what scale you have : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , declining diseases .
there was never a time like this .
my great-@@ grandparents died all when they were 60 .
my grandparents raised this number to 70 .
my parents are 80 to the heel .
so there should be better at the beginning of my death row .
but it &apos;s not about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than this .
a kid who is born today in new delhi might expect to live as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is this ?
smallpox . smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
they have shaped the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we hired them . boom .
in the rich world there are diseases that have millions of us even more likely to have a generation yet .
di@@ ph@@ ong , mol@@ ts , child paralysis ...
does anyone even know what this is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are successes of the scientific method .
and from my point of view , the scientific method is to try and see if it works , it changes if it doesn &apos;t do it , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , this is all the good news , because there &apos;s a few other problems , and they were often mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people in this world are hungry every day .
this number rises , and it goes very fast , and it &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we used our imagination to destroy this world as well .
water , ur@@ arable land , rainforests , oil , gas , gas : they disappear , and , if we don &apos;t get out of this chaos , we &apos;re not going to go from this chaos .
so the question is , can we do this ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the country they live in .
i think we can supply this world with energy that doesn &apos;t destroy it simultaneously .
i think it &apos;s really , and no , that &apos;s not a trick .
but this is what i &apos;m holding on at night -- one of the things that hold me on at night -- we &apos;ve never used scientific progress as well .
and we &apos;ve also never been able to put it in sensible , as we can today .
we &apos;re on the threshold too amazing , amazing events in many places , and i really think that we would have to go back hundreds of thousands of years before the enlightenment to find a time where we &apos;ve been fighting progress in which we &apos;ve been able to struggle with these things in more front of these things .
people are pil@@ ing in their faith , so so deeply that you can &apos;t get rid of it .
not even the truth will get rid of it .
and you hear , everybody has a right one in his opinion ; it &apos;s a very good way of progress .
but you know what you don &apos;t have ?
they don &apos;t have their own facts . &apos; &apos; training , they don &apos;t .
and i used a while to figure this out .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccin@@ ation for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
and i was amazed to turn to resistance , which is resistance to what is the most effective activity in the history of humanity .
i didn &apos;t know what i was supposed to do , so i just did what i do , i wrote an article and continued .
and soon , i wrote an article on genetic food .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i also wrote a paper about it , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; fran@@ ken@@ food , &quot; why they thought molecules were going to be in a certain way rather than a random way of the nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept going .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we &apos;re rich , we eat , that &apos;s okay .
but i was worried about this article , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i found it .
and that &apos;s because these fana@@ cs that were crazy at all was not even fana@@ tic .
these were self-@@ minded people , educated people , related people .
they were just like people in this room .
and that was a mess .
but then i thought , you know what , be honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship with progress before .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we &apos;re talking about ironic , with small input signs , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , so there &apos;s reason , and i think we know what &apos;s the reason .
we have trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science lost itself , and there &apos;s no reason why it should not be .
you can just call a few names , and people will understand .
cher@@ nobyl , b@@ o@@ al , the challen@@ ger , vi@@ ox@@ x , mass destruction , the u.s. presidential election .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people we thought they were always right . be skeptical .
ask , demand the evidence , demand evidence .
don &apos;t take anything for granted .
but now it &apos;s going to be , if you have a evidence , you have to think of this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
and i can say that we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen you , and hopefully never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story , which is the autism epidemic with the mas@@ aches , mu@@ shrimp , and roman vaccine .
very frightening .
exploration studies were done to see if that was true .
it should be done studies ; it &apos;s serious .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all alike , no correlation , no connection , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because we believe in anecdot@@ es , we think what we see is what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t believe in a prototyping documents of a government that gives us data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of this was catastrophic .
catastrophic because of this fact , the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccin@@ ators go down .
this is scand@@ al@@ ous , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s horrible .
what &apos;s happened is we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
because did somebody here ?
does anyone in the audience have one in the audience die ?
not very often happens .
don &apos;t happen in this country at all , but 16@@ 0,000 times in the world last year .
this is a lot of deaths by mas@@ pers , 20 per hour .
but because this is not happening here , we can put it in , and people like jenny mc@@ car@@ thy can walk around and get news from fear and illiterate platforms like oprah and larry king live .
and they can do that because they &apos;re not connecting cause and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never the same .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and it &apos;s very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas sal@@ k .
he liber@@ ated us from one of the worst things of mankind .
no fear , no source , child paralysis , boom , disappeared .
the guy in the middle not so much .
it &apos;s called paul off@@ it .
he &apos;s just developed a few other people with a pink virus vaccine .
it can save the lives of 4@@ 00@@ -- 500,000 kids a year in the developing world .
pretty good , right ?
well , this is good , except that paul &apos;s walking around , talking about vaccines , and saying , how valuable they are , and that people just should stop car@@ bers .
and that &apos;s actually what he says .
so paul is a terrorist .
when paul talks in a public stop , he can &apos;t tell no guns .
he gets calls at home , because people like to tell him that they know where his kids go to school .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say , but vaccines are essential .
take it on , the diseases return , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening .
we now have mas@@ ms in this country .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon kids will die again , because this is just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die .
what about parenting ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
a bunch of audio in me wrote a few weeks ago , and i think i &apos;m a little bit of step .
no one has ever said this before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccin@@ ate her kid against child mortality . no .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have a child paralysis , and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have a child paralysis in this country yesterday .
now , i don &apos;t know , i don &apos;t know , maybe there &apos;s somebody in lagos in lagos , and just flies to los angeles , right now , about ohio .
and in a few hours , he &apos;s offering a car , and he &apos;s going to go to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these fantastic fantastic ted dinner tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a paraly@@ tating disease , and we don &apos;t know , because this is how the world works now .
this is the planet we live on . don &apos;t pretend it &apos;s not .
we love to get us on lying . we love that .
did you all take your vitam@@ ine in this morning ?
e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , a small anti-@@ oxi@@ oxi@@ lation , that helps you on the jumps .
i know they did that because half of the americans do that every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it makes no difference , how often we find out that they &apos;re useless .
the data is constantly pointing .
it evapor@@ ates their ur@@ ine . it &apos;s almost never .
that &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark ur@@ ine .
i agree with them .
dark ur@@ ine . dark .
why do we do this ? why do we do this ?
well , i think , i understand -- we hate the pharmaceutical industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we should not . our healthcare system is mies .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely cold , and it &apos;s perfectly cold for ourselves to afford .
so we &apos;re walking away , and where do we walk ?
we walk into the arms of the placebo sphere .
this is great . i love the placebo destruction .
but you know , it &apos;s really serious , because the stuff is crap , and we spend billions of dollars .
and i have all kinds of little ps here .
k@@ one of them -- ging@@ ko , mo@@ ko , e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , mo@@ ai , ac@@ ai , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we spend billions of dollars .
and you know what ? if i say that , people shout me and say , &quot; what do you care ? let &apos;s do what you want . &quot;
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the health minister , which says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to adopt the evidence of my experts to mammography , &quot; or any cancer of cancer , who wants to treat his patient with ka@@ ff@@ e-@@ replacement .
if you go to this path , where belief and magic points replace science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to th@@ ab@@ o m@@ be@@ ki in south africa .
he brought to the 400,000 of his people , because he was on the fact that red bee@@ ases , bone and lemon oil , are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know that you can get the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of un@@ informed deaths in a country that gets worse than any other one of these disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have them . they always have them .
now , the brain &apos;s brain epidemic , in which we &apos;re right now , is this absur@@ de struggle between the fear of genetically changing foods and bio-@@ elite .
this is an i@@ dio@@ tic debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , metaphor .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every pile of rice , every branch of par@@ m , each branch , has been changed by people .
you know , there was no woman in paradise .
there was no can@@ v@@ ou@@ ds .
there was no christmas trees . we did all this .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 1@@ 1,000 years .
and some of them didn &apos;t work .
we have gotten rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
now we can make it more specific , and , of course , there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people , millions of people .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we &apos;re more sensitive to food .
why do we do this ?
now , what i &apos;m hearing is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , mono@@ culture , we don &apos;t want to have an enormous fields with one thing , which is wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent .
we don &apos;t want companies to own .
and you know what my answer to this is ?
yes , they &apos;re right . we fix this .
it &apos;s true , we have an enormous food problem , but that &apos;s not science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s pretty , morality , patent stuff .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we fear is truly dead , and it holds millions of people from the obstacle .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than at the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . shame .
you need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? genetically changed food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this raw stuff , like for example .
mani@@ ok is something that half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s about a potato .
it &apos;s just a seed calories . it &apos;s mies .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients , it has no protein , and scientists build all this in it .
and then people could eat the food , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
you wouldn &apos;t cook , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be a che@@ z pan , but it would be nice .
and everything i can say is , why do we struggle ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask , why do we struggle ?
because we don &apos;t want to push genes around ?
it &apos;s not about throwing gene around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our very ridiculous passion for hormones , our bu@@ ck on bigger food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice crisis cake , it &apos;s about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s going to be time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we do so on , we &apos;re going to be guilty about something that we do , i think is not guilty , high-tech coloni@@ alism .
there &apos;s no aspect of what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s self-@@ addicted , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy of ours , and we have to really stop this .
so , after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; would you still want to go into this ridiculous time machine and go into the future ? &quot;
anyway . i mean , i mean .
right now , they &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this time machine in everything we want .
we can move them where we want to move them , and we &apos;ll move them where we want .
we have to take these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go to the time machine , we &apos;re going to be happy to have that .
i know we can , and as far as it &apos;s in me , it &apos;s something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for a while , i &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect , and it might seem strange that a magician is interested in it , unless you look at it as i am , as &quot; a deception that becomes something like that , if you just believe in it . &quot;
in other words , sugar pills , in some studies , showed a measurable effect , the placebo persi@@ ders , and that &apos;s because the person thinks what &apos;s going on with her , is a pharmaceutical or a kind of ... in the pain , for example , is , if the patient is only solid enough in the body that you call the placebo effect .
a deception becomes something like this , because somebody &apos;s going to take it .
so we &apos;re also trying to understand each other , i &apos;m going to show you a very fundamental , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how he works . this is a trick that at least since the 1950s is in every magic book for children .
i myself learned it from the cu@@ b sc@@ out magic of the paths in the 1970s .
i &apos;ll take it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i &apos;m explaining him .
so , you see what happens .
the knife you can study , my hand , that you can study .
i &apos;m going to just hold the knife in my own way .
i go back my sle@@ ev@@ ess .
and to make sure that nothing goes away in my sle@@ ev@@ ess or from it , i &apos;m just going to push my wrist right here .
in this way , you can see that no time is going to move anything . as long as i play here , nothing can go in my sle@@ ev@@ ess or not .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife will be held by my naked physical magnetism .
it &apos;s actually so solid in his place that i can shake it , without the knife falling down .
there &apos;s nothing going on in my sle@@ ev@@ ess , or it comes out , and you can study it .
ta@@ -@@ da .
now , this is a trick that i often give a little bit of kids who care about magic , because you can learn a lot about deception , if you look closely , though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
probably many of you in the room are familiar with this trick .
it works like this .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i &apos;m saying that i close my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sle@@ eve disappears , and it &apos;s a lie .
the reason i encourage my wrist is that it &apos;s the real secret of illusion .
because , in the moment , where i turn my hand away from you , so you see them from the back , this finger is moving , my time , just from where he was , in a position where he was so upset .
great trick ?
in the back there , somebody who has no childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and if i turn around , the finger changes its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , which is why you don &apos;t realize that here &apos;s just three fingers down here , because the mind and the way that it functions information doesn &apos;t count one , one , two , three , but you see as a group .
but that &apos;s not what you &apos;re doing here , and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s going to hit it , but not by the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my time , which is now there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing is going to happen by turning me back through this movement , that the finger is moving back .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this is a trick , you can take your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what did this have to do with the placebo ?
so , one year ago , i read a study that really blew me .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and that was , for me , an amazing thing .
because it turns out that , if you offer a placebo in the form of a white pill , in the form of an eternal canal , it &apos;s just a round , white pill , which has a particular measurement effect .
but if you look at the shape where you &apos;re going to change the placebo , for example , in a smaller pill , and you can paint that blue and paint a letter , it &apos;s really measurable .
and that , although not any pharmaceutical -- it &apos;s just sugar pills .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? i really kept it out .
but it turns out it &apos;s not everything .
if you take it , it &apos;s more effective than any shape .
a colored capsule , which is at an end yellow and the other red , is better than a white capsule .
the do@@ tization also plays a role .
a pill twice is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics , i &apos;m sorry .
but the key thing is ...
... also , the dodo figures play a role .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to get to the needle .
right ? a sy@@ ringe with a force -- a few milli@@ li@@ ters of a more effective substance that you inject a patient .
it creates a very strong picture in your head . it &apos;s much stronger than a white pill .
this graph is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time , if we have a proje@@ ctor .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
and none of them has a really pharmaceutical trait . it &apos;s just our faith that made us more powerful .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i &apos;ll take something that &apos;s obviously a deception , and let it look real .
we know from the study that you have to reach to the needle when to go to it .
this is an eight-@@ inch needle . it &apos;s very , very high , and i &apos;m going to give you a little sterile .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not dam@@ ian special meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
now , i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin , and i &apos;m going through them through them , until again , on the other side .
if you get nasty -- if you fall easily in o@@ in@@ s -- i &apos;ve done this a few friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and it &apos;s become almost more powerful .
so , i &apos;m pro@@ posing , if you &apos;re going to get sick , then you look for the next 30 seconds , or , you know , what , i &apos;m going to do the first part of the back here .
you can see it in the same way , but you can see if you want .
so , it goes , right here , where my flesh starts , the lower part of my arm , i &apos;m just going to get a little cut .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you make that crazy ?
and now just a little bit through my skin and on the other side of it .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we have in the texture .
about it .
but now , you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
yeah .
i know what people think when you see this .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so stupid , and you can get through yourself , just to speak for a few minutes . &quot;
now , i &apos;m going to show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yes , i know .
and people say , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t see that right . &quot;
people in the side rooms are now coming in .
so let me show you the close place .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
this is my flesh , and i can spin this .
i &apos;m sorry . if you get nice , look away , don &apos;t look .
the people who are at the back of the day at some point will say , &quot; well , yeah , it looks pretty impressive , but if it was real , you see , you know , here is a hole , and it would be , you know , it would be a hole . &quot;
okay , let me paste a little blood for you .
yes , here it is .
i would usually take the needle out .
i would produce my arm and show them that there are no injuries .
but i think in this frame here , and the purpose of doing something real , i &apos;m just going to leave the needle in there and go from the stage .
we &apos;ll see a couple of times in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;ll enjoy it . thank you very much .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
i have a number of people counting the number of books that worked with happiness in the title in the last five years , and they gave up to about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there &apos;s a massive wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of happiness .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all this tide of work , there are several cognitive ones that are kind of impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mostly going to act from this cognitive drop .
this is true of la@@ ia , thinking about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true of scientists thinking about happiness , because it turns out that we &apos;re just as mess as everybody else is .
the first one of these fall is to admit complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness simply isn &apos;t useful , because we apply it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could put it on , but in large and large , it &apos;s something that we need to give up , and we &apos;re going to have to think about the complicated point of what well-being is .
the second trap is a transformation of experience and memory : basically , it &apos;s going to be between happy in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both mixed together in the idea of happiness .
and the third is that concentrations is rational , and that &apos;s the im@@ happy fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact that affects well-being without being informed .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i would like to start with someone who had a policy answer meeting after one of my lectures , who announced a story .
and then he added , really , really emotionally , that &apos;s got the experience .
but that didn &apos;t .
what ruined was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes of lovely music .
they didn &apos;t eat because he was love with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he had to keep .
what this really tells us is that we can think about ourselves and about other people in the sense of two kinds of self .
there &apos;s a living self that lives in the present and the present is able to experience the past , but basically just the present .
it &apos;s the living self that the doctor is doing -- you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; does it hurt now when i &apos;m here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s an opinion of self , and the recall self is that it &apos;s going to take place and keep the history of life in life , and it &apos;s to say , &quot; how did you feel in the last time ? &quot;
or , &quot; what was your journey to alb@@ ania ? &quot;
these are two very different units that live itself and the recall self , and the two , and the two , is part of the relationship of happiness .
now , the memory self is a storyteller .
and it really starts with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories about telling stories .
our memory tells us stories that means what we can keep from our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients going on a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go to the details . it &apos;s not painful today , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds of their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who would have suffered more ? &quot;
and this is a very simple question .
patient b has suffered more . his confusion was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had a patient , and more .
but now , there &apos;s another question , &quot; how do these patients think they suffered ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patients a much worse remind had a much worse remind of the print as a patient b.
the stories of the gut were different , and a very crucial part of the story is how it ends .
and none of these stories are very intricate or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
and the worse that is worse , where the pain was at the end of it , it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know ?
because we asked these people to be asked by their gut , and a lot later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing overall ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a b for b .
well , this is a direct conflict between the living self and the recall self .
in terms of growing self , b was clearly a bad time .
well , what you could do with a patient , and we &apos;ve actually done clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s done , you could actually avoid the sheer reflection of the patient by just putting the tube in without very much .
that will lead to the patient , but it &apos;s a little bit less than it did before .
and if you do this for a few minutes , you make that the living self is worse from a patient &apos;s self , and you have to make sure that the mind itself is much better from the patient a much better , because now you &apos;ve given a better story about his experience .
so what is a story ?
and that &apos;s true of the stories that will give us memory and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we invent .
and what a story is , it turns out , is turn@@ ing , significant eye and end .
end , it &apos;s very , very important , and in this case , protected to the end .
well , living itself lives continuously .
it has eyes of life , one after the other .
and you ask , what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really easy . they &apos;re always lost forever .
i mean , most of the eyes of our lives -- and i &apos;ve figured that out -- you know , the psychological present is about three seconds long than about three seconds , which means , you know , there &apos;s about 600 million of them in a month . most of them don &apos;t leave .
most of them are completely ignored by the recall self .
and yet , you can kind of get the impression that you should count that what &apos;s happening during this view of life is our lives .
it &apos;s the finite resource that we consume as we are in this world .
and how we consume it would seem to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that holds the memory for us .
so we &apos;ve got the recall self and the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is with time .
in perspective of the growing self , if you have a holiday , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two-@@ week vacation is twice as good as the week week .
this is how it doesn &apos;t work at all .
for the recall self , a two-@@ week vacation is barely better than the week , because there &apos;s no new memories .
they have not changed the story .
and in this way , the critical variable is actually the critical variable that &apos;s very different from itself from a living self . time has very little impact on this story .
well , the recall self is making more than remember and stories .
it &apos;s actually the kind of thing that makes decisions , because if you have a patient , you say , you know , we &apos;ve got two strokes on two different surgeons , and we decide that , you know , the choice that memory is less bad , which is less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be selected .
the living self has no voice in this choice .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose between experience . we choose between memories of experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as experiences .
we think about our future as a prediction .
and basically you can look at that , you know , as a tyran@@ ni@@ i of the recall self , and you can think of it as one , and you can think of it as a one , which is a living self from experiences that doesn &apos;t need the living self .
i have the impression that if we do a holiday , it &apos;s very often the case , which means we &apos;re doing a holiday in the service of the mind itself .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much are we from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that will be given for the dominance self .
and if i think about it , i think about a holiday that we &apos;ve done a few years ago in antarctica , which is clearly the best holiday i had ever had , and i think relatively often about the relationship , how often i think of other vacation .
and i probably have my memories on this three-year-old journey , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i &apos;ve ever opened the folder with the 600 pictures in it , i spent one more .
now , these are three weeks , and this is just a five-@@ hour one .
there seems to be an in@@ agreement .
now , i may be a little extreme , you know , how little valve i have on the fuel of memories , but even if you do more of it , you have a real question . why do we give memories so much weight to the weight that we experience ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next holiday , you know , at the end of the vacation , all your images get wiped out , and you get an am@@ ne@@ stical drug so you will remember nothing .
now , would you choose the same holiday ?
and if you choose a different holiday , there &apos;s a conflict between your two species of self , and you have to think about how you choose this conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think about time , you get an answer . and if you think about memories , you could get a different answer .
why we choose the vacation that we choose is a problem , which is a choice between the two species of self .
well , the two types of self , two respects of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one self .
so you can ask , how happy is the living self ?
and then you would ask , how happy are the eyes in life itself ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re able to get a pretty good idea from happiness itself over time .
if you ask the happiness of the conscious self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
that &apos;s not how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or delighted is , if this person thinks about their lives .
very different term .
everybody who doesn &apos;t different these terms will be the study of happiness , and i &apos;m part of a lot of researchers about well-being , which is the study of happiness for the long time .
the distinction between the happiness of the living self and the satisfaction of the mind itself is recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two separate .
the gallup organization has a worldwide survey where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and about their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started learning about the happiness of the self .
and the main lesson that we see , i think , is learned that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how someone &apos;s happy with his life , and it doesn &apos;t really teach you a lot about how happy he lives and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the correlation of the correlation , the correlation is about .@@ 5 .
what that means is that if you meet somebody , and you would tell them , oh , his father is a two-@@ meter man , how much would you know about the size ?
well , you would know something about his height , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
when i tell you that somebody has been in charge of a 10 in a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his living self .
so the correlation is small .
we know something about what the happiness of happiness determines .
we know money is very important , goals are very important .
we know happiness is mostly being satisfied with people that we like to spend time with people we like .
there &apos;s other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the self , you &apos;re going to do very different things at the end .
the implication of what i &apos;ve been saying here is that we should really not think of happiness as a treatment for well-being .
it &apos;s completely different .
well , very shortly , a different reason that we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same things when we think about life and when we actually live .
so if you ask the easy question , how happy people in california are not going to get the correct answer .
if you think about this question , you think people have to be happier in california when they say , in ohio .
and what &apos;s happened is , if you think about the life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , say , climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the living self , and it &apos;s not even important for the idea of thinking , which decides how happy people are .
now , because the memorable self is responsible , you can end up at the end -- some people could go to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track , what happens to people who are going to california to get happier .
well , your self will not be happier .
we know this .
but one thing will happen . you think you &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , you &apos;re going to remember how horrible weather was in ohio , and you feel that you &apos;ve made the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope that i gave you a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , when we were a couple of weeks ago , they told me that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came out of this place .
is this something that you can do , because you have a few minutes left now ?
daniel ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man : sure .
i think the most interesting conclusion that we &apos;ve found in the gallup survey is a number we didn &apos;t expect to find .
we found this in terms of the happiness of living itself .
when we looked at how feelings relate to income .
and it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 60@@ 0,000 , about 60@@ 0,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under an income of 60@@ 0,000 dollars a year .
60,000 .
d@@ k : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they &apos;re increasingly un@@ happier , the poorer they will .
we get this absolutely flat line .
i mean , i rarely saw so flat lines .
what happens is obviously that money doesn &apos;t make a experience of happiness , but that lack of money is safe for money , and we can measure this misery very , very clearly .
in the sense of the other self , the recall self , you get a different story .
the more money you deserve , the more you are .
it &apos;s not true of emotions .
but danny , in the entire american pursuit , is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people take this finding seriously , i mean , it seems to put everything on your head , everything we think , for example , in terms of tax politics and so on .
is there a chance that politicians think that the country is generally going to take a fund as seriously as it would be based on politics ?
d@@ k : you know , i think there &apos;s recognition for the role of happiness in politics .
the recognition will be slowly in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , it &apos;s happening right now , and in other countries , they just happen .
people tend to realize that they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will discuss whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life review , so we have to get this discussion pretty soon .
how to increase happiness is very different on how you think and whether you think about it , or whether you think about the living self .
this will affect politics , i think , in the coming years .
in the united states , you get to measure the experience happiness of the population .
this will be , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national statistics .
now , it seems to me , this issue , or should at least be the most interesting political debate to pursue the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you danny ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man .
i &apos;m jane mc@@ gon@@ ig@@ al . i design games .
i &apos;ve been developing online games now , and my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy to save the world in reality , as they &apos;re saving in online games .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including all of them , spend more time with games and playing games .
at the moment , we spend three billion hours a week with online play .
some of you might think , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe something too much time when you think about how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
but , in fact , my research on the institute for the future is the exact opposite .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to solve the most urgent problems in the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase that time .
i &apos;ve calculated that it &apos;s time for 21 billion hours a week .
that seems to be something that you might think about , so i can make it possible , so i can make it work , like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity , i think we need to try and play games online for least 21 billion hours to the end of the next decade .
no , i really mean it .
why ? this picture is very precisely what i think games are so essential to the survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a por@@ ype of the photographer phil pyth@@ to@@ le@@ o .
he wanted to capture the feelings in playing . so he was building a camera .
this is one of the classic words playing .
if you &apos;re not a player , maybe some of the nu@@ ances are in this picture .
you probably see this sense of urgency , kind of fear , but also the very first concentration , it &apos;s a really difficult problem .
now , if you play , you see a few pairs here that look up , and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebro@@ ws show surprise .
this is a player that stands on the edge of a epic pack .
oh , you know that . ok . pri@@ ma . so we have some players here .
an epic victory is a result that &apos;s so very positive that they didn &apos;t know that it was possible at all .
it was almost like imagination .
and if you do it , they &apos;re shocked that they &apos;re actually being able to do something like this . this is an epic victory .
this player is just a epic victory .
and this is what we need to see in millions of faces of proble@@ m-@@ solving around the world , if we take the barriers to attack the next century , the face of the people who are at the end of all the wi@@ dri@@ ties on the edge of an epic pack .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re looking at this face in real life when we have difficult problems .
i call it &quot; in life , &quot; i &apos;m bad , &quot; and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok . ok .
i &apos;m like , &quot; in life , i &apos;m bad . &quot;
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied in my ph.d. , why we are better in games than in real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not as good as play in reality .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , even though that &apos;s about it .
we &apos;re doing more in games more . i mean , in the context of the motivation , to do something more significant , inspired with each other .
if we are in a game world , i believe that many of us will turn into our best version , at anytime and immediately help and help , try to solve the problem as long as necessary to try it again .
and in reality , if we fail to collapse on obstacles , we &apos;re often feeling different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel to fear . we feel threatened , perhaps depressed , frustrated or zy@@ n@@ ic .
and we never have these feelings when we play games , they just don &apos;t exist .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to explore as a graduate student .
why isn &apos;t it possible in games to think , you couldn &apos;t just achieve anything ?
how can we transfer these feelings into reality ?
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft , which offers the ideal environment to the collective problem .
and i &apos;ve noticed some things that make epic gains in online worlds as possible .
so , first of all , when you get in one of these online games , especially at the world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are willing to trust you , and that &apos;s immediately .
but not just a mission , but a mission that fits perfect to your current level , right ?
so , you can do that .
you never get a task you can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of their capabilities , so they have to do it , but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around and you turn around . there &apos;s always something important to do .
and there &apos;s a staff .
where you go , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to end their epic mission .
this is not so easy to do in real life , this sense that in a finger@@ bag , a staff is ready .
and also , there &apos;s this epic story , this inspiring story , why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
you &apos;ve heard of &quot; level level &quot; and &quot; + 1 strength &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot;
this constant feedback is not in real life .
if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have the voice + + 1 , plus one crazy idea , plus 20 insane idea .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in real life .
so , the problem of the cooperative online worlds like the world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to stand at anytime on the edge of an epic , that we &apos;d rather spend our time in these toys .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all the world world &apos;s world players have spent 5.@@ 93 million years to solve the virtual problems of a@@ jad .
it &apos;s not necessarily bad .
it might sound nasty .
but in order to see the context , 5.@@ 93 million years ago , our first pri@@ ma@@ en ancestors began to go upright .
so the first exciting primate .
ok , so , if we talk about how much time we spend playing games , this just makes sense when you think about the time in terms of the scale of human development , which is extraordinary .
but also , it turns out , because it turns out that , by using this whole time , we &apos;re actually going to change what we are as humans .
we &apos;re developing ourselves to collaborative , you know .
that &apos;s the truth . i think .
once you look at this interesting statistic that recently was published by a researcher of carnegie mellon university , the average young man from today in a country with massive play culture spends 10,000 hours of online play to the 21st years .
so , 10,000 hours is an extremely interesting number of reasons .
first of all , for kids in the united states , 10@@ .@@ 0@@ 80 hours is the accurate amount of resources that they spend in school , from five to high school -- if you never miss .
so what we have here is a complete parallel training where young people are learning about what it means to be a good player , like everything else you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of malcolm gla@@ dwell , &quot; over@@ airplane , &quot; read .
so , you know , the theory of success , the theory of the 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science , that , when we spend 10,000 hours of the dawn of a single difference to the 21st year , we &apos;re going to master .
we &apos;re going to be so good at what &apos;s the most important people in the world .
so what we have here is an entire generation of young people who are masterpieces .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are players kidding ? &quot;
because if we could figure this out , we would have never done the unprecedented human potential .
so many people are now in the world that spend at least one hour per day with online play .
these are our masterpieces . 500 million people who are extraordinarily good at &quot; something . &quot;
and the next decade , we have another billion players that are extraordinarily good at whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the games of play that are developing energy and working on mobile nets , instead of the broad@@ band internet , rather than the broad@@ band of the world , especially in india , in china , are able to play online .
you expect an additional billion players in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion players total .
so i started thinking about what it &apos;s to do , which is to make us master .
here are the four things that i found . first of denial optimism .
ok , imagine how extreme self-@@ motivated is .
dis@@ valu@@ ity optimism is the desire to do things immediately , to master a barrier , with the belief that we have created hope for success .
players always believe that an epic victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth to try and it &apos;s the same .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters in the spiders .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show people more like that after we played them with them , even when they beat us badly .
the reason for this is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone .
we trust that somebody will spend time with us that the rules will be made , that we have the same goal , and we have to get to the playing .
so this is allowing us to grow up by commitment , trust and with each other .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
good productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of warm players playing 22 hours a week , as a result of time .
and the reason is , when we play , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard , than when we relax or nothing .
we know that we think of as human beings when we do hard , significant work .
and players are always willing to work hard if they get the right task .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love to become part of awe of planetary missions .
this is a back@@ point of india to put that on the right , you know , all wikipedia , the biggest wiki of the world .
the second philosopher in the world , almost 8@@ 0,000 posts , is the world of warcraft wiki .
five million people use it every month .
they put together more information on the world of warcraft on the internet than any other topic in every other wiki of the world .
they create an epic story .
they create an epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four super@@ forces that lead to a single outcome . players are super-@@ powerful , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world .
and the only problem is that you think you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward ca@@ ct@@ o@@ va is a census scientist .
his work is great . he studies why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worlds .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to be a witness of not less than a mass spill in virtual worlds and online play environments . &quot;
and this is an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like me , i design games , i &apos;m a little bit overwhelmed .
so he says that actually makes sense , because player can reach more in online worlds than in real life .
they can make more powerful social bonds in games than in real life . they get more feedback and rewards in games than in real life .
so , he says it &apos;s perfectly logical at the moment that gam@@ ers spend more time in the virtual world than they were in real school .
i just agree , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not an optical situation .
we need to begin to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that comes back 2,500 years .
there are these ancient cube from sheep . you know ?
in front of this fantastic game controllers , sheep &apos;s box@@ ate .
and these were kind of the first people we used to do .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the working greek historian of the old greek historian , you know , you may know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us games , games are made , in the kingdom , in the kingdom of a famine .
there was such a great famine that the king of ly@@ dies decided to get into a crazy idea .
people suffered . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so , they invented , according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , the box game , and a national strategy , you would eat food . the next day you would play .
and they would be very immer@@ sed so much into the box , because games are so fascinating , and with satisfying , productivity productivity surrounded by productivity that they had nothing to eat .
and then , the next day , you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , they survived this famine for 18 years , by eating them on a day and playing the next one .
in the same way , i think we &apos;re playing games today .
we have games to get out of the world suffering .
we put games in order to dis@@ take everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , everything that &apos;s not satisfying in real life , and we get what we need to play .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s exciting .
according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , after 18 years , famine wasn &apos;t better , so the king decided to make a last pu@@ ke .
they shared the kingdom into two .
they played a box game , and the sie@@ ger would get to an epic adventure .
they left ly@@ dies , and they went to the search for a new home , and they just let so many people go back , and they were looking for the rest of it , and they were looking for the rest of a place where they could survive .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest dna evidence shows that the et@@ rus , that later the roman empire , is the same dna as the old ly@@ er .
so scientists started to think that her@@ od@@ ot@@ us &apos;s license is actually true .
and geologists found evidence of a global tide that took almost 20 years to explain what famine could explain .
so this crazy story could vote .
you might actually have saved their people through games using 18 years in games for 18 years , and then they had that environment and they learned so much about each other that they saved the whole civilization .
so , we can .
we &apos;ve been playing warcraft since 1994 .
this was the first strategy in the world , in real time , of the world &apos;s bank series , which was 16 years ago .
they played 18 years of swimming , and we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epic game .
so , they sent half of their civilization to look for a new world , so i take my 21 billion toys a week .
we should think that half of us spend one hour a day with play , until we &apos;ve solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve the real world in games ? &quot; and exactly that question , i &apos;ve dedicated my work to work on the future for the future .
we have this ban@@ ner in our office in pal@@ o al@@ to , it press how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to think about the best answer , and then people tend to make this idea in reality .
we imagine epic wins , and we give people the opportunity to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you just three games that i &apos;ve created to try and get people to get epic wins in their own future .
this is &quot; the world without oil . &quot;
the game is by 2007 .
it &apos;s an online game where you have to get through an oil scarcity .
the oil scarcity is invented , but we have enough online content so that it will be realistic for it , and it &apos;s real life , and it &apos;s , you know , how food is used , and , you know , how food is closed -- and you have to figure out how to make your real life , and you have to figure out how to make your real life , if it &apos;s true , and you have to figure out how to make your real life , you know , videos or photos .
we tested this game with 1,@@ 700 gam@@ ers in 2007 , and we &apos;ve accompanied it since the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was changing experience .
no one wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in an epic adventure , and i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to take oil . &quot;
this is an amazing adventure that you &apos;re going to do .
find out how they would survive . most of our players have been in the game .
so , for the next world record , we have a bigger , higher goal than just oil scarcity .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; super@@ stru@@ ct . &quot;
the point is , the computation of a supercomputer is that people just have 23 years left on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global exit system , &quot; of course .
the call of player to match , we &apos;ve got almost like a ca@@ r@@ y-@@ bru@@ sty film .
you know jerry bru@@ ck@@ s &apos;s movies , where it &apos;s called the &quot; machine team , &quot; and you have the astronauts , the scientists , the president , and only together , you can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , everybody is in the bin team , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
and 8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read , if you google &quot; super@@ stru@@ ct . &quot;
and the last game , we put out on march on march , and it &apos;s in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you get the world bank , the world bank , &quot; social retro@@ age , &quot; 2010 .
we work with universities throughout sub-saharan africa , and we have a company to learn social change .
we have a comic book . we have &quot; level high &quot; for local sense of knowledge , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i &apos;d like to invite you all to share this game with young people all around the world , especially in developing areas , especially in developmental areas that benefit together to save their own social enterprise to save the world .
i &apos;ll end up with the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope that , i hope , that gam@@ ers are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a great meaning for change .
we &apos;ve got all these super@@ powers , happiness productivity , the ability to make open social nets , dis@@ comfort optimism , and the desire for epic meaning .
i really hope we &apos;re playing significant games to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope you &apos;ll design and play with me like this .
if i look at the next decade , i &apos;m sure about two things : that we can create any future , and we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start the world changing games .
thank you .
i would like to tell you something , which is a few months ago , i &apos;d like to write to you a couple of months ago .
i used to write in the writing of my syn@@ ony@@ m dictionary , but i was ready with the process of the robot , and i noticed that i &apos;ve never been in my life what the word &quot; genius &quot; really means .
i &apos;ll read you the post .
&quot; disabled , ad@@ je@@ ctive , ad@@ je@@ ctive , &quot; the helpless , in@@ effective , in@@ effective , destroyed , di@@ wed , mu@@ wed , di@@ wed , di@@ wed , di@@ wed , di@@ wed , un@@ discrimin@@ ated , di@@ wed , un@@ discrimin@@ ated , un@@ inhabited , un@@ inhabited , un@@ inhabited , un@@ fu@@ wed , weak and weak .
ant@@ ony@@ me : healthy , strong , powerful .
i read this list in a friend for a friend , and i had to laugh , it worked so ridiculous , but i just got to say , &quot; and i could get to read , and i had to stop reading , and i had to stop reading , and i had to start reading , and i had to start reading , and i had to start to read , and i had to start reading , and i had to start reading , and i had to start reading , and i had to start reading
of course , this was an editor , old syn@@ ony@@ ra dictionary , and i just thought that the issue must be pretty old .
but in fact , it was an issue in the early 1980s , when i just started elementary school , and i started building my own image outside of my family circle and to form , also , to other kids and the rest of the world around me .
and thank god i was not used syn@@ ony@@ -@@ dictionary then .
if i would take this post seriously , i would be born in a world that would be able to perceive me as a person who would be able to be positive in somebody &apos;s way , but now i &apos;m going to be celebrated for the opportunities and adventures i &apos;ve experienced .
so , i immediately called the online copy of 2009 , and i would expect you to find a match here .
here &apos;s the current version of this compound .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
in particular , the last two words under &quot; permanently syn@@ ony@@ ms , &quot; &quot; &quot; all &quot; and healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about the people we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and people around us .
many ancient societies , including the greek and the roman , have really believed that the language of a plane has a huge force , because what you &apos;re talking about is also true .
so , what do we really want to manifest -- a disabled person or a powerful people ?
in fact , a human being is less mind@@ less than a kid , could be able to put them up and give them ideas .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open doors ?
one person who opened doors for me was the pediatrician at the a.@@ i. du@@ pont institute in wil@@ m@@ ington .
it &apos;s dr. pi@@ z@@ ul@@ ti@@ gle . an it@@ al american , whose name , as you can think , that most americans couldn &apos;t speak correctly . so he &apos;s always been called dr. p. .
and dr. p. always wore very colorful flies , and it was just for work with kids .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- to my physiological therapy .
and i had to make them seem to have an awful lot of action with this intense , el@@ astic rock -- in different colors -- in different colors -- in different colors -- and i hate them . i hate them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them .
and imagine , i &apos;ve been in fact as a five-@@ year kid with dr. p. , trying to stop this work , more natural .
and one day , he looked at me in one of my practices -- this exercise was just ti@@ ring and grace -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a powerful , powerful and young girl , you &apos;re being broken one day .
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
and that was , of course , just a very simple trick by dr. p. , so i &apos;m doing the work that i don &apos;t want to do , the prospect that the most amazing five year-old girl in the hospital at the next floor , but he actually brought me to see my daily mundane horror .
and i wonder today how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful and powerful girl shaped my own image , and i could think of myself as being a very strong , powerful and at@@ matic person .
this is just an example of many , how adults can make in power positions of a child .
but , as the people who have already proven from the syn@@ ony@@ mus dictionaries , our language doesn &apos;t allow us to imagine something that we would all wish to be able to allow anyone to see themselves as being more powerful people .
our language reli@@ es the society changes that has been caused in many cases through a technological change .
from the medical point of view , of course , you can say that my legs , the laser surgery for vision , k@@ low joints from titan and artificial hip joints for the age of titan and artificial hip joints for aging that allow people to be able to use their possibilities , and the boundaries that allow them to be able to be able to use their own identity , and on the boundaries that they choose .
so , you may be able to think about this technological change more clearly because of the fact that there &apos;s always been a different truth , which is that every person in society can be something entirely special and very powerful , and that the human ability is to adapt , our biggest plus .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people are always asking me to talk about how i &apos;m going to talk about , and i &apos;m going to tell you , and i &apos;m going to tell you , that sentence never looked for me , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable about that , and i think , i think , why .
and this sentence of the relationship with the idea is that success or happiness depends on the idea of being a challenge , without being able to be shaped by the subject of the subject , as if my life was so successful , because i was able to be able to be able to go through a prosthetic .
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing . of course , we &apos;re changing by the challenge , whether it &apos;s physical , emotional or even .
and i &apos;m saying that that &apos;s good .
it &apos;s not a obstacle that we have to move on to our lives better .
it &apos;s just to our lives .
and i tend to look at it as my shadow .
sometimes i realize it &apos;s very present , sometimes it &apos;s hardly to see , but it &apos;s constantly with me .
and i don &apos;t want to make the impact or the hard impact of a human race .
it &apos;s in life and challenges , and they &apos;re just real real , and each person is going to be different , but the question isn &apos;t whether we &apos;re going to be able to come or not , but how we get to it .
so , we &apos;re not just responsible for the people we love to maintain fortune attacks , but they &apos;re also willing to make it clear .
and we don &apos;t like our kids if we give them a sense that they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to be able to separate two things : for one the medical fact , to be ampu@@ tated , and the other social opinion is whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and running disability that i had to put apart is that the world is constantly , it could describe me with this definitions .
in our wish to protect the people who are in the heart , and tell them the cool , hard truth about their medical projections , or even a correlation to the quality of life that they expect , we have to think that we don &apos;t have to be disabled .
maybe this is the present concept that &apos;s just tracking what &apos;s going on in a broken , and how we fix it , for each individual more disability than the path@@ ology itself .
if we don &apos;t care about human beings , and not all the forces and possibilities , we can see , in addition to the natural struggle that you might have to lead to , another disease .
we have a people who have value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the pat@@ ology and focus on all the field of human possibilities .
most importantly , it is that it &apos;s between the perception of our suffering and our great invention , a connection .
we should not dis@@ act these challenges , or deny , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , we should be able to get them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about recognizing opportunities .
i think maybe it &apos;s possible to make sure that we don &apos;t necessarily have to get rid of them , but that we &apos;re open to it , to hug them , to put them on a fight , and maybe even to dance with it .
and maybe we &apos;re able to see it as something natural , consistent and useful , and we don &apos;t feel that way .
in this year , we celebrate the 200 , by charles darwin , and when he wrote about evolution about 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , represented something very true in human character .
i would write it like this : not the most powerful of his species survived , and not the most intelligent of his way , but the one that changes changes .
from conflicts , creativity emerges creativity .
not just from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of the people to survive and to flourish , from the struggle of the human mind , is defined by conflict .
so again , change and adaptation are the greatest capabilities of people .
and maybe we only know what wood we &apos;re vaccin@@ ated when we &apos;re really testing .
perhaps that &apos;s the point of wi@@ dri@@ dom , a perception of the ion , a sense of our own force .
we can give ourselves something like this .
we can give them a new meaning that goes beyond hard times .
maybe we can see the change as change .
it &apos;s a change for change that we have not adapted to .
i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve added to ourselves is to believe we should be normal .
honestly , who &apos;s normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
it &apos;s common . the typical , but not the normal , and would you really want to know this poor , gray person , if you really would know ?
i don &apos;t think so .
it would be great , if we think about this pattern of normal@@ ity versus the possibility of the possibilities , or the strength , could be able to put it in a little more dangerous way , so we can put the forces from very many kids , and invite them to provide their very special and valuable skills in society .
mauritius has found that we have been people from the members of our society , to be able to be useful and to contribute .
well , there &apos;s evidence that the neanderthals of the neanderthals have been in charge and people with heavy physical injuries , and that might happen because the life-@@ life experience in survival was valuable for society .
they have not seen these people as being broken and useless ; they &apos;ve been treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i was in the town where i grew up in a food market in the northeast zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing there in front of a wa@@ p-@@ el toma@@ toes .
it was summer , and i was .
and i hear like a guy behind me , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mul@@ lin@@ s . &quot;
and i &apos;m around and i see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you &apos;re not going to remember me .
when i first saw her , i brought her out of her mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
oh , so .
and , of course , it made a click .
this was dr. ke@@ an , a man i knew just from narratives of my mother about this day , because i was , of course , a very typical , two weeks later .
the doctor for pr@@ g@@ at@@ al diagnosis of my mother was in the holiday , and my parents had the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born with no wa@@ ck legs , and my feet were going to take care of them , and i just had a few toes on this one and a few toes on the other foot , he had to get the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk , and never be able to be able to be like other children , or you could never have an independent life , and i &apos;ve just been lying . &quot;
in fact , i found the fact that he had collected newspapers from my entire childhood , whether i had won with a letter competition in the second grade , whether i was in the quest to speak to hal@@ lo@@ a , whether i was in the quest to speak to hal@@ lo@@ a , whether i was in the quest to teach her students , medical school students , and he used to use those clips to teach his students , medical school students and the her@@ s@@ hey medical school .
and he called this part of his curator , the x factor , the potential of human being .
you can &apos;t emphasize enough how crucial this factor can be for people &apos;s quality of life .
and dr. ke@@ an continued to tell , he said , &quot; i learned that kids , if they &apos;re not going to get anything else , and even if they give kids a little bit , then they can achieve a lot . &quot;
see , dr. ke@@ an has changed his thinking .
he understood that the medical diagnosis , and how somebody manage it , are two different things .
and also , i &apos;ve been thinking about the course of time , if you &apos;ve been asked me at the age of 15 , if i was in the age of the age of meat and bone , i would not have been shy of a second .
i really wanted to act normal .
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs and not despite this experience .
and maybe this change could happen , because i &apos;ve been involved in so many people who opened doors to the doors , instead of people who would dis@@ count me or give me an idea .
you see , it really takes a people to show them how they can manifest their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to activate their own inner forces , the human mind is so intimi@@ dating -- if you do that , and for anyone to open a door , you &apos;re a very good teacher .
they bring them to open doors .
the real meaning of the word &quot; manifest@@ ing &quot; in the word &quot; reagan . &quot;
it means something that is in one is to tick@@ le the potential .
again , what potential would we like to call ?
in the 1960s , in the u.k. , there was a case study in the u.k. , and then , you know , asia was turned in in schools .
they call this &quot; pro@@ aming trials &quot; in the united states that we call &quot; tracking . &quot;
the students are raised to grades .
and the a student will test coins harder , the better teachers , etc .
they then gave them over a three-@@ month period of time students with a &quot; sufficient &quot; the grade , and they were told they were very smart , and , after this three months , they really wrote .
and , of course , it breaks to hear the heart that the opposite students was told , they &apos;re just enough .
and it was also the same after the three months .
but only those who were still in school -- except from the students who had failed school .
the key thing about this study was that the teachers were not balanced .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they just said that they were the student students , and they &apos;re the students with the note enough , and they &apos;ve taught them something and treated them .
the only real disability is a broken mind that was broken , has no hope , has no hope anymore . he doesn &apos;t find any more beauty . it doesn &apos;t take our natural , childhood sense of imagination .
but if we can do it , to support the human mind , continue to be able to be able to be nice , and other people around them to be beautiful , curious and advent@@ ur@@ ful , then we have our forces really positive .
if a mind about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new species .
i &apos;d like to end with a poem that was written by an persi@@ an poet called ha@@ fi@@ z in the 14@@ th century , telling me about my friend jacques &apos;s name , and the poem is called &quot; the god who knows only four words , not the god who knows only four words , not the god who knows only four words , not the god who knows only four words . &quot;
come on , dance with me . thank you .
how would they be better than they &apos;re currently ?
suppose i said , through very few changes of their genes , a better memory could have -- more precise , more and faster .
or , you want to be more subtle , more powerful .
do you want more attractive and more confident ?
how would it be to live longer in good health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who have always been more creativity .
which would you like most ?
which would you like to have if you could have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about as many as it is there .
it &apos;s very good .
how many would be deciding for good memory ?
a few more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to see , as a doctor .
if you could have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is this just education ?
or is it possible ?
evolution has been a ongoing topic here on the ted conference , but today , i want to give you the idea of a doctor .
the great geneti@@ cists in the 20th century , according to tra@@ do@@ b@@ z@@ han@@ sky , who was also a census in the russian orthodox church , once , once , said , &quot; nothing in biology does not make sense in the light of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the evidence of biological evolution , this would be a very good time to get out of your hearing device , you &apos;re going to take your personal communication device -- i &apos;ll give you permission , and maybe you can take a look at kathryn schul@@ tz &apos;s book , and you can take a look at it .
but if you accept biological evolution , you think this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
it &apos;s for others , or does it matter ?
this is another view of the tree of life .
in this picture , i &apos;ve laid a bush to the center of the branches in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all the creatures in the tops of these branches have been successful in evolutionary opinion : they survived ; it has survived its environment ; it has doubled its environment .
the human part of this book , far at the end , is , of course , what we &apos;re most interested in .
we divide from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , perhaps 20 or 25 different kinds of homini@@ ds .
some of them have come and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about 13@@ 0,000 years .
it seems like we &apos;re quite remote from the other parts of the building of life , but in fact , most of the fundamental mechanisms of our cells are quite the same .
so , is it clear that we can use it , and the mechanisms of a common bacterium can be shown to produce the protein of the human insulin , which is used to treat diabe@@ tics ?
this is not like human@@ insulin ; this is the same protein , it &apos;s chemi@@ cally unpredictable from what comes from the wheel .
and as we talk about bacteria , we realize that every one of us in our inte@@ stine is more bacterial than the other cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times .
i mean , you think , if antonio dama@@ si@@ o , after your personal image , are you thinking about bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderfully hospit@@ able environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s fire , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to give them all the nutrients that you could just wish without making a effort .
it &apos;s really a lighter way for bacteria , with occasi@@ onal sub@@ pair@@ ings of unintended , je@@ od@@ esday forced to follow .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as they matter for their lives .
they help in the di@@ gestion of essential nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will happen in the future ?
are we in a kind of evolutionary equilibrium in the form of a species species ?
or are we supposed to be something different -- something that might even be adapted to the environment ?
now , let &apos;s take a step back to the big bang , 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago , perhaps about four and four billion years ago , perhaps three to four billion years ago , in the world , and then the human species , which is in the last 13@@ 0,000 years .
in this vast incomplete symphony of the universe , life on earth is just very short ; the animal kingdom , like a single one , and of human life , a small amount of reference .
that &apos;s us .
this also provides the entertainment value of this talk , so i hope that i enjoy it .
now , when i was in college , i had my first biology class .
i was fascinated by the elegan@@ ce and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i was making something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in individual organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is going to continue in both tofu cells .
but at the time , when the multi-@@ metric organisms showed up , the things began to change .
sexual reproduction comes in .
and most importantly , with the introduction of sexual reproduction that the genome continues , the rest of the body becomes more dama@@ sive .
in fact , you could say that the inevitable death of the death of our body is going to happen at the same time as sexual reproduction .
now , i &apos;ve got to say , if i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death of sex -- it seemed pretty sensible at the time , but with every year , it has come to my increasing questioning .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burn , which in las vegas led his show in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his hotel bank door .
he opens the door .
in front of him , it &apos;s an amazing professional girl .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for superman . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization as a doctor that i was doing a goal that was different than the goal of evolution -- not inevitable , just different .
i &apos;ve tried to maintain the body .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i wanted to re@@ create health for disease .
i wanted us to make a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the continuing of the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival to generation .
from an evolutionary point of view , they are , and i &apos;ve developed , like boo@@ ster rockets , to send the genetic questions into the next stage of the orbit , to go into the ocean .
i think we would all get the mood , the woo@@ dy all of them got to understand , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get im@@ mortality through my work .
i want to reach it by not mortal . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean to prefer the longest life .
it &apos;s not inevitable to the highest , the most powerful or the fastest , and not even the bri@@ ghtest .
evolution provides the creatures that adapt best to their environment .
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , there are bacteria that are ther@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ l , and by using the hot steam , otherwise if fish were there , there would be a vacuum fish , yet , you have been able to do it there .
so , what does this mean when we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the place in evolution , and most of all , as we expect to look at the next phase , i would say there &apos;s a range of possibilities .
the first one is we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we have a kind of equilibrium .
and the reason for this would be that it &apos;s been given us by medicine , we &apos;ve done a lot of genes that otherwise had been chosen and had been removed from the population .
and secondly , we have as a species of our environment so that we have managed to adapt to us , and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we go and we wander and we &apos;re going so much that you can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary , for evolution , for evolution .
a second possibility is that it will be a evolution of the traditional way , of course , spreading by nature &apos;s forces .
and the argument , here would be that the wheels of evolution are slow up slowly , but they &apos;re im@@ fil@@ ed .
and so far as isolation , if we eliminate the distant planet as a species , it becomes insul@@ ation and the changes of the environment that might produce evolution in a natural way .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , an obligation , fascinating and terrifying possibility .
i call it ne@@ o-@@ evolution -- the new development that isn &apos;t just , of course , but followed by us as individuals , in the decisions we do .
now , how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s first look at the reality that people today are making decisions about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and family choose .
so , think , if it &apos;s not just possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to make genetic adap@@ tations that would heal disease and prevent disease .
what if you could make the genetic changes , to get diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s or alzheimer &apos;s risk , or tolerance ?
would you not want to make these changes in your genes ?
if we predict , this kind of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost 2.@@ 7 billion dollars .
in the following year , when it was done in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in dr@@ a to four months .
today , you can see a sequence of the three billion bases of the human genome to a price of about 20,000 and in the space of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take long , until the reality will be that there will be 1,000 dollars of human genomes , and it will increasingly be available for everybody .
in front of a week , the national academy of engineering is the dramatic academy of engineering for francis arnold and wil@@ mentally ste@@ mmer , two scientists who developed independent techniques to work on the natural process of evolution -- which fran@@ ces arnold calls direct evolution .
a few years ago , the laser price of sh@@ in@@ ya yam@@ an@@ aka was convicted of his research in which he was taking a grow@@ er , a vascular , and by the manipulation of only four genes , the cell , and by the manipulation of just four genes , to go back to the light of any cell in your body .
these changes are coming .
the same technology that can produce the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that can &apos;t just protect itself , but also for the imm@@ unity to other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in gang with influenza in the cells of a tobacco plant .
can you imagine something good from tobacco ?
this is all reality today , and in the future , it will be much more possible .
now , imagine two other small changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells ?
what if you could change the sperm and protein , or the fresh fertili@@ zed egg , to give your kids a better chance for a healthier life -- eliminating diabetes , eliminating the he@@ m@@ op@@ hil@@ y , eliminating the risk of cancer ?
who don &apos;t want kids to healthier ?
and then the analy@@ tic technology , the same engine of science that can enable the changes to prevent disease , could allow us to be able to be able to ass@@ tate to be able to be able to be able to kill them , hyper-@@ capacity , hyper-@@ capacity .
why don &apos;t we have the ability of an ken jen@@ rus , especially if you can expand it with the next generation of the wat@@ o machine ?
why not have the fast muscle fibers that will allow them to run faster and longer ?
why no longer live ?
it will be limitless .
and if we &apos;re in a place where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want , we will be transformed by the fossil style evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that might require 100,000 years , and we can get it into a thousand years -- and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions that have their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , to be around .
are we using these choices to form a society that is better , which is more friendly ?
or will we choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others ?
are we going to form a society of di@@ el@@ ity and uni@@ oma , or more robust and more abundant ?
these are the kinds of questions we have to be facing .
and the deepest of all , we will ever be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom that we need to make that decision ?
the good ones like evil , and as you might think , you &apos;re going to be those decisions .
thank you .
i want you to imagine , you know , a portable robot that gives you over@@ human capabilities , or another , which helps you to stand up and get up and get up .
we at berkeley bi@@ onics call these robots autonomous skeletons .
they &apos;re nothing other than something they put them in the morning and give them extra strength , and that will increase their velocity and help them keep their balance .
it &apos;s actually the true denial of human and machine .
but not just that -- to put it together and connect it with the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just an insane idea .
now , to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers , which is about 100 pounds on your back , and it &apos;s the question that you should carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major compli@@ cations -- spinal injuries , 30 percent of them -- chronic spinal injuries .
so we thought we would embrace this challenge and create an exotic skeleton that would help interact with this problem .
so let me introduce you to hul@@ c now -- or the human being universal placebo .
soldier : with the hul@@ c exotic skeleton , i can carry 200 pounds across different kinds of terrain , many hours .
his flexible design allows it to be deep down , to go deep and have highly mobile movement .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and then increase my strength and then .
we &apos;re so far to imagine our industrial partners , this new exotic skeleton in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
now let &apos;s look at our look at the wheel@@ ets , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people sitting globally in the wheelchair .
it &apos;s about one percent of the population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about very young people with spinal cord injuries that are in the dry days of their lives -- in 20@@ he , &apos; 30s , &apos; 40s , and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population , whose number is multiplied .
and so quite the only option -- if it comes to a brain beat , or other compli@@ cations -- is the wheelchair .
and , by the way , it &apos;s been about 500 years since his , as i have to say , is very successful .
so we thought we could start writing a completely new chapter in mobility .
now , let me introduce you to imagine that by amanda box@@ tel , which is 19 years ago , a spinal market injury , which is to think that she could not walk more and more and more now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda carries our mouth .
it has sensors .
his completely non-@@ invasive sensors in the cru@@ ches , the signals back to our on@@ board computer , which is attached here on your back .
now , here &apos;s a battery drill , and the motor drive is in their hat@@ s , as well as they are , as they move forward in this very smooth and very natural way .
i was 24 years old , and in best form , as a mon@@ cet pur@@ ase , while a ski ride was paralyzed .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement underneath my orbit .
not long after this , a doctor in my hospital , and he said , &quot; amanda , you will never go again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he steel every day of hope from my consciousness .
ada@@ pt@@ able technology has ever been able to learn to climb again , climb again and even drive with the hands .
but nothing was invented to let me go back until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the whole potential here to change life from the future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda here and all the wheel@@ ets , but for everyone .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m head of the development department of a non-profit organization called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t fought poverty , i &apos;m going to fought as a fire@@ host of a fire@@ war in a volunteer prison .
now , in our city , in which volunteers supported a highly trained professional budget , you have to be pretty early at the time to be able to mix .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer in the brand , so i had pretty good opportunities .
but it was still against the other volunteers to reach and find out what our jobs would be .
when i found the main man , he had just been in a very serious conversation with the home dancer who certainly had one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she used to be in the sleep train and bar@@ m under a screen in the shallow rain while her house was in fl@@ ames .
the other volunteers that came close to me -- we call him le@@ x brothers -- reached the main man as first and was asked to go into the house and save the dog &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was deaf .
there was any lawyer or wealth , which is now for the rest of his life to tell people that he went into a burning of the house to save a living living , just because he was five seconds faster than me .
now , i was the next .
the main man came to me .
he said , &quot; dar@@ s , you have to go into the house .
you have to go up , you have to go up , and you have to get a pair of shoes . &quot;
i swear it .
now , not exactly what i was hoping to do , but i went out -- the tre@@ bs up , the flight , to the &quot; real fire@@ men , &quot; which at that point was already finished to catch a pair of shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i had my prey back down to where i met my throat and the loved dog .
we wore our imagination out to the outside , where , not surprisingly , he got more attention than mine than mine .
a couple of weeks later , the fire@@ prize got a letter of the house , where she was in charge of your house .
one of them over@@ stated kindness : somebody had brought her a few shoes .
and in my job at robin hood and also in my side career , i &apos;m a witness of generosity and kindness in the big scale , but i also see the love and the mu@@ ts of individuals .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so , if i look around this room and see people who either have been successful , or on their way up , i would like to offer the following memory : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait for making a difference in the lives of another , until they &apos;ve reached their first million .
if you give them something , they give it now .
use in a food kitchen , put a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day will give us a chance to save the lives of a human person , but every day gives us the possibility to change one .
so put it on ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno gu@@ is@@ san@@ i : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret of humankind .
a place where women are doing the most popul@@ ous , with sex &apos; hi , and the game determines the day -- where fun is serious .
and no , it &apos;s not snack or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their relatives .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the congo forest of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our closest living relatives .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago .
now , chimpanzees are known for their aggressive standards .
but unfortunately , we over@@ stated this aspect in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the me@@ dal .
in fact , in the chimpanzees of large , scary coins , the civilian society is led by empowerment of empowerment .
they really have come up with this , because this leads to a very low-@@ tolerance society that has not been observed already .
but unfortunately , bonobos are least known to the primates .
they &apos;re living in the depths of the con@@ gol@@ ese basin , and the observation is just heavy .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the scene of a violent argument that has been used for decades and nearly as many lives as the first world war .
it &apos;s not surprising that this destruction is also threatened by the bonobos .
meat trade and the decline of the tree is that you could not even fill a stadium with the wings , and you &apos;re not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a hidden laugh , that the trees blow away .
who are these relatives ?
we know it as &quot; love instead of war &quot; monkeys , because they &apos;ve got common , bis@@ ex@@ ual sex , with interacting partners , and rules as conflicts and social accounting .
i don &apos;t say , that would be the answer to all the humanitarian problems -- because the bonobos &apos;s life is more than the camel .
bonobos -- like people -- love to play their lives .
play doesn &apos;t just mean toys .
for us , it &apos;s essential to the connection of relationships and the care of tolerance .
that &apos;s what we trust and the rules of the game .
play is increasing creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about generating diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of behaviors .
and when you watch bonobos in play , you see the evolutionary origins of human la@@ ps , dance and rituals .
play is the tick@@ t that holds us together .
now , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique images straight from the wild .
first of all , a balloon of vulnerability -- and i don &apos;t think about football .
so here we see a young female and males in a track game .
look at what it does .
this could be the evolutionary origin of , &quot; you put it in the eggs . &quot;
except , i think it &apos;s like him , not true .
yeah .
so sex games are common , both at bonobos and people .
and this video is really interesting , because it &apos;s really interesting , because this video is really interesting , because it &apos;s going to show the idea where you put new elements in the game -- like the te@@ te@@ te@@ te@@ ation -- and also , how the game is doing both trust as well .
but the game is a formal transducer .
play is a formal gesture , and it can take a lot of forms that some of them are quiet , imaginative , curious -- perhaps to discover the startling again .
and i want to show you , this is fu@@ ku , a young female , and it &apos;s playing with water .
i think exactly how you play sometimes , sometimes , and we look at the limitations of our inner and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us explore , and interact , and the unexpected curves that we create is the real supply of creativity .
this is just a small taste of the insights that bonobos gave us in our past and present .
but it &apos;s also a secret for our future , a future that we have to adapt to , in increasing challenges , by greater creativity and dru@@ cting cooperation .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our ada@@ yo@@ cian .
we have to be successfully sensitive to an un@@ inhabited world , we need to play .
but will we make the best of our game drive ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and humans , the lives are equal to the teeth and claws alone .
now , if it &apos;s hardly appropriate , play is perhaps the most urgent .
and therefore , my pri@@ ma@@ ten@@ te@@ mates , let &apos;s embrace this gift of evolution and play together while we &apos;re sharing creativity the camera and the wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs , in mid@@ 1979 , the same day , at the same time , the same moment , every single one is a baby -- okay .
so two pairs , each one is a baby .
now , i don &apos;t want them to think too much time , because , if you think about the whole time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
now , think about this for a moment .
and in this scenario , imagine that in a case , the sperm is an y ch@@ om@@ o@@ an , which hits the x chromosome of the egg .
and in the other case , the sperm gives a x chromosome that hits the x chromosome of the egg .
both are survival , both light .
we go back to these people later .
in most of my activities , i got two hat@@ s .
under a hat , i &apos;m using the history of anatomy .
i &apos;m an historian , and in this case , i study how people relate to anatomy -- this is the human body , animal bodies -- how they went around with body fluids , with body sheets , as they thought about bodies .
the other hat that i used to do in my work is the activist , as a patient physicist -- or , as i say sometimes , as patients -- people who are patients &apos; patients .
in this case , i worked with people , the body guy , asking the social norms .
so , for example , i worked with people who are si@@ am@@ ese twins , two people in a body .
i &apos;ve been working with people with z@@ warf , so people who were smaller than usual .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with inter@@ sexual people whose gender at@@ yp@@ ic is -- people who are not the average male or female body types .
and in general , we can use the word of inter@@ sexuality .
inter@@ sexuality is in many different forms .
i &apos;m just going to give you a few examples of the kinds of sex types that don &apos;t cause the male or female standard .
in one case , you might have someone with a foreign chromosome base , and the s@@ ry of the y ch@@ om@@ o@@ som@@ s leaves the ribb@@ g that we &apos;ve all got to grow and grow .
and therefore , the te@@ te@@ te@@ te@@ te@@ te@@ ties give up testosterone .
but because this individual is missing the recept@@ ors to see testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to testosterone .
and this is called android receptor li@@ ct .
so a lot of testosterone , but not a reaction .
as a result , the body is evolving more the typical female course .
when the kid is born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s brought as a girl .
but it takes mostly until you get to puberty and grow your breasts and evolve , but you don &apos;t get your period , until somebody comes to it .
and you &apos;re making a few tests , and you find out that instead of eating ice and uter@@ o , in reality , she &apos;s wearing a y chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually hold that person for male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , in our bodies , have something called adrenal@@ in@@ top@@ sen .
they are in the back of our bodies .
and the side kid@@ neys represent andro@@ genes , which are vital hormones .
most of the women , like me -- i think to be a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my real chromosomes , but i think i &apos;ve probably got the typical one -- most women like me are actually talking about .
we produce andro@@ gs , and we &apos;re talking about andro@@ genes .
and the consequence is that somebody like me actually have a brain that was exposed to more adequate , as a woman who was born with te@@ stic@@ age , and an android receptor defe@@ ct .
so gender is really complicated , you &apos;re not only in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some sense , you can be distributed across the range .
another example : a few years ago , i received the call of a 19 year-old man , who was born as a boy , he had a friend , he had a friend , had sex with his girlfriend , lived with his girlfriend , and he had just figured out he had o@@ er@@ sticks and his uter@@ o .
he had a very extreme form of an innate foot jelly .
he &apos;s got x@@ x chromosome , and in uter@@ o , his side kid@@ neys were so active that they basically created a male hormone environment .
and as a result , his gen@@ colo@@ ine male , his brain was exposed to the sheer male of the hormone spectrum .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- no one had anything .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , in fact , because he was at the inside , the doctors found he was inside female .
okay , just a quick example of a variation of inter@@ sexuality .
some people with x@@ x chromosomes , something that is called o@@ staf@@ est@@ is , which is covered by ice tissues .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason why kids with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s grown or si@@ am@@ es@@ an twins , whether it &apos;s interesting -- from surgeons often to be adapted to the norm , isn &apos;t because that &apos;s for their physical health .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why they &apos;re often making different kinds of surgical intervention is because they threaten our social categories .
typically our system is based on the idea that there &apos;s a certain of anatom@@ ical views with a specific identity .
so we have the concept that one woman &apos;s a woman means to have a female identity ; a black person is supposed to be an african anatomy in terms of their own story .
so we have this terribly simplistic idea .
and if we &apos;re faced with a body , which is actually something very different for us , it makes us feel like this .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individu@@ alism .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individu@@ alism .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is when kids are born , the two people in a body .
where i was most excited about most of the exciting , the south of south america was ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya last year whose gender was asked at the lei@@ chat@@ dge shanghai champion@@ ship in berlin .
many journalists , many journalists , called me the question , &quot; which test will you do that tells us whether ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya is female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain to journalists that there was this test .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature is not pulling a line between male and female , or between male and the female and the female and it &apos;s responsible , it &apos;s responsible for us to think that the line of the line is .
so , we have a situation where , the further our science advances on , we have to deal with so much more , that these categories that we &apos;ve been able to be able to be able to create for advanced identity categories , which is very simple to create permanent current campaigns , which is much in@@ easy than we &apos;ve accepted .
and it &apos;s not just about gender .
it &apos;s also about race , which turns out to be more complicated than our termin@@ ology has approved .
in our games , we were in all kinds of uncomfortable areas .
so , for example , for example , the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what should we do with the fact that we &apos;re just different from a few nuclear o@@ unds ?
as we continue to move our science forward , we &apos;re increasingly moving into a zone of uncomfortable where we have to recognize that the simplistic categories we &apos;ve had is probably too simple .
we see this in all kinds of human life .
one of the areas where we see this in our culture today , in our culture today , in the united states , are the struggle on the beginning and the end of life .
we have difficult conversations about what point a body becomes to people , so he has another right to do than fet@@ als .
we have very difficult re@@ missions now -- perhaps not as public as medicine -- about the question when somebody is dead .
our ancestors had never been so hard to fight the question when somebody was dead .
you &apos;ve just been holding a fea@@ ther under the nose , and if you moved , you haven &apos;t buried it yet .
if you &apos;re no longer moved , you have buried it .
but today we are in a situation where we are taking people into life organs and want to feed other people .
and as a result , we start with the struggle with the really difficult question when somebody is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult position in which we don &apos;t have as simple categories as we used to .
now , you might think that the whole set of categories would make someone like me really happy .
i &apos;m politically progressive , i &apos;m inten@@ ding people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
to realize that these categories are really much less insecure than we thought , make me feel like that .
and it makes me feel like in terms of thinking about democracy .
so to tell you about this tension , i need to know first that i &apos;m a big fan of the founding fathers .
i know they were terrified , i know they were sex@@ antly , but they were great .
i think they were so brave and so radical , and so radical , in what they did , i &apos;m going to look at all of the years that i &apos;m going to look at it in 17@@ 76 , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happened 17@@ 76 with the founding fathers .
the founding fathers were from my view of the original anatom@@ ic activists , which is why .
what they came back was a anatom@@ ical concept , and they made it through another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
as you all remember , our founding fathers suggested the concept of mon@@ archy , and the mon@@ archy was based on a very simpli@@ fied concept of anatomy .
the most glorious of the old world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of the birth@@ on the right .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the idea that people , the political power , should have the political power , because of the wounded blood line from the grandfather to the son to the son and so on .
the founding fathers reveals this idea back , and they put it through a new anatom@@ ical concept , and this concept said that all people were created equal .
you see , ni@@ vel@@ d the play , and they decided that anatom@@ ically , the common ones , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now they made this part , because they were part of an educational system in which two things grew together .
democracy grew up , but at the same time also grew science .
if you look at the story of the founding fathers , it will clear that many of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of an natur@@ alistic world .
they went away from the point of explanations , and things like a super@@ natural concept of power , back where the transmission is based on a very smooth conception of birth .
they moved to an natur@@ alistic concept .
and for example , if you look at the independence of independence , you talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of that , they created a concept of anatom@@ ical common@@ alities .
and with that , they actually prepared the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think that way , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened then ?
for example , for example , women who were doing the vote right , the concept of the founding fathers , which says that anatom@@ ically more important is more important than the anatom@@ ical difference , and said , &quot; that we should have a reputation and an egg , &quot; that we should have a reputation and the law , &quot; etc . , etc . &quot;
and women were arguing about the successful .
next of all , the successful civil rights movement , where we were people , like so@@ yl@@ ner , who sp@@ s about it , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in march lines of the burden that say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , human skin color , which is based on anatom@@ ical areas of anatom@@ ic differences , again , successful .
we see the same thing about the disabled movement movement .
of course , the problem is that , as we start to look at all the similarities , we need to begin to question why we maintain certain di@@ visions .
well , sure , i would like to maintain certain di@@ ings , anatom@@ ically , in our culture .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give a fish to a fish like this .
i don &apos;t want to say we should take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that 5@@ year-olds should have the right to get to sex or to get married .
so there are some anatom@@ ical di@@ ings that make sense for me , and that &apos;s what we think i should keep .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep it , and whether they &apos;re meaningful .
so let &apos;s get back to these two creatures that have been mapped to the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in the middle 1979 , the same day .
let &apos;s imagine one of them , maria , three months ago , was born , so it was born on the one june of 1980 .
hein@@ rich , on the other hand , is born by the dawn of the age , so he was born at march march .
just because maria was born for three months , you get all kinds of three months ago , you get all kinds of three months ago -- to have the right sex , to choose the right to drink .
hein@@ rich has to wait for all of this , not because he &apos;s got another biological age only because of the time of his birth .
we find other experiments about what your rights are .
hein@@ rich , because you think he &apos;s male -- although i don &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s a storyteller -- because you think he &apos;s male , he can now be moved , which doesn &apos;t have to worry about it .
maria , however , cannot be able to see the same thing in all states , the hein@@ rich in all states , which is the right to marry .
hein@@ rich can marry a woman in every state , but maria can only marry a woman in a few states .
so we have these permanent anatom@@ ical categories that are in many ways of problematic and question@@ able .
and for me , the question is , what are we going to do , because our science is doing this process in the anatomy , that we have to reach a point where we have to admit that a democracy is based on anatomy ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time it feels like the science is self-@@ making itself .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture would take a kind of pragmatic posture , &quot; okay , we need to pull a line , so we &apos;ll pull it somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people will start in a very strange position .
so , for example , texas , at one point , decided to marry a man means that you don &apos;t have y chromosome , and to marry a woman means you have an y chromosome .
now in practice , people don &apos;t test on their chromosomes .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of the story that i was telling you about the end receptor receptor .
if we look at the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream of a dream . &quot;
he says we shouldn &apos;t be human skin color , but after the quality of their character , &quot; judge , &quot; and goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do this in practice ?
how do you evaluate people because of their personality properties ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should be in places like this to people , because i have to admit that i &apos;ve ever had a series of golden convention ever known for soci@@ ally than some people i know .
i want to suggest that i probably know some light labs of the dogs , the more powerful , more intelligent , more intelligent and making decisions about their sexual relationships than some of them i know .
so how should we confront the question of the character ?
it turns out it &apos;s really difficult .
and part of me , what if the content of a character would be something that would be in the future of the machine , could be made by an editor ?
do we really want to go into this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it &apos;s really important to think about the idea that the u.s. is involved in being concerned about democracy .
in our practice of democracy , we &apos;ve done our job really well , and i think we would do well in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , for example , in iran , for example , is where a guy who feels sexually to other men is being pun@@ ished with death , unless he &apos;s ready to go to an age of anesthesia in which case he could stay alive .
the conditions of these species exist with us .
i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have these conditions -- a surgeon that i was talking about a few years ago that had brought a few si@@ am@@ ese twins to separate them , to be part of a name .
but when i was talking to him , and i asked him why he made this procedure -- it was high-@@ risk surgery -- his answer was that in his country , that these kids would be very poor , and that &apos;s why he had to do it .
i would tell him , &quot; well , have you been able to think of political as@@ yl@@ eal rather than a surgery . &quot;
the united states provide incredible opportunities to allow people to be , without being able to change the state of the state .
so i think we need to be leaders .
all right , just to conclude , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibility of thinking about what democracy might be like , or looked at the mothers .
and i want to say something that &apos;s radical for a feminist thing , which is , i think , that there might be different kinds of insight that would be used by different kinds of anatomy , especially when people are doing a group thinking .
since years , because i was interested in inter@@ sexuality , i &apos;ve also been interested in the field of gender .
and one of the things that i really found interesting about is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and operate in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from culture studies is that women , on average -- not everybody , but on average -- more complex social relationships and care for people that are vulnerable to the group that are vulnerable to the group .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
years ago , when i was making a graduate student , i asked one of my graduate students , who knew my interest in femin@@ ism -- i looked at me as a feminist , it &apos;s a really personal question .
he said , &quot; tell me what the femin@@ ism is female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the most stupid question i &apos;ve ever heard .
femin@@ ism is about solving the stereotypes about gender , so femin@@ ism is not female .
but the more i thought about his question , so much more i thought there might be something female in femin@@ ism .
it &apos;s supposed to be , it could give something , it could be in average , in the average of male brains of male , which makes us feel more effective for highly complex social relationships , and it &apos;s more effective to worry about the protection .
so , where the founding fathers were extremely reflective to figure out how individuals could be protected in the state , it &apos;s possible that when we get more mothers into this concept , we have more a concept , not just how to protect , not just how to avoid , but how we can be concerned for each other .
and perhaps it &apos;s where we have to go to the future , if we take democracy out of anatomy -- less about the individual body thinking about identity , and thinking more about relationships .
so , as people try to make a perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m j@@ ess@@ i , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i &apos;m doing in it , i &apos;m going to make a very public conf@@ ession , and this is , i &apos;m obsessed with out@@ fits .
i love every opportunity to find a different colorful , stupid out@@ fit , to wear , and in the last time , too , too .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes from the second hand to fle@@ ck markets , and in contamin@@ ators .
ooh , thank you .
contamin@@ ation shopping allows me to reduce the impact of my garage to the environment , and also to the power exchange .
i meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars used to serve for a good purpose ; i look quite unique , and it &apos;s going shopping to my personal personal search .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it have my height ?
am i going to like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers , i feel , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and i &apos;ll tell you what i &apos;ve been doing here at ted .
i mean , what do someone do with so many out@@ fits ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven some sub@@ pants , and that &apos;s all .
a week for exactly a week , everything i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i made sure that i would have everything i might want to wear , would find if i first came to palm springs .
and since you &apos;re not heard of me as the woman running around at ted in her underwear , that &apos;s what i found a few things .
and i really want to show you my out@@ fits for this week .
sounds good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m also going to give you some of the lessons that i &apos;m doing , whether you believe it or not , have learned nothing new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the bright tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost look very great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole out@@ fit , including the jacket took me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece i carried in this week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost impossible to be worse , if you &apos;re wearing bright red pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you make other happy people .
tuesday : adaptation is completely over@@ rated .
i spent a lot of time in my life doing it , trying to be myself and adapt to me simultaneously .
be just who you are .
if you surrounded with the right people , you &apos;re not just going to understand it , you will appreciate it .
we@@ dn@@ ch : embrace your inner child .
sometimes i would say people , i would look like i &apos;m playing the games , or that i remember her seven@@ -year-old .
i &apos;ll smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thur@@ day : confidence is the key .
if you think it &apos;s fine , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think they don &apos;t look well , they &apos;re probably right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only when i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to summarize this for you .
if you believe they &apos;re inside and outside a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can do .
so there &apos;s no excuse for anyone in this audience .
we should be able to pin@@ ch everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden pa@@ il@@ le@@ tes to everything .
and finally , saturday : a very unique , unique way of making personal style , is a great way to tell the world about one , without having to say .
it &apos;s been proven , and again , when people started to get people to me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously , this will not fit everything in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to give you all again .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn that week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t have to make these things emotional , because the corner is always going to give it a different kind of crazy , colorful , shining , soft out@@ fit that &apos;s just waiting for me if i have a bit in love with it .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , everybody .
i &apos;ve got something i &apos;d like to show you .
think of this as a picture , flying .
this is what we call our lab , perceptual design .
let me tell you a little bit about this .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy in italy is growing up with this picture in his room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is something that was very interesting in the last decade .
so some time , if you wanted to win a formula , then you took your budget and put your money on a good driver and a good car .
and when the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
now , what you need now is , if you want to win a race , it &apos;s actually something like this -- something that happens in real time , a few thousand sensors , have a couple of thousand sensors , the information from the car , and then they use it , and then they use it in real time to send things back in time .
this would call them in engineering teams , call a real-time control system .
and basically , it &apos;s a system which is made out of two parts -- a close part and an explanation .
what &apos;s interesting now is the real-time control systems start in our lives .
our cities , in the last few years , were equipped with networks and electronics .
you &apos;re going to get into computers .
and as a computer , you start to respond to different ways , you &apos;re being seen and driven .
when we move cities , it &apos;s actually a big deal .
just by the way , i want to say that cities are only two percent of the earth , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population live there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of energy consumption -- to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so , if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big deal .
in addition to cities , all of this perceive and drive into objects of everyday life .
this is from an exhibition , the pa@@ ola ant@@ on@@ elli for moma later in the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; me with me . &quot;
now , all our objects , our environment , start talking to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like every atom is going to be out there , a sensor and a transducer .
and this changes the interaction that we have people out of our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michel@@ angel@@ o ...
you know , when michel@@ angel@@ o shaped the moses , it means he took the hammer at the end of moses , and he threw it on moses -- in fact , you can still see a small spot , and said , &quot; ge@@ ch@@ é ja@@ par@@ li ? why don &apos;t you say ? &quot;
now , today , our environment begins for the first time to answer us .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea to perceive and perceive our environment .
let &apos;s start with the insight .
now the first project i want to show you is actually one of the first of our labs .
it came in italy four weeks ago .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually using a new kind of network that was used in the whole world -- this is a mobile phone web -- and it &apos;s anonymous and un@@ inhabited information from the network that will be collected by the gate to understand how the city works .
summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was the foot@@ -@@ waiting world champion@@ ship .
some of you will remember , it was in italy in italy , and then at the end of the end , the head beat .
and anyway , italy won in the end .
now look at what happened in this day , just watching the activity that &apos;s going on in the network .
this is the city .
you can see in the middle of the giant , the airplane .
in the morning , the game .
you see the timeline .
in the afternoon , people here , and the calls are moving .
the game starts -- silence .
france makes a gateway . italy makes a gateway .
thir@@ ty times , people make a short call , go to toilet .
second time . end of the normal play time .
first extension , second .
quot@@ ed , in a moment of the head .
italy wins . yeah .
now , at this night , everybody went to celebration .
they saw the big yield .
the next day , everybody went to the center to meet the tennis team and prime minister at the same time .
and then everybody went down .
you see the picture of the place about cir@@ co mas@@ sim@@ o , where , since the roman time , people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the out@@ breaks at the end of the day .
now , this is just an example of how we can feel the city today in a way we couldn &apos;t .
again , another example of feeling : this is not about people , it &apos;s about things we use and consume .
now , now we know everything about where we are .
this is a map that shows you all the chips , which is a mac computer , as they came together .
but we know very little about where things go .
so , in this project , we actually designed some little markers to track the garbage while it goes through the system .
so we started with a couple of volunteers that we have , a little more than a year ago , in seattle , to highlight the things that they threw away -- different kinds of things you can see -- things that you would be able to throw away anyway .
and then we have the little chips , the small brands , on the garbage , and we started tracking it .
here are the results we &apos;ve just gotten .
seattle ...
after a week .
with this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of in@@ efficiency in the system .
we can do the same things in which we do less energy .
the data was not available before .
but that &apos;s a lot of un@@ useful transportation and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day , that the cup that we throw away is not simply that it &apos;s still on the planet somewhere .
and the plastic bottle we still throw away every day .
and if we show this people , then we can move a behavior change .
so this is the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , as@@ sa@@ f beer , could tell you a lot more about the perceive , and the many other wonderful things that you can do with perceive , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part that we talked about , and that &apos;s the norm of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in zar@@ a@@ go@@ za , spain .
it started with a question of the citizen values that came to us and said that spain and southern europe have a beautiful tradition to use water in public places as part of the architecture .
and the question was , how could you connect technology to connect new technology ?
and one of the ideas that had been introduced in a workforce was , you know , these little mammals , and valves , magnetic valves , valves that open and close .
they &apos;re going to do something like a water@@ bias with images of water .
if these images fall down , you can write on it , you can display patterns , images , text .
and you can approach him , and it will open up to let them skip , as you can see in this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor of bel@@ ine .
it was very like him .
and we got the mission to design a building on the entrance of the expo .
we called it the digital water pa@@ vi@@ lli@@ on .
the whole building was water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but if you approach it , it will open and bring it into it .
the roof was also covered with water .
and if it &apos;s win@@ ding , if you want to reduce the injection , you can even let the roof down .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture will be , you know , this day , you know , when you drive down the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve broken the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t break the building , it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappears .
here &apos;s how the building works .
you see the person wondering what &apos;s going on inside .
and this is me , when i was trying to test the number of sensors that opened the water , not getting wet .
now , i should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors were listening .
but in this night , it was a bigger one .
all the kids from zar@@ a@@ go@@ za came to the building , because the way they were playing with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open up to make them open , but a building that had still breaks and holes in water , you had to jump now without getting wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we think about how people use things that we design .
but reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are used and interact with people .
now , here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical images , the images of water and the projections on it .
and this is what made us think about the project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine if you can really start to fly .
imagine , you could have little helicop@@ ters flying through the air , and each of you with a little image of it -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like the one you &apos;ve seen before , that moves with others , completely synchr@@ eness .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or un@@ regular but in three dimensions , which is what changes , the light is not the position of images .
you can play with different kinds of species .
if you look at the screen , it could just appear in different formats or sizes , in different solutions .
but then it could be just a 3d cloud from images that you can go to , and that you can move through and move through many , many directions .
this is a real fl@@ y@@ matic controller , which is turning down to shape as you did before .
if you turn on the light , it looks like this . so , as we saw it before .
imagine that every single one of people will be run .
it could have a momentum every single dot that comes from people from the movements of humans or something .
i want to show you something first here .
we worked with robert to bol@@ le , one of the best ballet dancers of our time -- the é@@ id on the metropolitan theater in new york , and the sc@@ ala in ma@@ an -- we took his movement in 3d to use it as a impulse for the fl@@ y@@ fire .
this is robert to dancing .
on the left-hand side , you see the imagery , the various different experiences .
it &apos;s a real-time 3d scan at the same time .
so you can feel the movement .
you can do this all the time .
but then , once we have all the images , you can play with it and play with color movement and string movement .
we want to use that as a possible impulse for the fl@@ y@@ fire .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re doing for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
so , again , the idea is , imagine what we &apos;re doing again to do with the people to do something and change the environment -- almost something like we call it , to build motion movement , as you can move , but with a cloud .
imagine you can give a little donation for an image .
i think that the remarkable one of the last year , the last decades , is that we &apos;ve changed from a physical to a digital world .
this has digitized everything , knowledge , and it makes it available through the internet .
now , for the first time , we can do that for the first time -- and the campaign wa@@ am@@ as has shown this -- we can get from the digital world , from the self-organizing forces of the networks to the physical world .
it can be , in our case , that we use it to design and to create a symbol .
that &apos;s something built in the city .
but tomorrow , to give us the following challenges -- think about climate change , or co2 emissions -- how do we move from the digital world to the physical .
so the idea is that we actually engage the people where they do things together , collective .
the cloud is again a cloud of images , in the same way the real cloud is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of images .
it &apos;s a physical form in london , but it &apos;s covered with images .
they can move and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from below , the most important moments for olymp@@ ia 2012 and darfur , and using it as a kind of connection to community .
so , both the physical cloud in the sky , and something at its top , you can go and go like a new mountain summit .
you can go inside .
and a kind of digital lay@@ ch@@ tower on the night -- but the most important thing , a new kind of experience for everybody who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , the connection is very important to me .
through my work , i try to express that people are not separated from nature and that everything is connected .
the first time i was about 10 years ago in antarctica , where i saw my first ice mountains .
i made awe .
my heart ra@@ pe , i was angry , while i was trying to figure out what was going on .
the ice mountains around me took 60 feet from the water , and i could just wonder that this was a snow@@ fla@@ ke on another snow@@ ball , year after year .
ice mountains are born as cal@@ b of a glacier or by breaking it out of ice cream .
every ice mountain has its own individual personality .
they interact in explicit ways with their environment and their experiences .
some soft people will give up and bra@@ b down to the bitter end , whereas others don &apos;t get it , and in a certain standard passion .
if you look at a iceberg , you think they &apos;re isolated , separated and alone as we humans see ourselves .
but the truth is far away .
and as a ice shelf mel@@ ts , i have his pre-@@ current atmosphere .
in the ice ice , it puts mineral drinking water , which is a lot of life forms .
i &apos;m going to go to my images of these ice mountains , as if i was to make portraits of my ancestors , in the mind that in these individual eyes , they exist from this way , and never will exist again .
it &apos;s not a death if you melt down ; it &apos;s not an end , but it &apos;s a continuing of your circumstance on the cycle of life .
it &apos;s a part of the ice in the ice mountains that i &apos;m very young about -- a few thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you is a iceberg that i have in ke@@ ker@@ t@@ su@@ at@@ ak in greenland .
it &apos;s very rare you &apos;re actually witn@@ essing a rolling iceberg .
here it is .
on the left , you see a little boat .
it &apos;s about five feet long .
please look at the form of the iceberg , and where it &apos;s in the water line .
you can see here , he starts to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man stands there .
this is the average size of an greenland iceberg .
it took about 120 feet from the water , or 40 feet .
and this video is in real time .
and just like this , the ice mountain shows you a different side of its personality .
thank you .
my life is really extraordinary by doing some amazing projects .
but the cool@@ est thing i &apos;ve ever worked on was this guy .
his name is shocked .
sutherland was one of the leading graffiti artists of the 1980s .
then , one day , he came back from walking and said , &quot; pa@@ ps , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the act .
temple is fully paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i stood against him .
i have a company that makes design and animations , so graffiti is inevitably a complex part of what we admire in the art world .
so we decided , tony -- temple -- and to support his thing .
i met with his father and his brother , and i said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what do you do with it ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
i just want to go back with him , and i said , &quot; wait , is this not -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all communicate people through these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you &apos;ve heard about the higher life layer , you can really do this .
normal people aren &apos;t available to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
did anybody see the film &quot; butter@@ ling and deaf bell . &quot;
that &apos;s how they communicate -- they &apos;re running along .
i said , &quot; very arch@@ a@@ ic , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need to get just a check , and instead i made a check , which i was supposed to be able to solve .
i commit to the place , and i &apos;m going to get to his brother and his father , with the words , &quot; well , my proposal is : tony &apos;s going to speak , and we &apos;ll get him a machine , and we &apos;ll find a way that he can get his art again .
because it &apos;s an far@@ ce that anyone who &apos;s still wearing it can &apos;t communicate . &quot;
so i spoke a few months later at a conference .
i met these people from gr@@ l , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to put a light on any surface , and then to draw a laser poin@@ ter to drawing the negative .
so they pull around and they make art installations like this .
they say all the things that are shown up there is a life cycle .
it starts with the v@@ al@@ hip , then the cra@@ ppy words , then the indus script , and finally , people are doing art .
but there was always a life cycle in your presentation .
so , i went home and i went home with my wife , and i would tell her , &quot; well , second , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use your eyes to control things , you know , we should find a way to steer a laser , so that it could be a way to do a laser . &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a year , after a lot of organization and lots of things , we &apos;ve done some things .
one , we &apos;ve passed the insurance doors to the doors , and actually have a device to get a machine to communicate -- a stephen haw@@ k@@ y machine .
that was incredible .
and it &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him yo@@ da , because you talk to him , or you get an email , and i &apos;m like , &quot; i &apos;m so unpredictable , this guy &apos;s incredible . &quot;
and also , we had seven programmers all over the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to home .
my wife , my kids , and i moved into garage , and those hackers and programmers and the conspiracy and the conspiracy , and then re@@ pher@@ ed our house .
many of our friends thought we were beautiful to do that , and we went back and we went back all the images on the walls .
but for over two weeks , we were programmed , we went to the beach road in venice , my kids were involved , and my dog , and we created this .
it &apos;s called eye@@ writer , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap sun@@ glasses that we bought on the beaches of venice , some copper wire and a few things from the building market and the electric trade .
we took a double camera , they put them apart , they put it on a le@@ d light , and now we have a device that &apos;s available to -- you can build it itself , we put the code for free , the software can download free .
so we &apos;ve created a device which is completely freely free .
no insurance can make up .
no hospital .
every paralyzed can actually communicate with his eyes alone with his eyes .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of two weeks , we went back to the temple room .
i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room of somebody else , and that &apos;s his room .
now , there &apos;s all this happening in front of the great unvei@@ ling .
and then , after a year of planning , two weeks of programming work , nu@@ od@@ parties and running , tony took over for the first time after seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and it looks beyond his life support system .
we used his bed in order to look outside .
we put a proje@@ ctor against a wall of the park in front of the hospital .
and he drew again for the first time , he &apos;s in his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what was in the parking parking lot .
in fact , we also had to break into the parking parking lot , so we felt as a part of flooding .
at the end of the sand , he gave us an email with the answer , &quot; for the first time , i &apos;ve drawn something .
i feel that i was pun@@ ged underwater , and finally , someone pulled down and pulled my head up , so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
this is something like our scream .
that &apos;s what keeps us in the pole , and we continue to move forward .
and we need to make a lot more on this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a magic panel .
and someone who has such artistic potential deserves so much more .
so we &apos;re trying to figure out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
since that time , we &apos;ve got all kinds of recognition .
we won some prizes .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us made it .
it all comes from our own pockets .
so the drawings were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong twitter@@ ed over us and then , in december , the time magazine was honored , as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really great .
the cool@@ est part of it is -- and that includes the whole circle -- that it &apos;s april this april in the middle of los angeles in the middle of los angeles , &quot; art of the streets . &quot;
and i think that &apos;s pretty much the hardest practition@@ ers of the road art scene sitting there -- bank@@ sy , she@@ par@@ d britan@@ rey , ca@@ ws -- all these guys will be there .
temple is going to be part of the show , which is pretty dis@@ driving .
so , basically , if you look at something that &apos;s impossible , then you can do it .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the eye@@ writer -- everything was impossible at some point .
make it possible -- you all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i &apos;ve never had anything to do with au@@ dom@@ al technology , but i &apos;ve just taken something and surrounded me with amazing people so that we could put something on the legs .
and that question should be , every single day , every single day , to give you something that needs to be done . if not now , when ? and if not me , who ?
thank you .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most popular children &apos;s book writer .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to come like a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or leather , but nobody ever voted a farmer .
today , i want to tell you about circles and prejudice .
well , an epiphany is usually something that you find , because you &apos;ve dropped it somewhere .
you go around the block , and you take it as a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard lind@@ ing@@ tte .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle i want to share with you today .
my circle started in the 1960s at the high school in sto@@ w , ohio , where i was in the classrooms .
i was the one who was beaten in the ma@@ bs every week in the ma@@ bs and blue , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by using me the toilet in the teacher &apos;s room .
that was what she did .
it did it for three years .
and i needed to go out of the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it hit me to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and then , in the &apos; 80s , i found it in the &apos; 80s a work of aids organizations .
about three or four years ago , i was sitting in the middle of the night a call from this teacher , who said , &quot; i have to see them .
i &apos;m sad that we never know each other as adults .
can you please come to ohio , and please come together with the guy that i know you &apos;ve found in now .
and i should say , i &apos;ve got to say that i have a buil@@ va , and i want you to go . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughed , we were laughing , and we knew they must be in a hospi@@ ce .
we found one for them , we brought them down , and we got it around , and we gave them eight , and we gave them eight , because it was necessary .
it was something we knew .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as adults who wanted to know me , she turned it into a box full , and was laid into my hands .
what was happening was that the circle had closed , it had become a circle -- and the revelation i was talking about .
the revelation is that death is a part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything the rest of life needs .
it takes truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this has been mentioned today .
he needs the same -- he would need , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s to give us these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion as it comes up to 1,000 feet .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
imagine an engine , the blade , cu@@ ack , cu@@ ack , cu@@ ack , cu@@ ack , cu@@ ack , cu@@ ack .
that sounds frightening .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i sat down .
i was the only one who could talk to the airport .
so i looked at her , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve got a few birds . &quot;
the pilot had moved the machine already , and we weren &apos;t so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened simultaneously .
the pilot made the machine after the hudson river .
it &apos;s usually not the route .
he turns off the engines .
imagine a sound plane .
and then he said three words -- the most dangerous words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; let &apos;s do it . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the rest of the gun .
i was able to see it in her eyes , and i was tired of the life .
i want to share with you three things that i learned about this day .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
we have this living plan , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to make a hand and i didn &apos;t do it , all the f@@ ences that i wanted to roll , all the experiences i wanted to make and never made .
as i later thought about it , i thought , &quot; i collect bad w@@ bs . &quot;
because if the wine is the same , and the person is there , i open it .
i don &apos;t want to move anything in life .
and that urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and that was when we failed the george washington bridge , so pretty much about hair -- i thought , man , there is one thing i really regret .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity and with my mistakes , i would suggest to be better in everything i was doing .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve also given my ego space .
and i took the time that i wasted meaningful things wasted tea , people that means something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people .
and after i thought about it , i decided to put negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i did not eliminate me two years with my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have more , right . i make me feel happy .
the third thing i learned -- and while the inner clock is beginning , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , 13 . &quot;
you see the water coming .
i said , &quot; please flying into the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 pieces , how you know it from a documentary .
as we fall off , i had this feeling , man , to die .
almost like we &apos;re going to prepare our lives for it .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sadness really ended up in a thought , which is that i just have a wish .
i just wish i could see my kids growing up .
about a month after this , i went to visit my daughter -- first graders , not much artistic talent .
not yet .
and i promise , i &apos;m a little kid .
and in the world , everything gave sense to me .
i realized then , by connecting the dots , it was only about being a great parent .
more than everything , everything else is my only goal to be a good parent .
i became the wonder to die on this day .
i got another gift , which is to see the future and come back and to live .
my call to everybody who flies today , is imagine the same thing going on on your flight -- don &apos;t please -- but do you think , and how would you change ?
what would they do that they &apos;re doing , because they think they &apos;re still there ?
how would they change their relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything , are you the best parents that you can just be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the stu@@ x@@ net computer worm is pretty straightforward .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important post for the development of nuclear weapons is the dominant ultrasound facility in nato .
the gray boxes that you see here are real-time control systems .
now , if you &apos;re going to be able to do the systems that controls and valves figures and valves control , then we can actually do a lot of problems with the centri@@ fuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t walk with win@@ king software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we make it that an effective wave virus is being used on a laptop that &apos;s used by a bank engineer to con@@ compass this gray box , we &apos;re in business .
and this is the planning behind stu@@ x@@ net .
so we start with a scanning drone .
the use of the data will be put in the gray box , damaged the centri@@ fuge , and the iranian power program delay -- publishing mission .
this is a child &apos;s game , right ?
i want to tell you how we &apos;ve figured this out .
when we started our research at stu@@ x@@ net six months ago , completely unknown , which was the point and purpose of this engineer .
the only thing that we knew is very , very complicated , which is in terms of the skin of the skin , the drone -- he made it by thousands of sp@@ o@@ o@@ o@@ os .
and it seemed to have something to do with these gray boxes , this real-time -- control systems .
that made our attention , and we started a lab project where we were infected our environment with stu@@ x@@ net , and we studied this construct .
and then something weird happened .
stu@@ x@@ net , like a laboratory rat , who didn &apos;t like our cheese -- she got off , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
and after we were experimenting with various kinds of cheese , i decided that this was a targeted attack .
it was completely on a particular destination .
the drone is actively active on the gray box , when a special configuration was discovered , even if the special program , which is trying to capture it on this goal .
and if stu@@ x@@ net doesn &apos;t do anything .
so , that &apos;s really my interest , and we started working with it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it might , for example , say , an american power power , or a chemical plant in germany .
so we should soon figure out what the goal is .
so extract and de@@ comp@@ d , we found the attacks code , and we found that he &apos;s re@@ structured into two digital war@@ heads -- a smaller and bigger .
and we also realized that they were very profession@@ ally constructed by people who obviously gave all the information .
they knew all pieces and by@@ by@@ sets they had to attack .
you might even know the shoe size of the machine .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve learned that the drone of stu@@ x@@ net complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the use of data is a science for itself .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this race code .
we &apos;re talking here from -- about 15,000 lines of code .
it looks pretty much like old-fashioned tips .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart from this code .
so what we were looking for first was systems function , because we know what that does .
and then we were looking for ti@@ bers and data structures , trying to bring them to the real world -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could give or dis@@ count .
in order to think about these theories , we &apos;re going to remind ourselves that it &apos;s definitely high-@@ level sab@@ ot@@ age , it &apos;s got to be a high-@@ quality destination , and it &apos;s very likely to be iran , because that &apos;s where most infections were made .
now , there &apos;s not several thousand goals in this area .
it &apos;s basically walking to the bu@@ check nuclear power power , and it &apos;s in vi@@ gue .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; send me a list of all the experts for real-time and power works from our client . &quot;
and i called them up , and i had their knowledge to compare their expertise to compare what we discovered in the code and the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to get the little digital war@@ head with the pink controls .
the ro@@ gate is this moving part within the centri@@ fuge , this black object that you see .
and if you manipulated the speed of this rotating , then you &apos;re actually able to crack the ro@@ gate , and eventually , you can get the centri@@ fuge apart .
and what we &apos;ve also found is that the goal of the attack actually was to allow it to happen and make it easy to happen -- obviously , in the trial that you can &apos;t be able to get it quickly .
the big digital war@@ head -- we got a glimpse of it by looking at very precisely data and data structures .
so , for example , the number 16@@ 4 scales out of this code , you can &apos;t miss it .
i began to work on the scientific literature , about how this race is built in nato and found that they are structured in so-called cas@@ ca@@ ds , and every cas@@ ca@@ de contains 16@@ 4 .
so that made sense , put it together .
and it got better .
this centered in iran is distributed into the ground of 15 .
and guess what we found in the attacks code ?
it &apos;s almost identical structure .
so again , that &apos;s really fine .
and this gave us great confidence for what we studied here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that wasn &apos;t easy .
these results have been done by a couple of weeks of work .
and we often ran into a dead gas and we had to collect .
but anyway , we found that both digital war@@ heads are actually in one and the same objective , but from different directions .
the little war@@ ber takes over a cas@@ ka@@ de , and the ro@@ ckers and slowed it down and down , and the big war@@ head starts with six cas@@ ca@@ ds in interaction and alliance .
so , in big and large , we &apos;re very hopeful that we actually have what the goal is .
it &apos;s natasha and it &apos;s just natasha .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be hit by stu@@ x@@ net .
this is something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- it &apos;s really made me out of sound .
down there is the gray box , and on top of them , you see the centered box .
now , what &apos;s causing this thing is that it comes to the rising values of sensors -- so , for example , the printing sensors and vibra@@ tional sensors -- and it provides legiti@@ orized code , which is still during attack , running with false data .
and in fact , this false data data is done before .
so , it &apos;s just like in hollywood movies , where the search hunt is being fed by the case of the observation , and it &apos;s been fed by the latest video video .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
the idea , obviously , is not just the machine machine in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more aggressive .
the idea is to over@@ list a digital safety system .
we need digital security systems where a human machine can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so , in a power plant , for example , if the big steam tur@@ bine becomes too fast , you have to open sprawl within milliseconds .
of course , this cannot be done by a human machine leaders .
so at this point , we need digital security systems .
and if those are at risk , really bad things can happen .
the power can explode .
and not the machine leaders , the safety system will notice it .
this is frightening .
but it gets worse .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
think about it . this attack is generic .
it doesn &apos;t have anything special to do with it , with uranium .
so , for example , he would work so well -- in a power power or in a car factory .
it &apos;s generic .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attac@@ der -- you don &apos;t have to get the use of the data on a us@@ ar stick , as we saw at stu@@ x@@ net .
you could also use common worm technology .
you just have to spread it as well as possible .
and if you do that , eventually you get a cyber@@ weapon of mass destruction .
that &apos;s the implication we have to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the richest environments .
we need to make the consequences , and we &apos;re getting better at ourselves .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it was reported a lot of the time that people think that the moses was the main organization behind it .
is it also yours ?
okay , you really want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
my opinion is , in my opinion , it &apos;s not israel .
so the driving force is the cyber power .
it &apos;s only one , and that &apos;s the united states -- luckily , happiness .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for taking care of a fear . thanks ralph .
i &apos;ve spent the last couple of years to place in situations that usually are very difficult and at the same time .
i went to jail -- hard .
i worked in a coal mining -- dangerous .
i was filmed in war areas -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days of doing nothing than this to food -- running at the beginning , a little difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i &apos;ve been exposed to the most terrifying part of my career , and it &apos;s all about trying to figure out what &apos;s going on for trying to study social bel@@ ang , which is what they &apos;re doing , and hopefully , in a way , to understand what they do for the audience .
so when i knew i was going to come here in a tedtalk to look at the world of brand@@ ing and spon@@ ting , i knew i would make something slightly different .
some of you may have heard that i &apos;ve turned a display on ebay a few weeks ago .
i sent a couple of facebook messages , some twitter news , and i gave people the opportunity to be nam@@ ed on my tedtalk in 2011 .
in fact , some happy people and companies , durable profit and standards , the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let it go -- that i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let it go to the talk , which you just see , who had no title at the time .
so what you got was , you know , this : your name : my tedtalk , from which you don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be the subject , and that would end up with the content for the ears to fly , especially if i have your company for your participation .
but from it , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people see these tedtalks ?
a lot .
this is just the process of labor .
so despite that warning , i knew anyone would buy the name .
now , if you asked me this a year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you this with certainty .
but in the new project i work , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the advertising .
as i said , i &apos;ve been moving over the years in some pretty horrible situations , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could help me to go to anything so difficult and as dangerous as to go to this guy .
you know , i had the idea for a film .
what i would like to do is , you know , a film around the product of the puzzle , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by scaffolding , marketing and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the serial triumph ever . &quot;
so what &apos;s going on in &quot; the serial explosion ever happens , &quot; is that everything , from the top up to the end , is covered completely with brands -- from the cover , which you see in the film , that &apos;s the brand .
now this brand , the quality of pain , the static center ...
these people will be connected to the film in infinity forever .
and so the film is going to study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ?
i &apos;m a redund@@ ant person .
that was more accurate .
it was &quot; in infinity , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not only going to run the brand x as a title , but we will make sure we &apos;re going to sell every single category in the film .
so perhaps we sell a shoe , and he &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe you ever wore ...
the greatest car that you &apos;re ever going to have , from &quot; the placebo triumph ever , &quot; the greatest drink that you &apos;ve ever had , an awareness of &quot; the placebo explosion ever . &quot;
so the idea is , besides showing that brands are part of life , actually , to bring it to the film ?
and we &apos;re actually showing the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the film of phosphorus .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from the beginning to end .
and i would enjoy , if ce@@ g would help do this .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how smart people will be .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; points , &quot; because that has a negative framework -- but you know how this is going to evolve ?
how much money is needed to determine that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet it , but i think it &apos;s worth it on any case to talk about some really known brands .
who knows when the film comes out , we might see a little bit like a hor@@ li@@ zer .
what do you think the answer will be ?
the answer is probably being said &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing for the film or a difficult thing for me ?
j@@ k : both .
so , not so optimistic .
so , my lord , you can help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands are .
yeah .
if you look at the people you have to do with it .
there are some places we can turn to .
imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera &quot; would mean we wanted to do a background conversation .
it turned out it was really , &quot; we want to do nothing with your film . &quot;
and all those companies disappeared , one after the other .
nothing wanted to do with the film .
i was amazed .
they wanted nothing to do with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of advertising , was to present your product as many people as possible , as many people can see .
especially in the world today , at this point of new and old media , and the broken media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting process that the masses brings that message .
no , that was what i thought .
but you see , the problem was that my idea had a fatal mistake , and that was the following .
actually , no , that was not the mistake at all .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture represents is a problem .
see , if you put transparency in the google search , it &apos;s one of the first images that appears .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- free from deception and cro@@ ck , just to explore and look through , just recognize , characterized by expression and access to information , especially , which is the most important line .
you know , we &apos;re currently listening a lot about transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ceos say it .
but if it &apos;s going to happen , it will change anything .
but why ? well , transparency is scary -- like this strange bear , who still counts .
it &apos;s in@@ predictable -- like this strange land .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is otherwise ?
a whole bowl of cool food .
it &apos;s very risky .
so when i started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell that story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
you see , when i was a kid , and my father kept me on lying -- and he &apos;s sitting there , and he &apos;s looking at me -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions .
you have your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so , you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
but there was only one company that was willing to help us -- and this is also because i &apos;ve known john bond and richard church &apos;s tree since years -- i realized that i had to do it alone , and i had to go around the middle to the companies .
so what you all suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that when you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , is a wider problem .
i have friends who make great , massive hollywood films , and i have friends , the little supernova movies as i do .
and my friends , the great , massive hollywood movies , say that the reason why your films are so successful is to be in the brand concert that you have .
and then my friends , who are making little supernova films , &quot; well , how do we compete with these big , gigantic hollywood films ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the serial triumph ever . &quot;
so how are we going to see ban in the film ?
whenever i get to the path , and whenever i open the medical closet , they will see ban de@@ dor@@ ant .
and every time i got somebody interview , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you so far ? you look a little nervous .
i want to help you calm up .
so , maybe you should be a little bit on this interview . &quot;
and then we put one of these great du@@ ks .
&quot; fl@@ do@@ do@@ ity &quot; or &quot; paradise wind , &quot; you &apos;ll have choice .
we &apos;re going to be equipped both for men and for women -- solid , wheel@@ on , or a stick , whatever .
this is the short so@@ cket .
now , i can answer all of your questions and give you a re@@ version .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you talk about the smaller films , we &apos;re a problem as a brand .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so things like that -- you know , people remember ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we are interested .
what would you like to describe ban ?
ban is tivo .
this is a great question .
excess technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something that someone is doing under the eighth .
we &apos;re talking about bold , fresh .
i think &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word , that this category really does something positive , as opposed to &quot; fighting smell and moisture . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep it fresh longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three inches .
these things have a more positive effect .
and this is a million company .
what about me ? what about the prints ?
i have to talk to the guy in the street that are like me , ot@@ to-@@ normal consumers .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like nice clothes .
australia : visiting revi@@ val on sk@@ ess@@ t , except on greenland .
okay , what is the brand ?
unique .
i think the gen@@ re , the style i have , is probably &quot; dark glamour . &quot;
i like many black colors , lots of gray notes and such stuff .
but i normally have a access@@ ing , like sun@@ glasses , or a jewelry and a stuff .
when dan would be a brand , he would probably be a classic mer@@ ce@@ ce@@ of the cab@@ rio .
man 2 : the brand that i &apos;m , i would say , is conductive fly .
woman 2 : part hippie , part yo@@ gi , part of brooklyn girl -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the sweet guy .
i sell in the whole country around the country .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i was more mature .
man 5 : brand failed alcohol hol@@ ter in writing .
is this ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a pilot .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be the blue token , but i &apos;m often looking at the interface of the dark glamour and entertaining fly .
and what was realized was that i needed an expert .
i needed somebody who could get into my mind , somebody who could really help me understand what is called &quot; the brand &quot; sign . &quot;
and so i found a company called ol@@ son z@@ el@@ man in pittsburgh burg .
they &apos;ve helped companies like ne@@ agle , fe@@ bre@@ ts , hall@@ mark , to discover this calculation .
if you could do it , you could help me .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
that &apos;s me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how this is connected to your thoughts and feelings about it .
these are the people who form my world &apos;s brain .
tell me about this world .
m@@ d : the world , i think , the world is the world where people are around , the friends , the family , the family , the way you live lives , the work and so forth .
all of these things emerge and start from a place , and for me , and start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next one you want to talk about .
the next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what context is this to the thought and emotions about them ?
it &apos;s like i want to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are que@@ tile . i like curious things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; -- what does it bring us ?
what &apos;s the ma@@ che@@ te ? what puppet are they currently ?
why is it important to start new ? what does the red represents ?
tell me a little bit about this piece .
a bit more about you , you &apos;re not .
what other metals have they gone through ?
that doesn &apos;t have to be fear . what kind of roll@@ ter@@ aster are they ?
ee : no , thank you .
thank you very much .
yeah . well . okay .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be done .
there was a lot of crazy things going on .
the first one , what i saw was this idea that your brand personality is two separate , but the end pages -- the morgan , the morgan , the morgan , is an eight-@@ legged bill .
it &apos;s very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
and i think some companies will just focus on a strength , rather than both .
many companies tend to -- and this is the human nature -- to avoid things that you &apos;re not sure , you &apos;re afraid , you &apos;re afraid , these elements , and you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to get it to yourself , and it &apos;s a lay@@ ered chess suit .
what other brands are doing ?
the first one is a classic , apple .
and you can see it here , attitude , wi@@ i , mini of mini co@@ op@@ ers and jet blue .
well , there &apos;s actually a dinosaur and the eight-@@ efficient brands , these things that come and go , but one of them , the eight-@@ plus brand is a pretty strong thing .
an eight-@@ second , played brand . what is your brand ?
if somebody asked them to describe their brand identity , their brand personality , what would they be ?
you &apos;re doing a package ? are you something that is going to bring blood in ?
or are they more like a down ?
are you something that is a little quiet , and is more conservative ?
these things are things that are played , fresh like the roman prince , time , advent@@ ur@@ ous , with@@ fall and love like er@@ ol fl@@ yn@@ n , agile and agile , vo@@ gically , grand , magical and my@@ stical as gand@@ al@@ f .
or are they more like a linear one ?
are you mind@@ ful and mon@@ en like 00@@ 7 ?
are they established , traditionally , nurses , prote@@ ctors , com@@ com@@ bling like oprah ?
are they reliable , stable , family , secure , warm , hear@@ ly , and the way the dalai lama or yo@@ da ?
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies who were up and down , and the &quot; no , &quot; because they wanted to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with this film , because they didn &apos;t have control , no control about the finished product .
but , in fact , 17 brand partners , who were willing to take care of these control , they wanted to take care of their business and play it as awareness , and it &apos;s , eventually , telling us stories that we don &apos;t usually have -- stories that would usually never support .
it makes us tell us that the story of the neuro@@ marketing , as we tell the story in this film , that you &apos;re using mr@@ is now , that you &apos;re using the mr centers of the brain , both for advertising and films .
we went to sao paulo where foreign advertising has been banned .
in the entire city , there &apos;s no time for five years , no poster , no steering , nothing .
and we went to school districts in which companies are moving their way in their own schools , across america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got most of the feedback , or where i had the biggest success , those are where i interact with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
because they went to the middle mate , they went around the agencies , and they said the agencies may not really have their interest in meaning .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and make something completely different , something that people think that the world is challenging .
and what was that for you ? what was successful ?
now , the film in the s@@ und@@ ance film festival , we can look at this .
and it was , according to bur@@ r@@ ale , the first one of january , and since -- and this is not even the whole thing -- there was 900 million up of this film .
it &apos;s actually about two one-@@ and-a-half weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film hasn &apos;t been fooled .
it &apos;s not even online . there &apos;s no shortcut .
he &apos;s not come out of other countries .
now , the film has reached a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every commercial agency that we were talking about to make their clients suggested to make them .
something i firmly believe is that if you take your opportunity to take risks , you get risks in those risks .
i think if you take people off , then you get them closer to failure .
i think that if you use your employees to avoid risks , you &apos;ve prepared the whole company to get a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear of opportunities that they might be afraid .
finally , in progress , we should welcome fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
welcome fear . let &apos;s welcome the risk .
it &apos;s a big lion , so we welcome the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , a bit more honesty .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my collective lecture , &quot; it &apos;s going to be in transparency , &quot; i was asked by the good friends of em@@ c , who paid $ 7@@ 100 for the name of ebay .
big data will transform for organizations around the world in great opportunities .
em@@ c : welcome to transparency .
thank you .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency , this : what &apos;s happened right now ?
this is a great question .
i &apos;ve got a check in my pocket , at the top of the ted organization , the sa@@ op foundation -- a check at $ 7@@ 100 , to fund my ted in the next year .
my name is am@@ it .
i was doing something else 18 months ago , and i decided to do something with museums and art , my che@@ es that are also , gave me green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of fun negotiations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and your access .
i grew up in india .
i became a great education part -- i didn &apos;t cut me -- but i had too many museums and i don &apos;t have access to this art .
when i went and visit these museums , i started to learn a lot .
and while i was working for google , i tried these longing -- art to make it accessible -- with technology .
we then launched a team , a great crew , and we started this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration and tell you some interesting things that happened since the beginning .
so you just go to check@@ lear@@ t@@ proje@@ ct@@ .com.
you can see in all these museums here .
there &apos;s the u@@ ffel ore , the moma , the her@@ om , the ri@@ j@@ les , the van go@@ gh .
i &apos;m even in one of my favorites , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you get to two of them -- very simple .
click , and it &apos;s in the museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bom@@ bay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter .
you go around and you keep it .
you want to look at the museum ?
open the map , and skip it with a click .
you &apos;re in it , you want to get to the end of the gang .
just further . a lot of fun .
get them .
thank you , but the best one is still coming .
so , i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite images , the workers of pin@@ ter bre@@ u@@ gel .
i see this pl@@ us@@ mark .
if the museum gave us the picture , click on it .
now , this is one of the images .
this is all meta@@ data .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i click now .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve done with the so-called gi@@ el@@ ian technology .
this image , for example , has about 10 billion images , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion frames ? &quot;
i &apos;m going to show you this now .
you can zoom in very easily and zoom out .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is un@@ affordable .
but then you really want to get deep inside .
and so i started playing around , and i realized there &apos;s something going on there .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close , and i realized that these kids actually make a difference .
i studied a little , i spoke with some known things with met , and in fact , it was about a game called sources of sources , where a woman was beaten at the dawn of a ride .
apparently it was quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to go close , you can go up to the cracks .
so , just to give you a picture , i zoom out so you can see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best one is still -- in a second .
let &apos;s quickly jump to moma , again in new york .
another favorite picture of me , star night .
in the previous example , it was about finding detail .
but what if you want to see the pink ?
and what if you want to see van go@@ gh doing this master@@ piece ?
you zoom in . you can really go inside .
i &apos;m going to zoom in in one of my favorites to this picture until i really am in the dive .
this is star night , probably never seen this way .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there &apos;s a lot more , but i don &apos;t have time .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
every one of them , everybody -- the same or poor , if you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go and create your own museum online -- from all these pictures , you can put your own collection .
very simple , you go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of the hobby -- you can zoom around .
this is &quot; the split , &quot; in the nation@@ als .
you can put all the messages in your friends , send your friends , and such a conversation about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think in conclusion , for me , the main thing is that all the wonderful things don &apos;t come from google .
they don &apos;t even think about the museums .
i should not say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope we &apos;re just going to get to this digital medium of art , and they &apos;re quite online .
it &apos;s the biggest question that &apos;s asked me recently , &quot; did you do that to replicate the experience of a museum ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it should increase the experience .
that &apos;s the point . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be divided into two camps .
this is the left half , which is the logical one , and then the right half that is the intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure the ap@@ els every hemisphere , we could point your brain .
for example , this is somebody who &apos;s completely logical .
this would be completely intuitive .
now , where would you place your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have decided for one of these extremes , but i think , for most people in the audience , your brain looks something like this -- with a high ap@@ pers that is at the same time .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both exclusive or so on .
you can be logical and intuitive .
and i see myself as one person , collectively , with most experimental quantum physicists , who need a good amount of logic to put together the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good amount of intuition to actually carry the experiments .
how do we develop these intuition ? well , we love to play with things .
so we go out and play and play and look at it , and then we start to develop our intuition .
they basically do the same thing .
so one of the intuitive things that you &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that a thing can be only in a place at the same time .
i mean , it can sound strange to think that a thing is at the same time in two different places , but they weren &apos;t born with this idea , they developed it .
i remember seeing a kid playing on a surface threshold .
he was still a little kid and not very good at it , and he kept going .
but i bet that it was being taught to play with the soil threshold a very precious lesson , which is that big things don &apos;t just let you pass , and that they stay in a place .
and this is a great conceptual model of the world , so long they &apos;re not a particle physicist .
it would be a terrible model for a particle physicist , because they don &apos;t play with the soil , but with those little strange particles .
and if you play with your particles , you find all kinds of weird things -- how they fly directly through walls , or that they can be in two different places at the same time .
and so they all wrote these observations , and they called them the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the state of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little , tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the big everyday objects around us .
that didn &apos;t respond to my intuition , and perhaps because i don &apos;t play as often with particles .
well , i &apos;m sometimes playing with them , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody ever saw a particle .
but my logical possibility didn &apos;t enjoy it either .
because if all the things are made of particles , and all of these particles follow the rules of quantum mechanics , wouldn &apos;t all the rules of quantum mechanics follow ?
i don &apos;t see why this should not be that way .
so i would feel better about the whole thing when we could sort of show that everyday objects also follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
so a few years ago , i went to do exactly that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see that was in quantum mechanical super@@ position .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot in the middle there .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
so here i am . we look at the center here .
and this is a really large picture of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal it &apos;s shaped like a panel board , and it &apos;s above the edge .
so i made this thing in similar ways that you make a computer chip .
i went to a clean space with new silicon slices , and i went for 100 hours to all the big devices .
for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to make this kind of swimming pool and get the thing .
this thing has the ability to be in quantum mechanical super@@ position , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i do all kinds of weird things , but then other people go along and i &apos;m listening to all of these things , because i don &apos;t want to get rid of them , or , frankly , they &apos;re being rejected .
so quantum mechanics says that in@@ mov@@ able objects are just like this .
not only people for in@@ mov@@ able objects are not just people , but the light that appears to them , and the wind that goes over and the heat of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal is quantum mechanical , we had to send all of them out .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we turned out the light , they put it in a vacuum , and they made it out of the air , and they loved it up until almost now , in the elevator , was the piece of metal free to behave .
so we measured its movement .
we found it &apos;s really weird .
instead of just being silent there , it vibrating . the way it was vibrating was something like this -- just like this -- how an expanding and folding bladder .
when we gave him a little push , we could get it to vibra@@ te at the same time and not to vibra@@ te -- something that &apos;s just allowing us to be in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you about is what &apos;s really fantastic .
what does it mean to vibra@@ te at the same time and not to vibra@@ te ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trilli@@ ons of atoms where the piece of metal is silent , and at the same time , the same atoms move up and down .
just to more precise points , they agree .
the rest of the time is calcium .
that means that every atom is at the same time in two different places , which is that the entire piece of metal is two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth me for all this year in the richer space , because , look at it , the scale difference between a single atom and this piece of metal is about the same as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so , if a single atom can be at the same time in two different places , that piece of metal can be in two different places , why not it ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical logical .
so , you think they would be at the same time in multiple places , how would that feel ?
how would your consciousness handle that your body is del@@ oc@@ zed in the space ?
there &apos;s another aspect of the story .
when we stood up , the lights got used and looked inside the box , we saw that the piece of metal was always there in a piece .
and so i had to design this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator in reality are just the objects that are in a small space together .
you hear a lot about how quantum mechanics says everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite true .
there &apos;s more back there , it goes deeper .
it &apos;s so that these compounds , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are . and that &apos;s the profound and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided we should be able to figure out how we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that when families think about where they live and work , they give them the possibility between at least one hand of different cities who are all in competition around new residents .
right now we &apos;re far away from this target .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t even have a single city to be welcome to .
but the amazing thing about cities is it &apos;s worth so much more than it is to build .
so we could get the world very easily with du@@ z@@ end , perhaps hundreds of new cities .
now , this may sound absurd for you , unless you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
now , just trade your homes from home to cities .
imagine that half of the people who want to live in homes did it already ; the other half yet not .
you could try to expand the capacity of existing homes .
but you know what you &apos;re going to be doing , in those apartments , and your environment , to avoid the law , to avoid dis@@ pair@@ ing and escape .
so it turns out to be very hard to get all of these exten@@ sions .
but you could go to a completely new place , a completely new block of living , allowing the laws to support such and not stop it .
so i suggested that governments provide new areas that offer enough place for a city and gave them a name : charter cities .
so later , i discovered that , about the same time , ja@@ 4 and oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o have thought about the challenge of a reform in hon@@ dur@@ as .
they knew that every year about 7@@ 5,000 hon@@ dur@@ ans were leaving their country to come to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to ensure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same in hon@@ dur@@ as .
now , at this point , ja@@ four to oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o said , &quot; what happens when we &apos;re going to take it to the surface of our country -- what if we &apos;re just going to take them a message -- a part of the american message -- a part of the canadian table -- a part of the canadian rules , and if people are going to work under the canadian rules , and they &apos;re going to work on the surface of the news , they &apos;re usually going to go to canada or america
in the summer of 2009 , hon@@ dur@@ as suffered under a major dis@@ placement .
in the next set of industrial elections , pe@@ pe lo@@ bo won in a circulation , whose program promised both of them , as well .
he asked oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o to become his stable check .
in the meantime , i prepared myself to talk at tedglobal .
in progress , trying and study by the study of consumers , i &apos;ve tried to reduce this complicated concept of charter city .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you don &apos;t have existing housing owners already .
we &apos;re going to face new technologies , but for progress , it needs technology and laws , and it &apos;s for common laws .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o sent the link to the tedtalk .
again , he showed him ja@@ 4 .
the two called me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present the head of our country . &quot;
so we met december in december in december of a hotels in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make sure how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than it costs them .
and i used this graph to show how valuable ro@@ hl@@ and is in a place like new york , think that a place in some cases is worth thousands of dollars per square meter .
but it was a very abstract discussion , at a point when there was a pause , oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o said , &quot; paul , maybe we could look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so , in a very simple form , a charter city is a place where a charter city is a place , which is the beginning of un@@ inhabited land , a green contract , which suggests the law that &apos;s going to be there and the possibility of being able to determine either or not .
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of hon@@ dur@@ as , which meant that we need to be able to do this project , that it &apos;s important , and that &apos;s the way to bring our country forward .
i was asked to come to te@@ gu@@ ci@@ gal@@ pa , and i was in the fourth and fifth of january .
so i &apos;ve been able to put a lot of the facts with facts that have a graph like this , trying to make sure that if you want to make a lot value in a city , it must be a very big city .
this is a picture of the city , and the sketch is the new airport that was built in den@@ ver .
this airport alone has 100 square miles .
so , i tried to convince the hon@@ dur@@ ans to try and make a new city , you have to start with an area at least 1,000 square miles .
this is more than 250 acres .
58 all appl@@ au@@ d .
the faces of the audience were very serious and notice .
the director of the convention came to the stage and said , &quot; professor ro@@ mer , i thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
i have him on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i &apos;ve come to the point that a new city gives people new possibilities .
it would be the opportunity to live in a city that would be in hon@@ dur@@ as , rather than hundreds of miles away north .
and a new city also includes new possibilities for leaders .
the leaders of the government , in hon@@ dur@@ as , would depend on the help of mate , but they could benefit from their partner to make the laws of the law for this charter , and to support that everybody can trust that the charter is actually being done .
and the notion of president lo@@ bo , was that the certainty of the trans@@ union that i &apos;ve been thinking about as a way to get foreign investors to build and build this city would be more important for all parties in hon@@ dur@@ as , for many years of fear and mi@@ str@@ ust .
we went into a field .
this picture is from this place .
it &apos;s a thousand square miles .
and shortly after that , on the 19th 19th century , they voted with congress to change the constitution , to have a negoti@@ ation force that &apos;s available to special development areas .
in a country that has just been a huge crisis behind congress , in the congress , was elected by this gathering change by 1@@ 24 .
all parties , all the requests of society , supported this .
but to become part of the constitution , it has to be approved by congress twice .
on february 17th , it was approved for the second time with 1@@ 14 .
immediately after this election , between the 21st and the 24@@ th , february , a delegation of about 30 ac@@ dur@@ ans , to the two places of the world that are most interested in being in the business of the city .
the one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a large , new urban grid , which is built in southern korea -- big than the city of the city .
everything you can see in this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get permission .
the other place that was very interested in the city is singapore .
it &apos;s been built in china already , and the third is in preparation .
so if you think about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
you &apos;ve already got a blueprint , and you &apos;re already looking at this area for the second town .
it &apos;s already been working on a legal system that deals , and it &apos;s also working on an external legal system .
a country has already offered his supreme court to provide his supreme court , as a court , for the obvious appeal of the floating court system .
and also urban designers and nurses are very interested .
they even get funding .
one thing , as you already know , has been covered , there &apos;s plenty of mine .
there are lots of factories that would like to be in america , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there are many people who would like to live there .
around the world , there are 700 million people saying that they like to live on a different place .
a million people out of latin america and walking into the united states .
many of them are fathers who are forced to take their families back to work -- sometimes there &apos;s single mothers who have to make enough money to make food and clothes .
unfortunately , it &apos;s even kids who try to find their parents who are trying to find their parents , in some cases , since a decade .
so what &apos;s the idea of thinking about this in hon@@ dur@@ as a new new city ?
or even to build from these cities , or hundreds of all over the world ?
so what is it for an idea to make sure that every family has a choice between multiple cities that are in competition around new residents ?
this is an idea worth spreading .
my friends from hon@@ dur@@ as asked me to say , thank you ted .
you know how many decisions you make in a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions you make in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve recently done a survey with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices that are afraid to make a typical american is 80 .
and also , recently , a study with ceos was done for a week for a week .
and these scientists have just documented the different topics that these ceos are doing , and how much time they used to make decisions that hang together with the issues .
and they found that an average ceo is working in the week with 13@@ 9 tasks .
each of these topics was of course , of course , many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions , they took an hour or more of their time .
think about your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you meet in the nine minutes of magnitude in one hour ?
how good do you think they &apos;re doing the decisions ?
today , i want to talk about one of the biggest decision-making issues of our modern time , the decision-making problem .
i want to talk about the problem and about some kinds of solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise it , because i &apos;m blind , just if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , my first question is today : are you ready to hear about the decision-making problem ?
thank you .
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very exclusive lifestyle , at least it was really exclusive .
it was a place called the dra@@ e@@ ger .
this business , it was almost like a sense of pleasure .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and gulf and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was at a time when we &apos;ve actually been drinking water .
i loved it to go to this business , but at one point i &apos;ve asked myself , well , how do you never buy anything ?
here &apos;s the olive oil gang .
they were about 75 different kinds of olive oil , including the ones that were locked in boxes , who came from thousands of old olive trees .
so i decided to go one day , and i asked the head , and i asked the head , &quot; does this model make people really offer these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up on the bus charges of touri@@ sts who would come every day and typically have their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose mar@@ mel@@ ade for our experiment .
here &apos;s her mar@@ et ride .
they had 3@@ 48 different kinds of mar@@ mel@@ ade .
we &apos;ve put a little bit of pressure on the entrance right now .
we &apos;ve put out six different tastes of garbage , or 24 different tastes of dna , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , what would i be like to be more people , and trying to get out of mars ?
there are more people left when it was 24 , about 60 percent than it was six , about 40 percent .
and then we looked at what was the case of people buying a glass of mar@@ mel@@ ade .
now we saw the melting effect .
from the people who stayed there when it was 24 , only three percent actually bought a glass of mar@@ mel@@ ade .
now , from the people who stayed there when it was six , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of mar@@ mel@@ ade .
now , if you calculate it , people would buy six times a glass of mar@@ mel@@ ade , who they had six to choice than they had 24 .
now , not to buy a glass of mar@@ mel@@ ade is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our wa@@ illa -- but it turns out that the decision-making problem is affecting us also in very core choices .
we don &apos;t choose to decide , even though it comes to our best interests .
so the theme of the day : financial saving .
i &apos;m going to describe you now , i &apos;m going to describe a study that i &apos;m doing with gu@@ r hu@@ ber@@ man , e@@ en@@ ica , and i used to make decisions for the diagnosis of almost almost one million americans from about 650 plans in the entire united states .
and what we saw was whether the number of the fon@@ s , which was a pension plan possible , the 40@@ 1 plan that affects probability to be saved for tomorrow .
and we found that there was a connection in fact .
so in this plans , we &apos;ve had about 6@@ 57 plans that people do something between two to 59 different funds .
and what we found was that the more fund was in fact that the participation was lower .
now , if you look at the extremes , the plans , the two funds , had a sub@@ set in the 70s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that close almost 60 fund , the divided rate was now about the sixth percentage .
now , it turns out that even if you &apos;re going to join yourself when more possibilities stood , even then , it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate , rather than that , is that the more opportunities to be available , the more it tends to evapo@@ late it and to vote .
the more possibilities for them , the more they would put their money in just just money .
none of these extreme decisions are heard about the decisions that someone would recommend when their future financial well-being matters .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve observed three essential consequences in people that make more and more choices .
they push the decision -- shut up , even when it comes to their own best interests .
they make more miserable decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re more likely to make themselves feel less satisfied , even if they do more objective .
the main reason for this is that we may enjoy this huge shelves of may@@ on@@ a@@ ise , mustard , v@@ and mar@@ mel@@ ade , but we can &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to take the comparison and beyond , and then you can actually choose something from the fantastic service .
so what i want to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways and different research places -- they can just apply in your business .
first of all , limited .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true than today , that less is more .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; narrow . &quot;
they &apos;re always concerned that they lose .
but in fact , we see it more , more and more , that if you &apos;re willing to be willing to get too small , and the in@@ important in@@ important possibilities are going on , now there &apos;s a cost of sales , and it will reduce the cost , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s an improvement of decision-making .
as pro@@ ctor and gamble , the different head of the world , the different head of 26 were reduced to 15 , they experienced a percentage of sales at 10 percent .
when the golden cat corporation was going to go to the worst of the world , you would notice , you know , the profits had dropped by 87 percent -- a result of the rise of sales and reducing cost .
you know , the average superhero today , it gives you 4@@ 5,000 products .
it gives you 100,000 products today .
but the ninth largest supermarket in the world today is al@@ di , and they give them 1,@@ 400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in a dose .
now in the world of savings , i think one of the best examples that has recently come to the market , about how best the choices were , was something that david la@@ adi@@ son has made very strong , it &apos;s a program that is offered at harvard .
every single harvard staff is automatically taking care of a lifetime fund .
those who really want to meet a selection will be 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know , how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to make it clear .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the staff is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if their employees can &apos;t keep them apart , their customers don &apos;t . &quot;
now , before we started lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be willing to offer all of the people in this audience in the middle of this audience to provide the most beautiful road in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i want to tell you that .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read them , and then i want to clap it up , if you &apos;re willing to take a hug .
okay . everybody &apos;s willing to take gary &apos;s prize .
are you all ?
okay , let me show you some more of this .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
now , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i &apos;ve probably heard more hands .
good .
in fact , it &apos;s objective to the first time the first time , more information than the second time , but i would argue that they thought it was the second time .
because the pictures made it feel real .
which brings me to the second technology that helps you deal with the problem of decision-making , it &apos;s the speci@@ tization .
it &apos;s because people , to understand the difference between possibilities , have to understand what consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that &apos;s what the consequences have to be able to be able to feel .
why are people using average to 30 to 30 percent more if they use a dollar map or a credit card than in cash ?
because we don &apos;t really feel money .
and it turns out that if you make it that something feels specific , it &apos;s a very good tool to save people to save .
so we &apos;ve done in a study that i &apos;ve done with s@@ hl@@ om@@ o ben@@ ar@@ ro and aless@@ and@@ ro ch@@ ter@@ ro , and we &apos;ve done a study with the people at ring -- employees that were all working for cooking -- and those people were all in a meeting where they were all in their pension plan .
and during this meeting , we &apos;ve got this meeting just like it used to be , except we added a small amount .
the small thing that we &apos;ve added was that we asked people to think about all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they save money .
in fact , that we did this simple thing , there was an increase in participation by 20 percent , and there was an increase of the number of people who were willing to save or increase four percent of the cost that they were willing to pay for the savings account .
third technology : robo@@ or@@ zation .
we can better deal with more categories than more choices .
so , for example , this is a study we made in a timeline .
it turns out it &apos;s in the path of super@@ markets , and down in the northeast area , variation the number between 3@@ 31 different kinds of magazines up to 6@@ 64 of magazines .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 chapters , and i &apos;m going to show you 400 categories , or i &apos;m going to show you 400 chapters , and those in 20 categories , you think i &apos;ve given you more choices and a better policy experience when i gave them 400 and a better policy .
because the categories tell me how i can make it apart .
and there are two kinds of caps .
it &apos;s called &quot; jazz , &quot; and the other is called &quot; manifest@@ . &quot;
if you think the left ad is cast , and the ad on the right is jazz , you clap in your hands .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
if you think that the one on the left is jazz and that , on the right-hand side , is a clapping , please clap .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is jazz , and the one on the right is gross , but you know what ?
this is a highly useful entity .
the categories need to say something , not to provide the selection .
and this problem is often , if you look at the long list of all this fund .
who want you to do it ?
my fourth technology : premise for complexity .
it turns out we can actually handle more information than we think we have to simplify them .
we need to grow the complexity slowly .
i &apos;m going to show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the purchase of a car .
here &apos;s a clear car maker that gives you the possibility of making your car completely competitive .
you have to make in 62 different decisions to design your car completely .
now these decisions are now different in the number of choices that make them decision .
car colors , foreign color of the car -- i have 56 options .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
what i &apos;m doing now is , i change the order in which the decisions are .
half of them will go from the many possibilities , 56 car colors to the small possibilities , four wea@@ gs .
the other half of the customers goes from the low possibilities , four instructions , to the 56 car colors , many possibilities .
what am i looking for ?
how are they interested .
if you &apos;re all using the standard choices in the decision , it means that you &apos;re going to be over@@ engaged , the heal@@ est , i &apos;ll lose it .
what you find is that the people that are going to go from the many to the number of choices , and again , the standard choice .
we lose it .
go from the little choices to the many , then they remain .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the order that this information is .
when i start to start , i &apos;m learning how to choose .
even though , even though the instructions choose , i don &apos;t know about my preferences in the interior , it &apos;s still going to make me choose .
it also raises me in excitement about the big product that i put together , and so i &apos;m willing to motivate me to be interested in it .
let me sum up .
i &apos;ve told you four techniques that the problem of the decision-making increase -- small -- will they get rid of the surplus alternatives -- they &apos;ll make it real -- make it real ; we can do better with more categories , less possibilities about complexity .
every one of these techniques i &apos;m going to describe today is to help you manage the possibilities -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for the people they provide service .
because i think the key to the best possible choice is that you are selective .
and the more we are selective with select , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin allo@@ c@@ ca , tr@@ s manager at youtube . i &apos;m looking at youtube videos .
that &apos;s true .
today , we want to talk about how videos are vir@@ ized , and then , why is it important .
we all want to be stars -- celebri@@ ties , singers , comedi@@ ans -- when i was young , it seemed so powerful .
but web videos have enabled us to all , or all of our creative activities , in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be about the internet to the next saturday .
but on youtube , more than 48 hours per minute is uploaded .
it &apos;s going to be just a tiny percentage of a tiny percentage , and it will look at thousands and thousands of times .
so how does this work ?
three things : ta@@ ste@@ maker , com@@ pity communities and unexpected .
well , then we want .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
wo@@ ah !
who@@ hh , vodka !
last year , kab@@ vas@@ quez gave this video that he filmed before his house in yo@@ semi@@ te park .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
this graph shows what it looked like when the video was popular last summer .
in fact , you don &apos;t want a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because that &apos;s what you do when you name yo@@ semi@@ te berg .
he had uploaded lots of natural videos .
and this video was actually already sent in january of january .
what &apos;s happened here ?
there was jimmy kim@@ mel .
jimmy kim@@ mel led the tweet that made the video so popular .
because ta@@ ste@@ maker like jimmy kim@@ eve asks us new and interesting things , and show you a big audience .
it &apos;s friday , friday , friday . sit down on friday . all right . friday , friday -- friday , friday , friday . sa@@ ck on friday , i hope we would take these entertainment without talking about this video , i hope .
rebecca bl@@ ac@@ ks , &quot; friday &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it was looked at almost 200 million times this year .
this is the picture .
just like &quot; double rain , &quot; it seems to be coming from the nothing .
what &apos;s going on on this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also open .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
now , to@@ sh@@ .@@ 0 went on , many blogs started writing about it .
michael j. nelson nelson : the former science theater was a first one who made a joke on twitter .
what &apos;s important is that a person or a group of ta@@ ste@@ maker took a point of view , shared with a big audience , and therefore accelerated the process .
and then this community was formed by people who shared this big spirit , and i started playing about it .
now there &apos;s 10,000 paro@@ dies from friday to youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a paro@@ ling for every single day .
unlike the course of the 20th century , the community &apos;s participation is to become part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or something new .
&quot; n@@ yan cat &quot; is animation and music in the end loop .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
this year , it was almost 50 million times .
and if you think that &apos;s crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a three-@@ hour version that has been looked at four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats looking at this video .
it &apos;s important , the creativity that is in the internet culture and geeks .
there was remix .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole re@@ mi@@ x community pulled off the ground that made it from a stupid joke to something we can all participate on .
today , we don &apos;t just think about things , we do .
who would have seen this ?
who could predict &quot; double rain &quot; or rebecca black , or &quot; n@@ yan cat &quot; ?
which books are able to write your writing in which it is ?
in a world , in which every minute of two days , video video is uploaded , can only be quite unique and unexpected as they were talking about .
i admit , i wasn &apos;t really interested in that when a friend told me , i want to look at this great video , about a guy who prote@@ cts in new york for bicycles for bicycles .
i got a parking ticket , because i was not driving on the gun of the gun , but there &apos;s a lot of disability that you don &apos;t have to go to the tail .
because it was completely surprising and humor@@ ful , casey ni@@ est@@ lt was fun , and his argument is five million times .
this approach is true of everything we &apos;re creative .
and all of this leads us to a big question .
what does that mean ?
who@@ h@@ hh .
what does that mean ?
ta@@ ste@@ maker , creative community communities , completely unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access to , and the audience is popular .
as i said , one of the big stars -- justin guards -- made his start at youtube .
no one needs to give your ideas green .
and today , we &apos;re all feeling as our pop culture as well .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media , and they don &apos;t meet the characteristics of the ancient media , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how do i talk about the connection between women about three generations , and how the amazing strength of these inter@@ connectedness were grounded in the lives of a four-@@ year girl , when they were in the lives of a four-@@ year girl in the lives of a four-@@ year girl , whose mother and her grandmother was holding five days in san francisco , and this is a little girl who lives in san francisco , and she &apos;s talking to them today ?
the story is not over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still being put together .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzle pieces .
imagine the first piece : a man that burns his life .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life was held by the simple hope of unity and freedom of his home .
think of it as the march of the communist in sa@@ ig@@ on in sa@@ ig@@ on , how he must be aware that his life was a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , were s@@ or@@ ing his friends .
he went back to silence .
he died , broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i &apos;ve never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never forgot me his life .
i had to make sure that it was not for free , and it was my job to learn that the story was really trying to crush us , but we stood .
the next puzzle of the puzzle shows how a boat is running in the early mor@@ ig@@ red red .
my mother was 18 , when her father died -- already in an arranged marriage , with two little girls .
for them , they asked her a task : the flight of your family and a new life in australia .
it was completely extinct that it could fail .
after a four@@ -year-old and film wheels sa@@ ga gli@@ tt , a boat kept silent on the lake as a fishing boat .
all adults were aware of the risks .
the most frightening fear they had , rape and death .
as most adults on the boat , my mother wore a little toxic bottle .
in a cap@@ war , my sister and i would have bought my grandmother and my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- the sticky tu@@ bs of the engine , the clapping of a wave on the bug , the vast and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pir@@ ates that came out of a lot of time , but from the death council of the men on our boat , or on the fall of the engine that didn &apos;t want to start six hours .
but i remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the holocaust coast , and the young man who collapsed and died , and the end of the journey was too much for him , and to the taste of the first cold rock that gave me one of the men on the platform .
no apple ever did it again .
after three months in the refugee camp , we landed in mel@@ bour@@ ne .
and the next puzzle is about four women in three generations that are building together a new life .
we let us down in football ray , one of the women &apos;s children &apos;s class , whose population is made of im@@ termin@@ atory layers .
in other words , in the ancient middle middle class places , which was completely unknown to me , there was no tests in football .
the smells of la@@ ps came from the rest of the world .
and the fat got broken english between people who had one thing in common : they started fresh .
my mother worked in farms , then on a running band in a car factory , six days , double layers .
it kind of seemed to find the time to get english into english and speci@@ cations .
we were poor .
every dollar has been divided , and it was put into more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we needed to buy . mostly the new stuff that came from the second hand .
two floors for school , every one to cover the holes in the other .
a high school uniform to the buttons , because she had to pass six years .
and , you know , the rare , they were very painful , and they were , &quot; bad eye , &quot; and there it goes , &quot; asi@@ ans , goes home . &quot;
home where ?
something invaded me .
there was a meeting to reconciliation and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other from our day , and we heard the movement of our grandmother &apos;s movement .
my mother suffered in night@@ dreams from the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake every night until their nightmare came to get it .
and she opened a computer company , then made a goodbye education , and he opened a company .
and the women came with their stories about men who didn &apos;t get the change , angry and in@@ flexible , and sor@@ ty-@@ filled kids , trapped between two worlds .
nurses and spon@@ sors were regarded .
centers were built .
i was living in parallel worlds .
in one , i was the classic asian student , which was un@@ subtle to himself .
in the other hand , i was involved in un@@ certain life , the tragic sc@@ ars of force , the drug abuse of the drug .
but so many people got over the years .
and because of this aid , i was asked by the last year of the post-@@ trial as the boy of the year .
and i was turned on from a puzzle to the next cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ te , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan , anony@@ me , un@@ me , anonymous , refugee , refugee and social activist , who was invited to talk to places that had never been invited to places , and in weather , whose existence would never be able to imagine .
i was not familiar with the labels .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the bribe .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to the routine and the comfort of life of an unknown ancestor -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters , and a mother and two daughters , who were telling each other to each other of their day as well as 20 years , and we were still in the same bed .
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t .
it reminded me that now i was so old as it was when we got the boat .
no one was an opportunity .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so , i spoke about ju@@ genesis and education , and the dis@@ pair@@ ment of the margin@@ alized and dis@@ mis@@ ted .
and the open i spoke , the more i should tell .
i met people in all of them , so many of them did what they loved , living on the boundaries of the possible .
and even though i graduated , i realized i could not find a career in jur@@ a .
there must be another puzzle .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be an under@@ under@@ dog , a re@@ tail@@ ling , new in the picture -- and not just okay , but something you must be grateful about , maybe a gift of the boat .
because in places , it can take so easily to collapse in the horizon , it can mean that you accept the assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;ve gone enough from my well-being to know that , yes , the world breaks apart , not as you worry .
opportunities that would not have been allowed , that were explicit .
there was a energy , an un@@ subtle optimism , a strange mix@@ alty of the humility and the danger .
so i followed my gut feeling .
i was collected a little team of people around me , for which the pro@@ count is not going to be , &quot; an unfair challenge . &quot;
we don &apos;t have a cent for a year .
at the end of one day , i was cooking a huge pile of gear that we shared .
we worked late to the night .
most of our ideas were mad , but it was a few brilliant , and we managed to move the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull into the u.s.
just a journey there .
my gut feeling again .
i was moved three months later , and the adventure went on .
before i leave the talk , i &apos;d like to tell you about my grandmother .
it grew up at a time where con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism was the social norm , and the local woman was the most important person .
life hasn &apos;t changed for centuries since centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
her mother was taking her up .
at 17 , she was a woman &apos;s second woman whose mother beat her .
without your husband &apos;s support , she was making it a sense by bringing him to court , and she was in her own case , and it was even more powerful than she won .
&quot; i don &apos;t think &quot; it was un@@ inhabited .
i just met in a hotel room in sydney when she died . 1,000 miles away in mel@@ bour@@ ne .
i was looking at the side of the wall , and i looked at it on the other side .
i knew she had come to stop .
my mother called me a few minutes after this .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in football ray and sat around her sar@@ g .
we told her stories , and we would ask her that we were still with her .
by midnight , the monk came , and he said he must close the sars .
my mother asked us to make her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm , and the rest of you is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because they &apos;ve been holding this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; they didn &apos;t leave them . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s through women .
you see who we were , and how it &apos;s shaped us , now we can see that the men who might have come into our lives would have come to us .
failure would have been too simple .
now , i would like my own kids , and i &apos;m still thinking about the boat .
who would ever wish ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , in ease , in terms of scarcity .
can i give you a bug in your life , which is the courageous of each wave , the courageous , cleaning of the engine , the far horizon that doesn &apos;t guarantee anything ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give that and make it safe , i would do it .
and also , the mother today is the fourth or fifth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it even photography ?
because , of course , this is a picture that you can &apos;t capture with your camera .
and yet , my interest in photography , when i received my first digital camera , at age 15 .
i put it in my former pre@@ ference for drawing , but it was a bit different , because the camera was actually using the process in planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , it ends the process when you squeeze on the trigger .
so for me , in photography , it seemed to be more about being in the right place at the right time .
i thought everybody could do that .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts when the trigger is going to happen .
photos like this : a blueprint along a lot of street .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and yet , it &apos;s a realistic level .
or photos like this -- dark and color@@ ful at the same time , but everybody with the common goal to keep a realistic level .
when i say reality , i mean photo@@ -@@ reality .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can really capture , but i want to make it look like you could have that , in a photograph .
photos where you have to think about a brief moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more likely to capture an idea than really a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it look realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about light ?
what makes the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be done on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what is realistic , but what we think is realistic .
so , i think the basics are very simple .
i see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and put together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example of this .
we have three , perfect physical objects here , which we all can identify in a three-dimensional world .
but being combined in a certain way , you can create something that looks still three-dimensional as if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that that &apos;s not possible .
so we over@@ post our brains , because our brains just don &apos;t know that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combining photos .
it &apos;s really about combining different realities .
so the things that make a picture look realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things around us .
but if you combine pictures , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise you just look wrong .
so i would say there &apos;s three simple rules to follow , to get a realistic outcome .
as you can see , this is not three special images .
but you can build something special like this .
so the first rule is that combining photos should have the same perspective .
secondly , combined photos should have the same lighting .
and these two pictures fulfill these two things -- the same altitude , and the same lighting .
third , it &apos;s about being able to make it possible , where the individual images start and end by connecting it to it .
it makes it impossible to say how the photo was actually put together .
so , using color , contrast and hel@@ li@@ ess on the edges of the edges , the fish of fish on the edges , like field depth , de@@ je@@ cted colors and disorders , we wipe the boundaries between the different images , and let them look like a single photo , even though a picture can contain hundreds of levels .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think this is just a landscape of land , and the bottom part was manipulated .
but this picture is actually completely distributed , from photos of different places .
i personally think it &apos;s easier to create a place , to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to make a habit with the ideas in your head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and as i had this idea in winter , i knew i needed several months to plan to plan to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish was taken on a crowded trip .
the bank comes from another place .
the underwater part comes from a rock .
and yes , i even cut the house up on the island of red to make it look swiss .
so to reach a realistic outcome , it &apos;s going to go from me to planning .
i always start with an oven , an idea .
it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
and here &apos;s a piece of very well planned .
and then when you make good photographs , the outcome can be pretty beautiful , and it &apos;s quite realistic .
so , it &apos;s all the tools there , and the only thing that turns out to us is our imagination .
thank you .
i would like to talk to you about why so many electronic health projects failed .
and i think the most important point is we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things we introduced on the sc@@ ard popular university was to make a major audience .
you don &apos;t think of it particularly scientifically -- it &apos;s a cup of coffee or tea , and the patients , families , relatives , &quot; how do they go ?
how do we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the major problems , why everyone -- perhaps most of the electronic health projects failed , because we stopped listening .
this is my wireless wa@@ ck . this is a very simple thing .
it &apos;s got a button .
and every morning i turn on .
and yeah , i have a task , as you might recognize .
i put my job on 95 pounds .
it just works : every time i wake up on the floor , you send my data to google health .
and they &apos;re also called from my general doctor , so that he can see where my weight problem is , not just the moment that i need kar@@ gic support or something , but also with a glimpse of the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
you may be familiar with that , i &apos;ve got 4,000 followers on twitter .
so every morning , i go to my w@@ lan@@ -@@ wa@@ ck , and people talk to me before i &apos;m sitting in the car , and i &apos;m going to say , &quot; lunch for lunch , i would like to say , &quot; to lunch . &quot;
but this is the most net thing that can happen , because this is being driven to help patients help patients , because it could be used against obesity , or it could be used for obesity .
it may also be used to get people out of their chairs , and to get them to play together in a way to play their health .
next week , this is the market .
it will give you this little blood pressure device that you can get into an iphone or something .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure , to send it to their physician and share it for example , for something more than 100 dollars .
at this point , the patients come to the game , and they can &apos;t just take control of control of their own ship , but can also help us care about the challenges of the challenges that are in front of us , and the cost explosion of healthcare , twice demand , and so on .
they make ways that are easy to use and start to hug patients in the team .
and that can be done by these kinds of techniques , but also through crowd@@ source .
and one of the things we did , i want to share with you through a quick video .
we have all the navigation systems in our cars .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
we know exactly where all the money equipment around it is .
we know another one where all the walls are .
and sure , we can find fast food chains .
but where was the next a@@ ed to help this patient ?
we asked around , and no one knew it .
no one knew where to find the next life-@@ saving a@@ ed in this moment .
so what did we do ? we &apos;ve done crowd@@ sourcing in the netherlands .
we &apos;ve been building a website , and we asked a human mass , &quot; if you look at an a@@ ed , please share with us where he is , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed during business times , of course .
and about 10,000 a@@ eds have been so@@ cked in the netherlands already .
the next step was to find the apps .
and we designed an i@@ pa@@ d app .
we developed an app for cavi@@ ar , extended reality to find these a@@ eds .
and if you &apos;re in a city like ma@@ a@@ stri@@ st , and someone collapsed , you can use your iphone , and within the next couple of weeks , your micro@@ software mobile phone , to find the next a@@ ed , can save life .
and today , we don &apos;t just want to do this as a@@ ed@@ 4@@ u , as the product is called , but as a@@ ed@@ 4@@ us .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
and we &apos;re asking our colleagues all around the world , from other universities , about helping us behave , to behave , to change these a@@ eds around the world .
and if you &apos;re in holiday , and someone collapsed , it &apos;s your own relatives or somebody else , you can find an a@@ ed .
the other thing we want to ask is that companies around the world are helping us to help us get this a@@ eds .
these could be wack@@ ously services , or technicians for example , just to make sure that the previous one is still in his place .
please help us and try and make health not just make a difference , but to take it .
thank you .
today , i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
i work in the solar technology .
and my little startu@@ p wants us to force for environment by ...
it &apos;s giving rise .
here &apos;s a short video of what we do .
oh . a moment .
it might take it until it &apos;s stolen .
now -- we can just jump out -- i &apos;m just going to skip the video .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
solar technology is ...
oh , my time is past ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design , and work in a year to work and work in an environment that is so much everything that they really hate , we &apos;ve got them working in government .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a bit like peace caps for computer geeks .
we choose some fellows every year , and we let them work with urban budgets .
instead of sending them to the third world , we send them into ra@@ th@@ ts .
and they developed great apps , working with urban collaborators .
but what they really do is to show what &apos;s possible today .
so they meet al .
al is a hydr@@ ant in the city of boston .
here it looks like it &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is somebody who gets rid of it , when he &apos;s on it , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at the fire unless he &apos;s covered by a meter of the snow .
how did he get to search for this particular way ?
we had a team of fellows in boston last year called &quot; code for america . &quot;
they were in february of february , and it &apos;s been a lot like the last february .
and they realized that the city will never have the same fire .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik lar@@ el@@ s-@@ ob@@ he , he noticed something else , and that was , the residents were getting the side@@ walks off the window .
so he did what every good developer would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you adopted a fire hydr@@ ant .
you listen to him to the window , if it stops .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take away .
so there &apos;s a nice little play dynamic .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that fellows have written last year .
but it does something that does not make other government technology .
they &apos;re spreading .
there &apos;s this guy in the i.@@ r. department of hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u , who has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but so that the citizens were adop@@ ting the tsunami .
it &apos;s very important that these villages work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check her .
and then , in seattle , seattle decided to use the app , to get the citizens to clean the sweat@@ tu@@ ys .
and chicago has just launched them so that people get rid of bu@@ er@@ ll@@ walks , if it stops .
we now know nine cities that plan to use this app .
and it &apos;s increased , organic , of course .
if you know something about government technology , you know it doesn &apos;t usually happen .
the creation of software takes a few years into the rule .
we had a team working on a project last year in boston for three and a half months .
it was a way of trying to figure out the parents who are the right public schools for their children .
we got told later that when it was going to go over the normal channels , it would have taken over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
there &apos;s now a project in california in california , which cost the tax pa@@ yer so far , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of the government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spreading by itself , it &apos;s a kind of shot to the institution of the government .
it shows how the government could work better -- not more like a private company , how many people think it should .
and not even like a tech company , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more important to this app is that it represents a new generation , which is the problem of government -- not as the problem of a sales institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good at collective action .
now there &apos;s a big community of people making the tools that we need to put things together .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america &quot; fellows , there are hundreds of people all over the country who write up and write government apps every day in their own communities .
they don &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re terribly frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it , they repair them .
and these people know what we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and this is then , if you all forget about the emotion of politics and the snake in the workplace and all the other things that we &apos;re really excited about , is government , in the words of tim o &apos; rei@@ l@@ ly , &quot; what we do in common . &quot;
now , a lot of people have given up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of these people , i want you to think about it , because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is change .
and because the government will end up giving their power out of us -- remember , &quot; we &apos;re the people ? &quot; as we think about , will affect how this change is happening .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
and how many people , i thought , that the government is mostly about choosing people in office .
now , after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s all about communities to go .
this is the call center for service and information .
you usually get out of your city in 3@@ 11 .
if you ever have to have a chance to work in your urban call center , like our fellow scott sil@@ ent@@ man , as part of the program -- in fact , you do all of that -- you &apos;re going to see that the people who call government for many different problems , including that a thylacine is in their house .
so scott gets this resource .
he &apos;s in the official database .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the animal .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , you can open all the doors in your house and play very loud music , and see if the livestock is ? &quot;
and that worked . round for scott .
but that was not the end of the thylacine .
boston was not just a call center .
it has an app , a web and manual app , called lifes@@ ties .
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is the work very clever people at the office of the new urban doodle in boston .
one day -- this is a real report -- that was in the same term : &quot; thylacine rat in my trash can &apos;t say if it &apos;s dead .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
but what happens to &quot; lifes@@ connect &quot; is different .
scott under@@ held himself to man .
but in &quot; lifes@@ connect &quot; is all public , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next post that we got was , &quot; i went over there , found the mi@@ ton behind the house .
wood ? yes . alive ? y@@ ap .
turned out the mi@@ ton . went home .
good night , sweet thylacine . &quot;
pretty simple .
this is great . this is the physical one .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is getting to crowd@@ source .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m talking more about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
an citizen helped another citizen , but the government played a central role here .
they connected these two people .
and you could have been able to connect them to government services if they were required , but a neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative to government services .
if a neighbor helps other , we streng@@ our communities .
let &apos;s call the animal animal , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things we have to think about is that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they think that one is the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is deciding .
how often did we choose a political leader -- and sometimes we &apos;ve used a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we &apos;re going to go back and we expect the government to reflect our values and have our needs , and then not changed much ?
this is because the government is like a wider ocean , and politics is the top 15@@ th .
and what &apos;s below is what we call bureau@@ cracy .
and we use this word with this contemp@@ t .
but it &apos;s this contemp@@ t that we have , that we own , and we pay to be something that works against us , something else , and then we moved ourselves .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we have to make bureau@@ cracy sexy .
because this is where the real government work is happening .
we need to rely on the machinery of the government .
so the census movement has done it .
do you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of anxiety citizens writing a very detailed , 3@@ 25 micro@@ report , which is an answer to the se@@ c me@@ mo about the law for financial reform .
it &apos;s not political , it &apos;s the office active .
well , for those of us who gave up the government , it &apos;s time we think about the world we want to leave our kids .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges you have to imagine .
do we really think we &apos;re reaching what we need to achieve without improving an institution that can be used by all of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible to make the function of the government fundamentally in a way that can actually achieve something by empowering society .
and there &apos;s a generation that has grown up the internet , and that knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build the only systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost one generation older than most of them .
this is a generation that has grown up to see their voice as granted .
they &apos;re not fighting this struggle that we all struggle with , about who can talk ; they &apos;re allowed to talk .
you can make your opinion , in every channel at every channel , and you do it .
so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , you don &apos;t worry about using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve the government of government .
and these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
that might be , a fire hydr@@ ant , to lock out a fire tube , turn out to reverse a plate with a thylacine .
and sure , we would have these fire hydr@@ es all over time , and many people do that .
but these apps are like small digital memories that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers who pay taxes and receive taxes .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government until we improve government citizenship .
so the question that i have all of you here : if it comes to the big , important things we need to do together , all together , we &apos;re only going to be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
i mean , my role is to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies are going to be , and i thought , because i &apos;m standing here , i &apos;m going to tell you , and i thought , since i &apos;m here , i &apos;m going to tell you , and also trying to look at what &apos;s going on , and also trying to look at what &apos;s going on .
i &apos;m going to start with a single , boring slide .
now , let &apos;s just show the slide .
this is a slide i &apos;ve just selected from my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but in fact , the general shape .
this slide shows a design of the analysis of the analysis of risky processors with the power of a local area of ocean .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , like some other , which we often meet in our field , are a kind of a semi-@@ log curve .
in other words , every step here is equivalent to the power scale .
and this is a new one , that we need to use this guy scale to semi-@@ logarith@@ mic curves in the field of technology .
something very strange happens here .
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about .
so , if you want to make the light again .
something else , because i &apos;m going to draw a little bit on the paper here .
now , why do we draw in the technology at a semi-@@ logarith@@ mic curves ?
the reason , if i would draw it on a normal curve , where , say , this is the years here , so the timeline of a way , and this is a presence of the technology that i want to point to a graph , which is the graph .
they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say a transportation technology , then it would be very unfair to the semi-@@ logarith@@ mic scale , in the form of a flat line .
but if something like this happens , it changes the qualit@@ ative circumstances .
so if the transportation technology is going to continue as fast as the micro@@ process of technology , then we could go back to a taxi , and in 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
but not that fast .
that &apos;s never happened before in the history of technology , this kind of recur@@ si@@ v@@ em growth , which is where the scale has increased exponentially .
now , the question i want to ask you is , if you look at these exponential curves , you &apos;re not going to go forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything is going on forever and almost as fast as we go .
there are two options .
it &apos;s either going to be a classic curve like this , to something completely new , or it will happen here .
it &apos;s something like this .
now , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen .
it &apos;s that , it means that we &apos;re in the middle of a transition moment .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the past world to a new kind of world .
so the question i &apos;m going to ask you about , and i often think of myself , is like this new world ?
what &apos;s the new state that takes the world slowly ?
because the transition is very , very confusing by being in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , the future was in 2000 , and people were often talking about what would happen in 2000 .
now , we have a conference where people are talking about the future , and they realize that the future still lies in 2000 .
beyond that we don &apos;t .
so in other words , the future is gone every year since i was in this world .
i think the reason is that we realize that something is happening .
the transition is happening . we can feel it all .
and we know that there &apos;s just no sense at the moment of trying to look at 30 or 50 years into the future , because everything will be so different , that a simple high mission of what we now don &apos;t make sense .
now , i want to talk about what that might be , that transition that we are at the moment .
in order to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really don &apos;t have anything to do with technology or computers .
because i think to really understand this , we need to take a step back and look at it on a time scale .
and i want to look at this at the time scale of the earth .
i think the whole picture makes sense when you split it in some billion steps .
so , let &apos;s go back , and it was 2.5 billion years , and the earth was a big , sterile ball with lots of plastic chemicals .
now , if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , this is a pretty good picture of how they made it .
i also think there are theories that start to understand how everything started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simpli@@ fied story of what is , which is that at that time , small oil dro@@ bs were around , which had different kinds of revenues for chemicals .
some of these oil dro@@ ps contain a particular combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and grow up .
everybody that was , started sharing .
these little oil dro@@ ps were the most primitive cell form .
however , these oil dro@@ p@@ ors weren &apos;t about living in the world today , because every single one of them was just a small , random recipe of chemicals .
and every time it divided together , they have increased chemicals .
so every dro@@ drip was a little different .
in fact , the dro@@ p@@ s , which one for growth , had faster than others and integrated more and more chemicals from the outside and spread faster .
so these biases , to survive longer , and they increased in scale .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but it &apos;s more interesting , if these dro@@ p@@ ets were learned a trick on abstra@@ ction .
in any way that we don &apos;t really understand , we have the ability to learn to write information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , and in a certain chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , you have found in this wild , evolutionary way of finding a way that allowed them to write what they were , so that this information could be stored and copied .
the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information is going to store over the time of 2.5 billion years , where it was born .
in fact , the recipe for us is our genes , which is exactly the same code and the same writing .
and every living thing uses the exact same letter and the same code .
we are as far as we can write , just for the sake of purpose , in this code .
and i &apos;ve been here 100 micro@@ grams of a soft pulse , which i &apos;m trying to hold away in the airports of security sperm .
in this , it &apos;s -- what i &apos;ve done is , i took this code -- the code consists of normal letters , which we use to mimic -- and i wrote my business map in a piece of dna , and i wrote it 10 ^ 22 times .
so if somebody wants a hundred million copies of my business card , i have enough for everyone in this room and even for everybody in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was really a stranger , i would have written it to a virus and put it in the space .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the in@@ writing of dna was an interesting step .
and these cells made these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another , very interesting step , where things were completely different , and , in fact , these cells began to communicate and exchange information so that communities emerged from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you know that , but bacteria can actually replace their dna .
this is also the reason for example to increase antibiotics .
some bacteria have figured out how they can hold from penicillin and have this information with other bacteria into dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because the bacteria communicate with each other .
this communication now allowed the reason of communities that were in a certain sense in the same boat ; they were syner@@ ge@@ tic .
so they either survived , or they went together , and that meant that when a community was successful , all the individuals of the community have been repeated more frequently and better from evolution .
now , the over@@ step point is where these communities are so close to , that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community into a plate chain .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
at this point , we have multi-@@ cell@@ ular communities , communities of many different forms of cells , which combined as a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also a multi-@@ metric community .
we have a lot of cells that are no longer placed .
your skin cells are useless , muscle cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started developing , so that the level where evolution was happening , no longer the single cell , but the entire cell community that we call organism .
the next step now happened within these communities .
the cell communities began to abstract information again .
and they developed special structures that made nothing else to process information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the information system that these cell communities have built .
they started to train specialists in the community , special structures that were responsible for learning , understanding and capturing information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point , an individual -- learning now within the lifetime of a single organism , rather than this evolutionary time .
so , an organism , for example , could learn to eat a particular frustration , because she loved and made it sick , the last time he had eaten her .
now , this could happen in the lifetime of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years ago , because this information was evolutionary , it had to be learned by the individuals who died because of these meals , because these information processing structures weren &apos;t there yet .
so the nervous system has the evolutionary process with this particular information structure , because evolution could now be within an individual .
it could be within a contemporary learning context .
what happened then is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
as an example , the most subtle of the world &apos;s known version is the human language .
it &apos;s a very intriguing invention , if you think about it .
i have a very complicated , fuzzy and confused idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m going to give you some basic notes of me in the hope of creating a similar fake idea in your head , which has a certain resem@@ blance with my original idea .
so we &apos;re taking something very complicated , it turns into sound , a sequence of sound , and make something very complicated in the head of others .
so this allows us to work again as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we , the humanity , is , we started to abstract .
we go through the same stages that we &apos;ve been through -- the abstra@@ ction organisms -- the abstra@@ ction of our way we put data forward .
for example , the invention of language was a small step in this direction .
the telephone of computers , computers , video , c@@ d ro@@ ms , and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to handle this information .
and it all connects us together to something which is much bigger , and also able to move faster than we &apos;ve been .
so now evolution can happen in the time of micro@@ seconds .
you also saw t@@ ys little evolutionary examples of evolution , where he showed a bit of evolution in &quot; con@@ vol@@ lation &quot; program , right in front of your eyes .
so we &apos;ve re@@ graded the time time .
the first steps of the story that i told you about , a billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , gave a few hundred million years .
then the next steps , like language , and so forth , less than a million years ago .
and the next steps , like electronics , seem to take a few decades .
and the process feeds by itself , and it becomes , i think , car cataly@@ tic is the word for -- if something increases its velocity .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see in this explo@@ zed curve .
we see the process that feed itself .
i live living from building computers , and i know that i &apos;m using the mechanism that i use to build computers , not using computers , without the recently making progress in the computer technology .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible for me to design these in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor does in binary machine .
it has billions of them .
what i do instead of doing , and what the designers of thinking do is we think of a certain abstract level , which is the machine , and the machine makes something that goes beyond our capabilities , better and faster than we could ever do .
and it does it in part of the ways that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
one way that &apos;s interesting , which is particularly interesting , and which i used to use in the last time , is evolution itself .
this is an evolutionary process in the machine that &apos;s happening in the micro@@ second area .
in order to say , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that evolved from random in@@ instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , please get a hundred million randomly chosen sequences of in@@ instructions .
now , please take all of these random breeding instructions , all the programs take off , and then finally , for those of you who are the next . &quot;
so in other words , i define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to say , i want numbers , that would be a simple example i &apos;ve been using .
so , finding programs that can be used by the husbands .
and , of course , the chance of random breeding instructions is very small that at random numbers , they &apos;re just not going to be able to do that .
but one of them might be lucky to do two numbers in the right order .
now i &apos;m saying , &quot; computer , take the 10 percent of the sequences , which i gave my first purpose .
get this off , give them the rest .
now , all the remains that the numbers are going to be used to do .
it &apos;s with a method of re@@ connecting to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs , and they produce kids through the exchange of their su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ tin@@ les , and the kids are killing the properties of su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ les from the two programs .
so , i &apos;ve got a new generation of programs that emerged by combinations of programs that have come to the front of them as others .
tell , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
put it back .
perhaps run some mutations .
and try and do this again with another generation .
all these generations need very few milliseconds .
and so i can run a evolution over millions of years in the computer in less minutes , or more complicated situations .
after all , i get programs that can make numbers perfect .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i &apos;ve ever been able to write .
if i look at these programs , then i can &apos;t say how they work .
i &apos;ve tried to understand them .
it &apos;s denial and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know , i &apos;m sure they &apos;re doing the job , because they come from a series of thousands of programs that have done the job .
because their lives depend on whether they were doing the job right .
i used to sit in a 747 with mar@@ vin min@@ sky , he picks up a map and he says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
there it is , it &apos;s made of thousands of pieces , which work together to make your flight safer . &apos; does that not make you more reliable ? &quot;
we know that a process of development is not optimal when it becomes too complicated .
so we &apos;re starting to rely on computers for a process , which is very different from classical engineering .
he allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than the normal methods would allow us to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t really understand the possibilities of it .
so , that &apos;s what we think about the technology .
we use these programs now to make the computers much faster , so we can make these processes even faster .
so it creates a feedback feedback .
it gets faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so messy .
because all these new technologies today are feeding itself .
we pick up .
we &apos;re at a point , which is analog at the time , when species organisms have evolved to multi-@@ cellular organisms .
so we &apos;re the am@@ bs , and we can &apos;t really figure out what hell we &apos;re actually creating here .
we &apos;re in the middle of this point .
but i really think there &apos;s something else .
i think it &apos;s very subtle to say that we are the end product of evolution .
and i think we all here are part of the creation of what &apos;s going on next .
now , lunch is before , and i think i &apos;m going to hear here before i &apos;m going to cheat .
my story starts right here in ra@@ jas@@ than about two years ago .
i was underneath the star sky in the desert with su@@ fi@@ -@@ singer mu@@ ar ali .
we talked about that nothing has changed since the time of ancient indian era of mahab@@ har@@ ata . &quot;
when we were traveling by indians , we went into a car , and we went down to the sky .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
then , when the great indian warrior ar@@ jun@@ a used , he took a bow , pulled up into the floor and water .
now we do this with cor@@ ds and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic was replaced by machines .
that made me really sad .
i got a fear of technology .
i was afraid that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sun@@ set , without a camera and no tweet to my friends .
i found that technology should make magic and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the most magical thing for me .
it became a gulf access to a world full of pir@@ ate and contaminated ships and images in my imagination .
i thought it was like our fancy clo@@ cks and cameras to dream about it .
they kept us from being inspired .
and so , i gave myself to the world of technology to see how i could use it to use magic rather than kill .
at 16 , i began to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a piece of storytelling to connect readers around the world .
it can know how we think it is .
it can know where we are .
it takes pictures and text together , and animation , noise and touch .
storytelling used more senses .
but what do we do with it ?
i &apos;m just going to k@@ ho@@ ya , an interactive ipad app .
here &apos;s , &quot; put your finger on any light . &quot;
and so -- here says , &quot; this box belongs ... &quot; i write my name .
and i &apos;m going to show a character in the book .
and again , a letter goes down for me -- and the ipad knows by gps , where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
the kid in me is really excited about these possibilities .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean a magician and kite , but the magic of childhood , the ideas we all had as children .
fire@@ flies in a glass i always found quite exciting .
so you have to turn out the ipad and leave your fire@@ flies .
and the light the way through the rest of the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a kid is that a whole galaxy can be in a single mar@@ ar .
and this is why every book and every world is going to be a little mar@@ ble , which i &apos;m going to pull here to the magic device .
and this opens up a map .
imaginative books used to have maps , but these maps were static .
this map is growing and lighting and lighting to the rest of the book .
it also shows other places of the book .
i &apos;m going to go in here .
it &apos;s also important for me to make something that is in@@ ven@@ tic , but also very time .
this is the ap@@ sar@@ as .
we &apos;ve heard all the cattle and ny@@ pers , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the ap@@ sar@@ as ?
the poor ap@@ sar@@ as were caught thousands of years in in@@ dr@@ as kam@@ bers , in an old book book .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary history for kids .
a story that cuts with new issues , like the environmental crisis .
the environmental crisis , a big problem for the last 10 years , is that kids are sitting in their rooms , with their computers .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology .
in an interaction of the book , you send in a search , you have to go out , and you have to get out of the camera of the i@@ pads images of natural objects .
when i was a kid , i had collections of love , rocks , g@@ eins and shells .
somehow the kids don &apos;t make it .
this is a childhood ritual being brought back . you have to go out to make a picture from a flower and mark it .
in another chapter , you have to tag a piece of construction and tag and tag .
so you can actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can put online .
a kid in london shows the picture of a bro@@ ddle and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fu@@ ddle . &quot;
a kid in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey today . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of possibilities that we have to connect the world and technology .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning an interaction where you use the video of i@@ pads , and through augmented reality , you see an animation of el@@ ries that appear on a plant .
at one point , the screen is filled with leaves .
you have to make the sound sound , you remove bubbles and reading the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the nature of technology comes closer and closer in the magic and the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our kids and closer to the natural world and the magic , fun and the love of our childhood of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in research , prison or death cells .
i spend most of my time in the social building basin and places where there &apos;s plenty of hope .
to be here at ted , to see and hear how it &apos;s like that , i gave me a lot of power .
in the short time here , i realized that ted has an identity .
you can say things that have influence globally .
and sometimes , if something about ted comes , it gets a meaning and force that otherwise wouldn &apos;t .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a textbook have meaning , but the words of a committed textbook are particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i &apos;ve not learned this in my work as a lawyer .
i learned this from my grandmother .
i became large in a family , a traditional african-american household , who was dominated by a matri@@ arch , and this matri@@ arch was my grandmother .
she was a brick , strong woman , she had influence .
she had the last word in every family struggle .
it was also the origin of many differences in our family .
she was the daughter of slave family .
their parents were born in the 18@@ 40s in virginia as a slave .
it was born in 18@@ 80 , and the experience of slavery was very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met them as a young boy , she came to me and she got me .
she struck me so that i could barely breathe . then she made me go .
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came to me and she said , &quot; br@@ yan , do you feel my hug ? &quot;
and if i said &quot; no , &quot; she gave me back . if i said yes , she would leave me in quiet .
it was something that was made that you wanted to be close to it .
the only problem was that you had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes , when i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get their attention .
my cousins went around everywhere .
i remember eight or nine , i have to be eight or nine , that i went to one morning and i went into living rooms . all my cousins went around .
my grandmother was at the end of the room , and i was staring at me .
first , i thought that was a game .
i looked at her and smiles , but she looked very serious .
it went so 15 or 20 minutes . she stood up , and she came to me , and she took me . she took me , and she said , &quot; come on , br@@ yan . you and i , we need to talk . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me outside , and i said , &quot; br@@ yan , i &apos;ll tell you something , but you have to promise that you don &apos;t carry it . &quot;
i said , &quot; promised , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; my favorite word ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
and she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i saw you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
and then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise me three things , br@@ yan . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; well , first of all , i want you to always love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you have to promise that you &apos;re always going to take care of it . &quot;
i would say my mother , so i said , &quot; yeah , grandma , i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
then she said , &quot; the next thing i &apos;m going to say is that you &apos;re always going to do the right thing , &quot; if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
i thought , &quot; yeah , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
and finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you need to promise me is , &quot; you &apos;re never going to drink alcohol . &quot;
now , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yeah , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the land , in the old south , rural south , and i have a brother who is older , and a year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day , my brother came home , and i brought this 16-@@ piece beer , and i got my sister and me and went to the forest .
we just got bored there as well as otherwise .
then he took a drink and he offered my sister to one another , and she took me , and then she gave me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . all right . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , do it . now , you &apos;re doing whatever we do .
i had what , your sister had something . go , drink a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . you just do . you just do . &quot;
my brother kept staring at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? now , what do you do . &quot;
then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; oh , no , you don &apos;t always make you crazy because of the conversation with grandmother ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma tells everybody that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to give you something .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that .
this may be publicly transmitted publicly .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m willing i &apos;d never drink a drop of alcohol .
i don &apos;t say that because i think it &apos;s tu@@ eling . i say it &apos;s because identity does .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell the people around us that they don &apos;t believe .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would say all of their angels , they &apos;re special .
my grandfather was in the pro@@ hi@@ tion of prison .
my uncle died of alco@@ hol@@ induced diseases .
and it believed that this was the issues that we would have to take care of .
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our justice system .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 197@@ 2 , 300,000 people were in prison and in prison .
today it &apos;s 2.@@ 3 million .
the united states today has the highest incarcer@@ ation rate of the world .
seven million people are released in currency or un@@ condi@@ tional criminal .
and in my opinion , mass incarcer@@ ations have altered our world fundamentally .
in social and black parts of the population , the population of despair and hop@@ eless@@ ness , because of these changes .
one of three male black black babies between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , in denial , or in@@ condi@@ tional criminal .
in urban communities all around the country -- from los angeles of philadelphia , baltimore to washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all the black young men are either in prison , in prison , in prison , or un@@ condi@@ tional criminal .
our system will not just be shaped by questions that have to do with ras@@ n@@ city , it &apos;s also driven by poverty .
we have a justice system in this country that they treated much better when they &apos;re rich and guilty as poor and innocent .
wealth , not debt , affects the result .
however , we seem to be completely satisfied .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we have lost touch .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there are some interesting developments .
my home state of alabama is the equivalent of the election , which is the right thing to do .
here today , in alabama , 34 percent of the male population , they keep their voting right .
we predicted that in 10 years , the risk of the civil honor council is going to be as high as the return of the election rights act .
the silence is con@@ gest@@ ed .
i hire kids .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world being convicted of a hundred year-old children in prison .
in this country , there are kids for children living with no means of progress .
we have a lot of process running .
the only country in the world .
i put people in death cells .
the death issue is an interesting question .
we believe because , you know , the real question is that the real question is : does a man deserve to die for one of them ?
it &apos;s a very delicate question .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other point is not : did anybody earned death for a crime , but , did we deserve it ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the death death death is defined by error .
at nine people we &apos;ve been executed , one of them we &apos;ve been doing for innocent , which was ex@@ ased and lost from the death cell .
an amazing error rate . one of nine innocent .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never let anyone fly with an airplane , if for nine planes , to lift one .
but somehow we can do it from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
i talk about race and the question , if we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting , because i share my students , i &apos;m talking about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the time against the end of the construction of the world world war .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
but for the african-american americans in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many places , people were afraid of lyn@@ ch@@ mobs .
or bombs .
it was the fear of terror that was shaped their lives .
these older people now come to me and say , &quot; mr. , ste@@ ven@@ son , you &apos;re talking , you &apos;re holding talks . you tell people to stop saying that we have to do it for the first time in the history of our nation : after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell people that we grew up . &quot;
and after the terrorism , of course , the ras@@ stics and decades of the ras@@ si@@ stic motiv@@ ated and apartheid .
and yet , in our country , there &apos;s a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what makes meaning in the historical context .
we &apos;re constantly chasing each other .
we create new ten@@ ten@@ sions and conflicts .
it &apos;s hard to talk about talking about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the law@@ ment isn &apos;t going to be overcome without the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there was this willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve been holding some talks in germany .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk , and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing to hear . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death .
and of course , it can never give them to germany . &quot;
it was very silent , and then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible we &apos;ve ever been talking to the alternative of people .
it would be to be aware of us , consciously and contra@@ cting people . &quot;
i thought about it .
how it would feel to live in a world where the german state made people working , especially if there was a lot of jews .
it would be unacceptable .
it would be happening .
and yet , in this country , in the state of the old south , we set people -- here &apos;s the risk of being convicted of death , 11 times higher , when the victim is black , when it &apos;s black . 22 times higher , in the same state , in the same state , when the body is black , and the victim knows , in the same state , where the body is in charge of people .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental feedback .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with these difficult issues , then the positive and wonderful things are also affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but eventually , these realities will be over@@ covered by suffering , abuse , denial , release .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
because what we &apos;re talking about is that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment to build in a complex world .
for me , the time to try to think and talk about the poor , the dis@@ charged , that never will be at ted .
but think about a way that is integrated into our own lives .
we all need to think about the end things we can &apos;t see .
we do that . we &apos;re also rational , so we value ourselves .
innovation , creativity , and development don &apos;t just come from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s this head@@ heart connection , which i think drives us , not just to be open to all the light and exciting things , but also for the dark and problematic .
vac@@ la@@ v ha@@ hn , the great che@@ ech@@ ic politician , once said .
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe , we wanted to make everything possible , but what we needed most was hope , a mental orientation , the willingness to be sometimes in hopeless places , to be witness . &quot;
this mental orientation is the core of what i think the ted communities must be involved in .
there &apos;s no evidence of technology and design that allows us to be completely human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , plus and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity takes a lot more of us than if we don &apos;t care about it .
she &apos;s going to touch it deeply .
as a young lawyer , i met the great privilege to meet pink parks .
and i used to go back to mont@@ gom@@ ery , where you &apos;re going to go back to mont@@ gom@@ ery , where you &apos;re going to do two of your oldest friends , you &apos;re never going to get these older women who had organized mont@@ gom@@ er@@ y bus@@ ro@@ t -- an incredible african-american -- and virginia dur@@ r , dr. king lovins .
so these women met , and they just turned out .
and then , to called this woman car@@ r , and i said , &quot; br@@ yan , lady parks comes into the city . we want to talk .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , really like . &quot;
and she said , &quot; and what do you do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and i just heard .
it was so inspiring , it was so inspiring .
i was sitting there one day , and i heard these women , and after a few hours , lady parks turned to me , and he said , &quot; br@@ yan , tell me what &apos;s the initiative of the road . &quot;
what do you try to achieve ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go to injustice .
w@@ r want people to help be innocent .
we want to fight prejudice and discrimin@@ ation in the criminal justice system .
we want to get habitats for life without a transformative cure for kids .
we want some against the death company .
we want to lower the number of branches .
we want to get mass tickets . &quot;
i was holding my usual talk , and then she looked at me , and i said , &quot; m@@ hmm . m@@ hmm . &quot;
she said , &quot; it &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
then , m@@ s. car@@ r , to me , put a finger on my face , and he said , &quot; and therefore , you have to be very , very brave . &quot;
and so i think the ted community should be ta@@ y .
we need to make ways . we need to ask these challenges : these problems , that sorry .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity .
i learned very simple things in my work .
i learned a few very simple things .
we all are more than the worst we &apos;ve ever done .
i think it &apos;s true for everybody on the planet .
if somebody is lying , he &apos;s not just a liar .
if somebody takes something he &apos;s not hearing , he &apos;s not just a thriving .
even who kills somebody , is not just a mur@@ derer .
and because this is , there &apos;s a fundamental human dignity to respect the law .
i also think in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think so .
i think in many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i think that even though it &apos;s so dramatic , it &apos;s so beautiful and inspiring , and so stimulating , we &apos;re not going to end up being measured by our technology , not the things we design , not our intellect and minds .
and finally , a society will not be measured by how they treated their rich and powerful and privileged , but about how they deal with the poor , the refused to prison .
because in this context , we &apos;re only beginning to figure out what &apos;s really amazing to us .
sometimes i lose the balance . i &apos;ll end with a story .
sometimes i hate too much .
i &apos;m going to get tired of how we all .
sometimes these ideas go ahead of our thinking , in very important ways .
i contacted these kids who were convicted too badly .
i go to the study prison , and i &apos;m going to go to a client who might be 13 or 14 years old , and that &apos;s supposed to be an adult in court .
then i wonder : how could this happen ?
how can a judge turn somebody into something he &apos;s not ?
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a kid .
one night , i stayed up too long , and i thought , my god , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he must have magic forces .
right , br@@ yan , the judge has magic forces .
you should also wish that .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think really well , i started working on a recovery .
i had a 14@@ -year-old , poor black boy as clients .
and i started to deal with this revenue , and the headline was : &quot; increase , my arms , 14 years of black students like a privileged , white , 7@@ 5@@ -year-old top@@ managers . &quot;
in my pace , i explained that failure is the state of the state and the police and the police .
there was a crazy line about that in this country , there &apos;s nothing more like that in this country .
so the next morning , i woke up , and i didn &apos;t know if i was just dreaming of this crazy speed or writing him .
and i didn &apos;t just write it , i didn &apos;t just write it .
a few months ago , and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go to the court and i have this crazy case .
i went down to the car , and i was really overwhelmed .
so i went to court .
and i thought , it &apos;s so hard , so painful .
i ended up from my car , and i went up the stairs to the court .
when i wake up the stairs , it was an elderly , black man , the janit@@ ors in the court .
when he saw me , he came to me and he said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and send me .
then he went to the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power .
it touched something very deep in me , identity , the ability for each one to contribute to a community , to a perspective of hope .
well , i went to the court hall .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. ste@@ ven@@ son , did you put this crazy one ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yeah . &quot; and then we started discussing .
more people came in , just because they were mad .
i had written these crazy things .
police officers were coming in and he was leading states and office workers .
in the hand , the court of people who were angry was that we were talking about skin skin language , about poverty , about inequality .
from my eye , i saw the janit@@ ors and go off .
he used to see through the window , and he could hear all the to@@ hu@@ w@@ beans .
he went up and down .
after all , this older black man came in with a very charming face in the court hall , and immediately sat behind me , almost on the defense bank .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a pause .
and during the break , a police officer came in , who was delighted by the janit@@ ors in the court room .
this de@@ p ran over to the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the cour@@ ard ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he looked at the de@@ pu@@ ty , then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come to say , &quot; i &apos;ve come to tell this young man , don &apos;t leave the target . &quot;
i &apos;ve come to the ted , because i think many of them have understood that the moral pen@@ del of the universe is going to take place , but it &apos;s justice .
that we &apos;re not completely developed as humans unless we care about human rights and value .
that all of our survival is connected to each other .
that we need to connect our visions of technology and design , from entertainment and creativity to humanity , pity and justice .
and most of all , i would like to share with those of you who just see this , just say , don &apos;t lose the target . don &apos;t give up .
they have seen in this audience , this community , an obvious wish , and heard to help and do something .
what else can we do ?
br@@ yan ste@@ ven@@ son : well , there &apos;s opportunity everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a dictionary in this spring where it &apos;s actually about making a effort to turn something out of the power stream , which goes into the politics of punishment .
here , california , for example , is going to be a billion dollars in the next five years . one billion dollars .
and yet , in the end of 46 percent of all the wages , they don &apos;t have a handle .
56 percent of all ra@@ stic@@ ings don &apos;t come from court .
this is the opportunity to do something .
this is a point that will suggest to invest money in more security force and safety .
i think there &apos;s opportunity everywhere .
over the last three decades , the crime rate has dropped enormously .
this is often being put into a context with increased predators .
what would you say to somebody who believes that ?
now , in fact , the number of violent crime has not changed .
most of the mass incarcer@@ ations in this country didn &apos;t really occur in the class of nonviolent nonviolent .
it was the mis@@ placed crossing against drugs .
that &apos;s why the dramatic high numbers come in the prison .
we &apos;ve gone away from the rhetoric of the rhetoric .
now , we &apos;ve got &quot; three-dimensional &quot; laws , which people get behind the grid , for a bicycle department , for a bicycle department , for the theft of a good good , rather than that you &apos;re going to affect the sacrifice .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become victims of shelter , not less .
and i think that we don &apos;t have to help anyone .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
br@@ yan , you &apos;ve really got a swing here .
it &apos;s an inspiring personality .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
bin death is an increased risk .
famine in somalia : famine in somalia .
wh@@ 4 : malig@@ -like car@@ tel@@ s .
it &apos;s more : more social . speaker : 65 dead .
tsunami : terri@@ am@@ i@@ warning . speakers : cyber attacks .
different speakers : drug war . mass weapons . tornado .
recession . ra@@ om@@ s@@ day . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so this is just a few clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it could be the last six days , or the last six years .
in fact , the media is willing to show us to show negative topics , because our minds are paying attention to these topics .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for this .
every second every single day , our senses will start with much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because of us , nothing more important is than our survival is the first stop for all of our temporal lobe , the amy@@ g@@ d@@ ala .
so the amy@@ g@@ d@@ ala is our early warning system , our risk detector .
it gets sor@@ ted , and it passes all the information on the quest for any threat in our environment .
so when we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old saying , &quot; if it gets blood , the demand is very true . &quot;
now , with all our digital devices that are going to allow us seven days a week to put all of these negative messages , it &apos;s not a miracle that we are pessimi@@ stic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks it &apos;s always worse .
but perhaps that &apos;s not the case .
perhaps that &apos;s the reality .
perhaps the enormous amount of progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century is a series of forces , so strong that it &apos;s possible to create a world of excess .
now , i &apos;m not saying we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate change , species die , water and energy problems -- we &apos;ve got that .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at looking at problems in a very long term , but they eventually end up being through .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can predict the development .
in the last 100 years , average life expectancy has doubled more than doubled to average average average of the world &apos;s population has tri@@ pled .
child mortality has a tenth .
it comes to the fact that food , electrical transportation and communication and communication costs have been more ambiguous .
steve pinker showed us we &apos;re living in a very peaceful time of human history .
and charles ken@@ ny , according to literacy , is up to the 80 percent in the last 130 years .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we &apos;re increasing our expectations all the time .
in fact , we re@@ defined poverty .
think that a large percentage of americans who live below the poverty line , access to current , water , toilets , refriger@@ ators , television , mobile phones , the climate phone and cars .
the richest capit@@ alists of the last century , the empires of the earth , would never have been able to dream of luxury goods .
the basis of a lot of these are technologies , and they &apos;re growing out of it .
my great friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that will become information technology , on the verge of moore &apos;s law , makes great jumps , and the price performance is doubling every 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs about a million times less , and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law for the last hundred years .
notice two things at this curve .
one , how smooth it is going on -- in good like bad times , war or peace , recession , depression and high con@@ figu@@ cture .
this is the result of faster computers building faster computers .
it &apos;s slowed down for none of our big problems .
and also , despite your logarith@@ mic impact on the left , it goes up@@ wards .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this graph , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies all available .
&quot; cloud computing , &quot; something that my friends call auto@@ desk , &quot; sensors and networks , &quot; sensors and networks , robots , 3d printers , which allow them to democra@@ tize personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , vaccine and food , digital medicine , nano-@@ materials and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the victory of ibm &apos;s supercomputer in &quot; risk &quot; ?
that was the big one .
i went through the newspapers , looking for the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson forces human enemies . &quot;
risk is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nu@@ ances of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence is available to every owner of a mobile phone .
four years ago , i launched ray kurzweil , and i here at ted a new university called singularity university .
we bring our students to all these technologies , with special focus on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year , we &apos;re asking the students to create products , products and services , which within a decade , can be able to live the lives of billions of people .
think that a group of students today can influence the lives of billions of people .
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
today , we can go to dozens of companies that have done exactly this .
when i think abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for anyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about making a life full of possibilities .
it &apos;s about making abundance out of scarce goods .
scarcity is because of the technology , and technology is an resources of resources .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of na@@ po@@ le@@ on i@@ i@@ ani in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of si@@ an to dinner .
na@@ po@@ le@@ on soldiers got silver bribe , na@@ po@@ le@@ on himself got gol@@ d-@@ tu@@ ck .
the king of si@@ des got aluminum tu@@ ck .
aluminum , at this time , the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and grasses .
now , this is the reason the dome of the cour@@ ing@@ ton je@@ lt was made of aluminum .
although aluminum takes to 8.@@ 3 percent of the mass mass , it doesn &apos;t happen as pure metal .
it &apos;s being connected by oxygen and biotechnology .
but then the technology of the electro@@ ly@@ sis was developed and made aluminum production so cheap that we use it with our path mentality .
then let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
we think about energy scarcity today .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet that &apos;s filled with more energy than we consume every year .
16 ter@@ a@@ watts energy , all 93 minutes on earth .
it &apos;s not scarcity , the problem is accessible .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve been able to reduce the cost of solar power in india to 50 percent of the toxic stream -- 8,@@ 8 rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost for solar energy dropped by 50 percent .
last month , this published with a study that shows that up to the end of this decade in the sunny areas of the u.s. solar is 6 cents per root , in comparison to 15 cents in the national average .
and if we have a lot of energy , we &apos;ll also have water in abundance .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
remember , when carl sa@@ gan , in 1990 , when it was moved by saturn , it turned back to earth ?
he took a famous photo . what was it ?
&quot; a census blue dot . &quot;
because we live on a water planet .
we live on a planet that &apos;s covered to 70 percent water .
yes , it &apos;s 9@@ 7.@@ 5 percent of water , two percent , and we &apos;re fighting 0.@@ 5 percent of water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there are new technologies , not 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new mobility on the way , nano-@@ materials .
and from a conversation today with dean ka@@ man , one of the innovators of the do self , i &apos;d like to share with you -- he gave me to share with you -- he gave me permission -- his techno@@ gy , the &quot; sl@@ ing@@ shot , &quot; which is , you know , the size of a refrigerator in student .
it can produce a thousand gallons of clean water a day from different sources -- whether salt , pollu@@ ted water , latrine -- and all this for less than two cents per gallon .
the president of coca-cola has just agreed to start a big test project with a hundred units of the developing world .
and if everything goes fine , and i &apos;m very hopeful , then coca-cola will apply this technology globally in 20@@ 6 countries around the planet .
this is technology support innovation that we have today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones as well .
you know , we &apos;re going to reach the 70 percent increase of mobile phones in developing countries to the end of 20@@ 13 .
just think that a ma@@ ma@@ i warrior with a cellphone in the middle of kenya has a better mobile communication , as president reagan was 25 years ago .
and if you look for google on google , you have more access to knowledge and information as president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in abundance , such as no one could ever have predicted .
and it &apos;s even better , the things that you and i spent several thousand dollars spent -- gps , h@@ d video and photograph , libraries of books and music , the technology of the medical diagnostic -- are now being transformed and cheaper in your cell phone .
and the best part of this is perhaps what &apos;s expected to be in health .
last month , i had the pleasure with the quality foundation , which is called &quot; $ 10 million risk tri@@ cor@@ m tri@@ cor@@ m . &quot;
we challenge teams around the world to connect all of these technologies into a mobile phone , that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s equipped with ai , and you can test your blood .
and to win , the device has to diagnose a better diagnosis than a team of highly skilled physicians .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease burden and 1.3 percent of the staff of healthcare .
if this device sequenced a mining or a dna virus that &apos;s not known , it calls the health century and prevents a pandemic in front of it .
but now the biggest force that will lead us to a world of excess .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines stand for population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the seven-@@ billion brand .
and only by the way , the biggest decline against a population explosion is better education and food throughout the world .
in 2010 , we were dealing with two billion people online .
by 2020 , we rise from two billion internet users .
three billion new minds , which we &apos;ve never heard before , will join the global communication .
what do these people need ?
what will they consume ? what will they want ?
and instead of economic gridlock , i see one of the greatest economic supplies of the story .
these people represent multiple trillion dollars in the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to become healthier using the use of the tri@@ co@@ ary , and they &apos;re going to be trained by the khan academy , and by being able to use the opportunity to use 3d printers and to be more productive than ever before .
so what can we bring to three billion growing , healthy , educated members of the human community ?
how would it be with a sentence of new , never heard before .
how would it be , the op@@ pressed , wherever you are , to give a voice to make sense and create change , for the first time ?
what will these three billion people bring ?
how would it be with subjects that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things i learned through the x prize is that small teams that are motivated by passion and focus can create extraordinary things , things that could only create large companies and governments only in the past .
i want to finish with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that some might know .
it &apos;s a game called fol@@ dit .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein will evolve .
and according to his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in medical research .
now this is a problem for supercomputer .
and this is a game that was played by university professors and so on .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people playing the game online .
and it showed that now the human pattern recognition is better the proteins than the best supercomputer .
and when those people came and looked at who &apos;s the best standard of the world , this was not an mit professor , it was not a cal@@ tech student , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who worked during the day as an assistant in the day , and was the best standard of the world .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me trust in our future is the fact that we have more power than individuals to bring us to the big challenges of the planet .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a di@@ tian innovators .
we have the capital of tech@@ no-@@ philanthropy .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work on online to address the new challenges , and to do what &apos;s required .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to do something against a transformative piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical age , and that &apos;s me .
and maybe i &apos;m a long time in business , that i can give it to a piece of my own fake fake .
before i come to the actual subject of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we are close to seasonal , and we move to the world champion@@ ship .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; mon@@ ey@@ ball &quot; seems to be the statistics , and it &apos;s about statistics , and to use those to use a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to get to a statistics that i hope most of you have heard of .
it &apos;s the average performance of the baby .
we &apos;re talking about 300 , when a bat hits 300 .
that means that the player is definitely three of 10 beats .
that &apos;s what the ball means in the outdoor field , he comes up , he &apos;s not caught , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball to the first base , hasn &apos;t done it in time , and the bar was in safety .
three out of 10 .
do you know how to call a 3@@ 00@@ ter in central foreign baseball ?
okay , really good , perhaps a star star .
you know how to call a 4@@ 00@@ ter ?
this is somebody who is safe at the rest of 10 .
legendary -- like ted williams legendary , the last major foreign baseball player met during a regular season over 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , where i &apos;m going to feel a lot of well-being or maybe a bit less likely to talk about it .
suppose you &apos;ve got a blind ou@@ po@@ il , and you &apos;ll get to an oscar cursor , which is an average performance 400 in terms of resistance .
it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine if you live in a certain remote area , and you &apos;ve got a loved person with clo@@ gged heart disease , and your home doctor gives you this to a cardi@@ ologist whose average performance at the base of 200 is 200 .
but , you know what ?
it &apos;s much better this year . it &apos;s on top of it .
and she &apos;s touching a 25@@ 7 .
it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think the average performance for a car@@ di@@ ologist or a nurse or an orthop@@ um , an a@@ ater , should be a rescue ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that no one in the whole medicine knows what should be a great surgeon or a doctor or a rescue .
however , what we do , though , is that every one of them , including me , is to send out to the world to be perfect .
never make a mistake , no one makes a mistake of the details of how this should be done .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
i was a compul@@ xic student .
in high school , an undergraduate student said that brian gold@@ man would learn for a blood test .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little bra@@ ck in my little roof , in the weekends , in the toronto , a general hospital , un@@ far from here .
i learned everything .
in my anatom@@ y-@@ class , i learned the origins and exit every muscle , every branch of any artery , which is taking away from the aorta , ob@@ tains and ordinary differential diagnostics .
i even knew the differential diagnosis to classi@@ fy ren@@ al tu@@ bu@@ ines .
and the whole time i got more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i went off with c@@ um .
and i left the medical study with the impression that i knew everything , if i knew everything , or everything , or at least as much as possible , as close to everything as possible , that i was immune to the power of mistake .
and it worked for a while until i met a printer .
i &apos;m resistant to an education hospital in toronto in the middle of the hospital , and i was being brought into the emergency hospital .
at this point , i was the kar@@ gic layer in the kar@@ gic service .
and it was my mission , as the emergency community car@@ di@@ ological advice , to study patients .
giving feedback to my top doctor .
i studied the machine , and she was in breathing distress .
and when i listened to her , she made clubs .
and when i heard her breast with the stetho@@ sc@@ es , i was able to hear a cracked of the sound on both sides , telling me that it was under con@@ gest@@ able heart failure .
this is a state where the heart is failing , instead of pump@@ ing the entire blood on , a part of the blood is stuck in your lungs and filling it up , and that &apos;s where the odds came from .
and that was not hard to diagnose .
i hired it and went to the treatment .
i gave her an album . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call di@@ us@@ re@@ tics , the water , so that they broke out the liquid .
and over a year from a year to two hours , they started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent it home .
i actually made two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my top doctor .
i didn &apos;t take the bow , and i was doing what i should have said , what would be a call in my high doctor , so that he would have had a chance to make a chance .
and he knew it , he would have been able to control information .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the aid doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i was so able to take care of my patients without having to contact him .
my second mistake was worse .
so that i sent her home , i didn &apos;t write a voice in me who was trying to say , &quot; telescopes , no good idea . don &apos;t do this . &quot;
in fact , i was missing so much for confident that i asked the nurse to take care of the lady , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay when you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and he said , &quot; yeah , i think it will go fine . &quot;
i remember it as being yesterday .
so i ended up making the re@@ cursor and a hospital and rescue and rescue them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , i had this idea of feeling in my stomach .
but i kept working .
and by the end of the day , i grabbed my things , followed the hospital , and went to a parking lot to drive the car when i did something i didn &apos;t .
i went home from the emergency emergency department .
and there was another nurse , not the nurse who saw the woman &apos;s printer , but another three words to me , and those three words fear the most emergency doctors i know .
other medical doctors fear these same , but the emergency care medicine is very special , because we just see the patients .
the three words loud : remember ?
&quot; remember the patients they made home ? &quot;
asked the nurse .
&quot; she &apos;s back , &quot; she said , &quot; she said in this particular scale .
so she was back .
she was back and dying .
it was about an hour where she was going home after i was traveling home , and the family was called 9@@ 11 , and the family would call them 9@@ 11 , and the rescue , they took it back to the emergency station , which is a dangerous shock .
she was barely breathing , and it was blue .
the emergency staff took all the strands .
they increased their blood pressure .
they put them on the breathing machine .
i was shocked . i was shocked .
and i was living through this roll@@ er@@ way , because after the stabili@@ tion of the intensive care , i was hoping she would recover .
and after two , three days , they realized that she would never go again .
she had not suffered a failed brain .
their family gathered .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they gave birth to that .
the new day , they were going to walk them -- woman printer , a woman , mother and grandmother .
you say , the names of those who die never forget .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
so the next couple of weeks , i made myself , and i found myself , for the first time , the un@@ healthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself alone , not the kind of healthy shame that you can feel because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues .
you all know the healthy shame , if you have a secret of the best friend prize , and you &apos;re going to get a sense of the best friend , and you get caught , and you &apos;re going to get the best friend on it , and i &apos;m going to take the best friend in it , and i &apos;m going to take a terrible discussion , and you can never make a mistake like that .
if you make re@@ fine , and the mistake never makes again .
this is the kind of educational shame .
the im@@ healthy way i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes one in the mind .
it &apos;s the one who tells you not what you &apos;re doing , but you &apos;re bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my chief , he was very dear .
he spoke to the family , and i &apos;m sure he was going to get the wo@@ g glass and sure i was not going to beat .
but i continued to ask these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the top doctor ? why would i get it home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make a dumb mistake ?
why did i get into medicine ?
slowly , it was safe .
i started feeling better .
and then one day , one day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke , and i could feel better again .
and i was talking to myself that if i was growing my efforts to perfe@@ ction , and never again a mistake that the voice could get upset .
and she did .
and i kept working on .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the emergency emergency hospital in a community hospital north of toronto , and i was interviewing a 25 year-old man with spon@@ te .
it was a lot , and i was in a hurry .
he always showed here .
i looked in the bow , and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a contest for penicillin and sent him on .
and when he went out of the door , he showed his ra@@ ck .
two days later , i came to my next asset , and my che@@ dy@@ ess asked me to talk to her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient ? &quot;
it turns out he &apos;s a straig@@ pto@@ co@@ ck infection .
he had a potentially life-@@ dangerous disease called grace .
you can google , but it &apos;s not infection of the radar , but it &apos;s the upper breathing , and it causes the end of the breath .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
he got intra@@ v@@ ous anti-@@ bo@@ tica and went a few days later .
and i went back through the same tor@@ tu@@ ome of shame and self-@@ doubt , felt me and went to work until again and again and again .
in an emergency layer , i &apos;ve been missing a blind error .
there &apos;s a lot of it , especially if you think you &apos;re working in a hospital that was only 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and i didn &apos;t have a man in their treatment either .
one , i thought he would have kidney stones .
i propose the x-ray of the kidney . when this was not a fund , my colleague , in the re@@ mission of the patient , stuck in a lower right place , and called the oper@@ os .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
i plan to re@@ pel him , and i asked my colleagues to evaluate him as well .
and that &apos;s what he did , and he made a breakthrough in the right lower sector , he called the oper@@ os .
in both cases , it was ai@@ eri@@ ed , and it was fine .
both of them got me , ask me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened only in the first five years , which is a lot of my colleagues , but it &apos;s completely nonsense .
some of my blade happened in the last five years .
alone , shame and no support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t close with my mistakes and talk about them , if i &apos;m the silent voice that tells me what really wasn &apos;t happening , how do i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my mistakes so they don &apos;t do the same ?
if i was in a room -- like now , i have no idea what you think about me .
when did you hear the last time of someone who &apos;s been talking about failure on failure ?
oh yes , you go to a cocktail party , and you may hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about your mistakes .
if i was in a room full of colleagues , and to tell her immediate support , and to tell them , what i just told you , i would not be able to tell you the end of the second story , before it really would take you to the end of the second story , and you &apos;d forget the rest of them .
and in fact , if i knew my colleagues , that an orthop@@ n@@ de in my hospital would have taken someone the wrong leg , then you think i would have trouble looking at him .
this is the system we live in .
it &apos;s a completely denial of errors .
it &apos;s a system where there are two fundamental positions -- the ones that make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do it . those who don &apos;t do it . the ones that are falling with the bad results and the good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological response like antibodies to attack people .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we make the people who are making mistakes out of medicine , we have a secure system .
but there are two problems .
in my about 20 years of the treatment of journalism , and journalism , i &apos;ve created a personal medical study about medical error and wrong treatments , so all of my first article for one of my first articles that i &apos;m doing for the toronto star , which is &quot; white silent , black way . &quot;
and what i learned is that errors are absolutely in@@ animate .
we &apos;re working in a system where we &apos;re going to do every single day in which one of 10 medi@@ ors is either false or wrong , in the hospital infections always will cause and will cause deva@@ station or the dead .
in this state , about 24@@ ,000 canadi@@ ans are dying of more targeted mistakes .
in the united states , the institute for medicine is at 100,000 .
both of them are strong sub@@ gases , because we don &apos;t think about the problem as we should .
and it &apos;s the cru@@ x .
in a hospital system , the medical knowledge is doubling every two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up .
deprivation is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive error , so we can take a perfect disease for a patient with breast pain .
and then i &apos;ll take the same patient with breast pain , and i &apos;m going to take it off and give it to a very easily alco@@ ho@@ zed breath , and suddenly , the story is through contemp@@ t .
i don &apos;t take the same line .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always make things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms always in the same way .
all of these things are inevitable .
so , if you take the system , as i &apos;ve been taught , and all the faul@@ sed health care care , then no one &apos;s left .
and you know the lighter about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , &quot; white triumph , black style , &quot; i have the habit to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; and i would say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; and i would say , &quot; this is my worst mistake . &quot;
and then their pu@@ pills expand , they &apos;re in front of the head , then they look down and they &apos;re hard to tell and start telling their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
you want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistake that i make . &quot;
what you need is an environment that you put in it .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new defining doctor is a man , know about his humanity , accepted it , is not proud of making mistakes , but it &apos;s all going to learn to learn anything to be passed on .
they share their experiences with others .
they support the other from their mistakes .
and it shows other their mistakes , not to put on , but in a loving , supportive way of all benefit .
and it &apos;s working in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life , and if this is , people also make mistakes from time to time .
so that the system is developing the line , which can make it easier to make mistakes that make people inevitable , and it &apos;s also allowing us to create a support of support spaces where anyone who &apos;s looking at the health care , and it can actually predict things for people like me who are going to be able to make the mistakes and make this reward .
my name is brian gilbert .
i &apos;m the re@@ defined doctor .
i &apos;m a person . i &apos;m making mistakes .
i &apos;m sitting . but i &apos;m trying to learn to be able to learn from it to allow others .
i don &apos;t realize what they hold from me , but i can live .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , small idea .
it &apos;s about transformational biomass .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you about three stories to use the time .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he was in 18@@ 35 .
you might think he was flashing , but that &apos;s not true .
he actually gathered fish .
he described one of them as &quot; usual . &quot;
it was a cockroach .
up to the &apos; 80s , it was pushed in great style .
now he &apos;s in the red list .
this is the story that we &apos;ve heard many times from the galapagos , or from other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet , we still get into the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the bro@@ ddle still describe it as un@@ touched .
what &apos;s happened here ?
the second story is supposed to be a different concept , the transformative ta@@ il@@ age .
because i experienced it when i was in 1971 a la@@ go@@ n in west africa .
i went there , because i grew up in europe , and i wanted to work later in africa .
i thought i could integrate .
and i got a terrible sun@@ fire , and i was convinced i was really not .
it was my first sun@@ fire .
and as you can see , the la@@ go@@ et of pal@@ ms and a few mangro@@ ves were rejected .
there were l@@ t@@ bar@@ sche of about 20 inches , black shark nails , a sub@@ kind of colorful .
the number of reasons of these bun@@ c@@ ene were very , very sophisticated , and the fishermen lived well in ghana .
when i returned 27 years later , the fish was gone to the half of its size .
they grow five centimeters .
they were genetic .
it was still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish also had the privilege of being there .
so it changed nothing , and yet everything changed .
my third little story tells me about what i was doing in the introduction of fisheries in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s , more at the beginning of the 60s -- europe has a lot of developmental projects .
fishing production meant countries that have already started hundreds of fish , the industrial fishing catch of this very ugly ship called ten@@ ara 4 .
i went to it , and we went across the southern southern ocean , especially in ja@@ vas@@ ee .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
i know now that it was the bottom of the ocean .
90 percent of our fan@@ gs were weak@@ ous , other animals that are connected to the reason .
the biggest part of the fish , the small dots there , on the tru@@ ddle , was the dri@@ ddle of coral reefs .
essentially , the bottom of the ocean came to the deck , and then went back .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition is very fast .
within a year , you take a survey , and then you start with the commercial fisheries .
the reason is changing . it &apos;s in this case -- in this case , a very hard reason , or soft corals will be mat@@ ed .
this is a dead turtle .
they weren &apos;t eaten , they threw them away , because they were dead .
once we started a living .
she hasn &apos;t been blowing .
then they wanted to kill them , because they were able to eat them .
in fact , this mountain of race will collect from fishermen every time they drive in areas where they &apos;ve never been fishermen .
it &apos;s not being documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we fit our empires to the new level , and we don &apos;t have a reminder of what was there .
if you gener@@ alize it , this is what happens .
on the y-@@ axis , a few good things : bio@@ diversity , number of the or@@ ca , the green of their country , the water supply .
over time , it changes . it changes , because for people , they &apos;re completely natural .
every generation is looking at the images that you &apos;re looking at at the beginning of your conscious life , as standard and will take everything off .
the difference then becomes a loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
there can be a sequence of change .
and , in the end , they just want to get the default remains .
now , this is exactly what our goal is .
we want to preserve things that are gone or things that are not more like they were .
you could think that the problem is people , that certainly , when they were living in predators societies , animals killed , and they were expected by a few generations of what they did .
because obviously , a animal becomes a very common animal , except before it dies .
so you don &apos;t lose animals often .
you always lose rare animals .
and therefore it &apos;s not going to be a big loss .
at the time , we &apos;re focusing on the large animals , and the ocean is the big fish .
they &apos;re rare because we &apos;re beginning .
over time , there &apos;s a little fish on time , and we think that &apos;s the default value .
the question is why people accept that .
well , because they don &apos;t know it was different .
of course , many people , scientists , suggest it was really different .
you will confirm it , because the evidence , as they were in a former form , are not the way they would like to be .
so , for example , the anec@@ dote that the report of a captain &apos;s report is not being used in this area , can &apos;t be used by fishing , or fishing scientists don &apos;t usually be trading , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enormous big role to play a marine protected area .
because in terms of marine reserves , we basically have the past again .
we re@@ frame the past that people can &apos;t understand because the empires are changing and very low .
so , the people who can see a marine protected and benefit from the insight that allows them to return their reproductive values .
what about the people that aren &apos;t possible because they don &apos;t have access -- the people in the middle west for example ?
here , i think the art and the film might fill up the gap , and simulation .
this is the simulation of ches@@ ape@@ a@@ ke bay .
a long time ago , there was gray whales -- 500 years ago .
and you might remember the color sounds and you might remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were being touched by this -- except from the po@@ ca@@ hon@@ s story , why were they so touched by the picture of the picture ?
because it says something that has been lost in a way .
so my recommen@@ ction , the only one i &apos;m going to give you , is in cameron , so he &apos;s turning &quot; avatar ii . &quot;
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in the communist eastern germany , you had to know , if you had a writing machine , you had to register it in the government .
they also had to register a sheet with an unprecedented text machine .
the reason for this : the government could track where a text came from .
found an article with fine thought , you could find the creators of this thought .
and in the west , we couldn &apos;t understand how anyone could do something like this , and how much that would limit the freedom of freedom .
in our own countries , we would never do anything like this .
but if you can buy a new color printer in 2011 , the leading laser printer from the leading laser printing , and you print a page , and then you print this page bright yellow spot on each page , in a pattern that makes the site clear to them and re@@ trace their printer .
this is what &apos;s happening today .
and no one seems to rain .
and this was an example of what our own governments are doing against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the three main sources of the existing problems today .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can split the attacks in categories .
we have three main groups .
there are online criminals .
for example , this is mr. dimit@@ ry gol@@ san dress from g@@ v in ukra@@ ine .
and the foundations of online criminal are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use online attacks to make a lot of money , a huge amount of money .
there are several known cases of online million@@ ene , multi-@@ million-@@ million-@@ million that made their money through attacks .
this is w@@ la@@ di@@ st@@ sin from tar@@ tu in est@@ onia .
this is alfred gon@@ z@@ alex .
stephen watt .
b@@ j@@ tte s@@ und@@ in .
these are matthew anderson , t@@ ari@@ q al-@@ da@@ f and so on .
these people have come to wealth , but they &apos;ve made it illegal by using money to steal money from our bank , while we do our online banking , or key@@ log@@ ger that had collected our credit card information on the keyboard , while we &apos;re buying over a infected computer .
the u.s. intelligence service , two months ago , the swiss car account of mr. sam ja@@ in here , and on this account , 14@@ .@@ 9 million dollars was in the world .
mr. ja@@ in himself is on open foot , which is wrong .
and i would argue that today , we &apos;re more likely to be victims of the online , as an agreement in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is just getting worse .
in the future , most of the crime will play online .
the second largest community that we can see today is not driven by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- prote@@ sts , one opinion , or through their audience .
groups like anonymous , over the last 12 months , went up to one of the main players in the field of online attacks .
so , these are the three major attacks groups : criminals that do it in the money of the money , hackers like anonymous , who can afford resistance , but the last group are nations , governments who run the attacks .
there are cases , like the dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar .
it shows how it happens when governments attack their own citizens .
dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a complete criminal surgeon in the netherlands -- or it was .
in the last fall , it had to wake up in@@ sol@@ ra , because dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar had been ha@@ cked .
somebody was crushed , and he was ha@@ cked in the system .
and last week in a meeting with dutch government , i introduced one of these group to ask the question if he was able to get it for possible , that because of the dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar people .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how are people going to die like this ?
dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a certified place .
they sell kate .
what do you do with pupp@@ ers ?
well , a certificate requires if you have a website with h@@ tt@@ ps , with the encryp@@ ted services , for example , for instance .
now , we &apos;re all using , or many of us , g@@ mail or one of your competitors , but these services are particularly common in tot@@ al@@ itarian states like iran , where dissi@@ dents are in the dead states like iran , because you know that the local government can &apos;t be more than local , and that it can &apos;t be encryp@@ ted by the local government .
but if you &apos;re in a foreign .
it &apos;s a translator &apos;s office , and they &apos;re playing a fake board .
and that &apos;s the case of dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar .
how about the arab spring and things that are happening for example in egypt ?
now , in egypt , in egypt , the rise in april was the headquarters of the egyptian secret police , and they found a lot of records .
in this records , a folder was called &quot; fin@@ fisher . &quot;
and in this folder , notes in germany , the egyptian government , had sold a few programs that they were using -- in very large scale -- any communication of egyptian citizens .
they had sold this program for 28@@ 0,000 euros to the egyptian government .
the headquarters headquarters is right here .
so western governments have dead governments with aid , so that they can do against their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany , just a few weeks ago , the state of the state was found , and this was an tro@@ jan who was used by german government agencies to use their own citizens .
if you &apos;re suspicious in a criminal case , it will be quite safety with your phone .
but today we are far beyond that .
they tap their internet connection .
they use tools like the state of the state to play their computer with a tro@@ j@@ er , which allows them to monitor their entire communication , to listen to their online discussions , to collect their proper words .
so , if we think about these things , the obvious answer would be people , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but i don &apos;t care because i &apos;m a bra@@ ver citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not the debate .
it &apos;s not a choice between privacy and safety .
it &apos;s a choice between liberty and control .
and as we now , in 2011 , in the year 2011 , our governments like trust , it &apos;s the right thing that we &apos;re going to get .
and we trust , you know , we blind our blind government , a government that we may have in 50 years ?
these are the questions we have to deal with the next 50 years .
it might seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of concrete block .
the first concrete block , in 18@@ 68 , were made in 18@@ 68 , and came out of a simple idea : modul@@ es from cement measures that fit together .
concrete building blocks have been very quickly the most valued building unit in the world .
they made us able to build things that were bigger than us , buildings , bridges , a stone after the other .
it was essentially the concrete block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out of this .
it was called the &quot; automatically connected stone . &quot;
and within a few years , lego went into every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion rocks were produced -- or 75 rocks for every person on this planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create nice houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego made it possible for everybody .
lego basically has taken the concrete block , the building block of the world , and made a place for our imagination .
meanwhile , in the same year , the bell labs was the next revolution , the next building building .
the transistor was a little plastic unit that was made us from a world of static , covered tiles to a world where everything was interactive .
like the concrete block , the transistor allows us to build much more complex round@@ ade , a stone after the other .
but there &apos;s a major difference : the transistor was just for experts .
personally , i don &apos;t accept the building of our time for experts for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i began to explore this idea of how to put the power of engineers into the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing li@@ tt@@ ans .
let me show you how they work .
li@@ tt@@ ans are electronic modul@@ es that have a specific function .
they &apos;re fake , light , sound , engine and sensor .
and the best part is that they connect with magnets .
so you can &apos;t put it around .
the rocks are color@@ ing .
green is a source , blue is power , pink , and orange is wires .
so everything you need to do is connect a blue and a green one , and you can build very fast distances .
you put a blue one on a green , and you can make light .
you can put a switch in between , and you &apos;ve created a little di@@ mmer .
take the switch out of a pul@@ smo@@ du@@ l , which is here , and they made a little blind .
put that bu@@ zz@@ er on a extra effect , and they made a noise machine .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
beyond the simple game , li@@ tt@@ creatures are actually pretty powerful .
instead of programming , that you have to program , more walkable or le@@ ed , li@@ tt@@ ans allow you to code with simple , intuitive gestures .
so , to slow down or slow down , you just click at this button , and it makes the impulse faster or slower .
the idea behind li@@ tt@@ ans is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction in this world into a sustainable fashion .
lights , notes , solar elements , motors -- everything should be available .
we have li@@ tt@@ ans to children and see them playing with it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , how do you start to understand the electronics that relate to them and not learning in school .
for example , how a night works , or why the doors are open to the edges , or how an ipod respond to touch .
we &apos;ve also brought li@@ tt@@ ans to design schools .
so , for example , we had designers with no experience in electronic things that started playing with li@@ tt@@ ans as a material .
and here we see , with fil@@ z , paper and water bottles , like georgia ...
a few weeks ago , we brought li@@ tt@@ ans to risd , and we gave them some designers who had no technical experience -- just box , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; power . &quot;
so , here &apos;s an example of a project that they made , a movement of mov@@ tating con@@ bs .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
it &apos;s a hum@@ mer made of dough that &apos;s scared in darkness .
for those non-@@ engineers , li@@ tt@@ ans became another material , electronics just became another material .
and we want to make this material available for everyone .
so li@@ tt@@ alive is open source .
you can go to the website , you can go down all the design and make it yourself .
we want to create the world of the creation , the inventor , which is demanding , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , is yours .
so , go and start to invent them .
thank you .
